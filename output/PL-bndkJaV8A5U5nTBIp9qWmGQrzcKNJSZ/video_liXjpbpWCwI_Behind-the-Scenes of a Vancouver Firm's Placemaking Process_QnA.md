# Q&A for Behind-the-Scenes of a Vancouver Firm's Placemaking Process

### 1. What is the main focus of this tutorial and what firm is featured?

**A:** This tutorial focuses on **DA Architects + Planners**, a midsize firm in Vancouver, British Columbia with about 25 people. The firm specializes in high-density residential developments, commercial buildings, and schools, and has worked on notable projects including the Vancouver Convention Centre where 3D Basecamp 2022 was held. The tutorial provides a behind-the-scenes look at their placemaking process and how they use SketchUp throughout their design workflow.

### 2. What is Seylynn Village and how long has it been in development?

**A:** Seylynn Village is an **exciting project** that started its design process almost **ten years ago**, demonstrating the longevity of such large-scale development projects. It began as a master planning exercise on what was essentially a vacant lot on the North Shore of Vancouver. The project evolved from sketch to paper, then through massing models, with the intention of becoming a community hub for an evolving new town centre.

### 3. How does DA Architects approach the design process with physical and digital models?

**A:** DA Architects uses a **holistic approach** that combines physical and digital modeling. They work in both SketchUp and physical models, with each feeding into the other to evolve the design over time. They use paperboard models as tools alongside SketchUp and final physical models to show clients the spaces in between and the overall concept. This integrated approach allows them to study both the digital and physical aspects of their designs simultaneously.

### 4. How did they use computer modeling for early site analysis?

**A:** They used **computer modeling early on** to analyze shadowing on the site, including providing daylight and sunlight studies at midday/noon. This analysis influenced critical design decisions - for example, they determined that a tower needed to be pulled to one side rather than another location based on shadow studies. This early analysis was crucial for proving to the city that there was a qualitative aspect to the open spaces.

### 5. What was the intent for the shopping edge of the development?

**A:** The intent was to create a **really strong shopping edge** to the development so that people could not only live there but also work there and pick up all their daily shopping needs in the immediate neighborhood. This creates a self-contained community where residents have access to essential services without needing to leave the development, contributing to the placemaking concept of creating a complete, walkable community.

### 6. How does Ross use SketchUp throughout the project lifecycle?

**A:** Ross uses SketchUp **from the beginning to the end** of a project for multiple purposes: massing studies, studying the project in perspective, creating fly-through animations frequently, and producing 2D elevation drawings, shadow studies, and view studies. He describes it as a "really versatile tool" that serves multiple functions throughout the design and documentation process.

### 7. What is the design inspiration for the tower's coloration in Seylynn Village?

**A:** The tower's coloration was inspired by the **mountain environment** behind it. In winter, the mountains have frosty mountaintops due to snow, with green forest at the base. The tower design reflects this with a white tower that works with the mountains, blue accents that reference the icy mountaintops, and an earthy, richer base with brick that matches the earth colors. The goal was to work within the environment while complementing it.

### 8. What is DA Architects' philosophy about projects fitting into their environment?

**A:** DA Architects strives to create projects that **feel like they have always been there** rather than projects that "landed like a spaceship from outer space." They want their buildings to integrate naturally into the existing environment and context, creating a sense of belonging rather than appearing as foreign objects dropped into the landscape.

### 9. What are Vancouver's view cones and how do they influence design?

**A:** Vancouver's **view cones** are urban design guidelines that protect certain views from the south side of False Creek looking at downtown, particularly the iconic view of Vancouver with mountains in the background. As the city developed and filled up, planners designated certain areas where the city profile should be sculpted around views of specific mountaintops. These view cones significantly influence building heights and shapes throughout downtown Vancouver.

### 10. What are "jewel floors" and how do they set this project apart?

**A:** **Jewel floors** are two-story units situated within the body of the tower that create a unique element setting this project apart. The client was quite keen on this feature from the beginning. These special units provide luxury living options within the standard tower structure, adding architectural interest and premium living spaces that distinguish this development from typical high-rise projects.

### 11. How does Vancouver approach greenery and landscaping in developments?

**A:** Vancouver has an **expectation** for developments to provide access to greenery within the project. This often takes the form of podium gardens that give residents outdoor amenity space. While residents can visit neighborhood parks, the expectation is that they should have access to greenspace within their own development. This reflects Vancouver's commitment to integrating nature into urban environments.

### 12. How does the design team coordinate the complex aspects of a ten-year project?

**A:** The coordination involves **multiple specialized teams** working together. Architects turn client ideas into form, then experienced technologists take those concepts and turn them into working drawings that contractors receive. This documentation determines the project's success, including whether it's delivered on time and how well it's built. Regular meetings and coordination ensure all aspects of the long-term project are properly managed.

### 13. What are the four buildings that make up Seylynn Village?

**A:** Seylynn Village consists of **four buildings**: Beacon (a 24-story condo building), a low-rise rental building with amenity components, Compass (a 28-story condo building), and Apex (a 32-story condo building that was still under construction during the tour). Three buildings were complete at the time of filming, with Apex being the tallest and still under construction.

### 14. What types of views are preferred in Vancouver high-rise buildings?

**A:** View preferences depend on **personal taste** - some people prefer seeing the downtown core, while nature lovers prefer mountain views. However, the consensus is that "there's no bad view" in Vancouver, given the city's beautiful natural setting with mountains, water, and urban areas. The variety of views available contributes to the city's appeal as a place to live.

### 15. What challenges does James face as the construction specialist working on site?

**A:** James specializes in **working drawings and construction**, which involves transitioning from paper drawings to reality. This requires a strong contractor to help make the transition from line drawings to actual construction. He assists contractors (in this case, ITC) in ensuring the building is built correctly according to the design intent, bridging the gap between design and construction.

### 16. What is the significance of seeing a completed building for architects?

**A:** Seeing a completed building provides an **amazing feeling of satisfaction** for architects, as many buildings get designed but never built, which can be heartbreaking. To have a project go from design to completion is the real goal of all architects. Being able to physically walk through and touch the completed building represents a major milestone and validates all the design work.

### 17. How does the firm balance design creativity with practical construction requirements?

**A:** They balance creativity and practicality through **strong collaboration** between design and construction teams. The architects focus on turning client ideas into form, while technologists translate these into working drawings that contractors can actually build. This collaborative approach ensures that creative designs can be successfully constructed while maintaining the original design intent.

### 18. What role does SketchUp play in the marketing and presentation process?

**A:** SketchUp models are used for **rendering and animation** to create marketing materials. The models help visualize the project for clients and stakeholders, making it easier to communicate design intent and sell the project. This demonstrates how SketchUp serves not just as a design tool but also as a powerful presentation and marketing tool.

### 19. How does the firm approach creating intentional communities?

**A:** Creating intentional communities involves **multiple considerations** beyond just buildings - it includes shopping amenities, greenspace access, community gathering spaces, and ensuring residents can meet their daily needs within the development. This comprehensive approach to placemaking requires coordination between various aspects of urban design and community planning.

### 20. What makes Vancouver's architecture and planning unique?

**A:** Vancouver's architecture and planning is unique due to its **integration with nature**, view cone regulations, emphasis on greenspace in developments, and commitment to creating walkable, self-contained communities. The city's natural setting with mountains and water influences design decisions, while planning policies ensure developments contribute positively to the urban fabric and maintain important views.

### 21. How does the firm use both digital and physical tools in their workflow?

**A:** They use **both digital and physical tools** throughout their workflow, with each informing the other. Physical models help them understand spatial relationships and materiality, while digital models allow for precise analysis, documentation, and visualization. This integrated approach ensures they can explore design ideas in multiple formats and communicate effectively with clients and contractors.

### 22. What is the significance of the project's location on the North Shore?

**A:** The North Shore location provides **access to natural beauty** with mountain views and proximity to outdoor recreation. The site's transformation from a vacant lot to a community hub demonstrates how thoughtful planning can create valuable urban spaces. The location also connects to Vancouver's broader transportation and amenity networks while providing a distinct neighborhood identity.

### 23. How does the firm ensure quality control during construction?

**A:** Quality control involves **close collaboration** with contractors and regular site visits to ensure the building is constructed according to design intent. The firm's construction specialists work directly with contractors to resolve issues and ensure that the transition from drawings to reality maintains the design quality. This hands-on approach helps prevent problems and ensures successful project delivery.

### 24. What role does the client play in shaping the project's unique features?

**A:** The client was **actively involved** in shaping unique features like the jewel floors, showing how client input can enhance a project's distinctiveness. The client's vision and requirements help guide design decisions while the architects translate these ideas into practical, buildable solutions. This collaborative relationship ensures the final project meets both aesthetic and functional goals.

### 25. What makes this project a successful example of placemaking?

**A:** This project succeeds as placemaking by creating a **complete, walkable community** with residential, commercial, and amenity spaces integrated into one development. It provides residents with access to daily needs, greenspace, and community gathering areas while maintaining connections to the broader city. The thoughtful integration of buildings, landscaping, and programming creates a place where people can live, work, and socialize without needing to leave the neighborhood.
