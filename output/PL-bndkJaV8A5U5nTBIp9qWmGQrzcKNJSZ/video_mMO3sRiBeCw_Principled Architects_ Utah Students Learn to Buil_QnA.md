# Principled Architects  Utah Students Learn to Buil - Q&A

Q1. What is the unique aspect of the University of Utah's Design Build program?
A1. The unique aspect of the University of Utah's Design Build program is that the same group of students work on a project from concept to completion. They start with the design phase in Salt Lake City, and then move to Bluff, Utah, for the construction phase, living and working on-site for the entire semester.

Q2. Why do the students spend time learning about the Navajo Nation and their client before starting the design process?
A2. The students spend time learning about the Navajo Nation's culture, history, and their client's needs and preferences before starting the design process. This is to ensure that they understand the context and requirements of the project, and design a solution that truly meets the client's needs rather than making assumptions.

Q3. How does the instructor, Hiroko, describe the program's approach to learning and building?
A3. Hiroko describes the program's approach as a "barbecue style" of learning and building, where skilled and unskilled individuals come together, bring materials, prepare, build, and learn together through the process.

Q4. What are some of the design limitations the students face when building in a rural area like Bluff?
A4. Some of the design limitations include:
- A deadline based on the academic calendar
- Limitations on the length of materials (max 8 feet) due to transportation constraints
- Limitations on the weight of materials (max what two people can carry) due to lack of cranes
- No access to heavy machinery or equipment typically available on urban construction sites

Q5. How do the students ensure site safety during construction?
A5. The students conduct regular safety checks, with one student being responsible for sounding an alarm at set times (e.g., 11 AM) to remind everyone to pause and check for potential safety hazards.

Q6. What roles or responsibilities do individual students take on during the construction phase?
A6. Individual students are assigned specific responsibilities for different aspects of the construction, such as the exterior roof and water catchment system, plumbing, foundation, expansion plan, window locations, HVAC system, exterior siding, interiors, and trusses.

Q7. What was the biggest challenge for one of the students, Naren, in the design process?
A7. For Naren, the biggest challenge was figuring out how to translate the care and concern they all had for meeting the client's needs into an actual house design that satisfied everyone's perspectives.

Q8. How did the client, Herman, contribute to the project beyond providing the land?
A8. Herman contributed significantly by building a tarp structure and providing a refrigerator for the students, joining the concrete crew and helping with the concrete work, and generally accommodating and supporting the students throughout the project.

Q9. What software did the students use for design and analysis, and how did they find it helpful?
A9. The students primarily used SketchUp for design and modeling, and Sefaira (a SketchUp plugin) for daylighting analysis and optimizing window locations and sizes. They found SketchUp easy to learn and informative, with useful plugins and compatibility with other software.

Q10. What was the difference between this design-build experience and working in a traditional architecture firm, according to Naren?
A10. In Naren's previous experience working at architecture firms, he never met the client directly and only interacted with project managers. This project was the first time he had the opportunity to interact with and build a relationship with the actual client, which he found to be a valuable and rewarding experience.

Q11. How did the students adapt their design when faced with real-world constraints during construction?
A11. When faced with constraints like not being able to make the wall studs small enough to accommodate the originally planned window locations, the students adapted by turning one window into an emergency exit and adding a larger window in the kitchen to improve daylighting. They constantly received feedback through renderings and models, and updated the design accordingly.

Q12. What was the significance of the students using natural materials to create tiles in the design exercise?
A12. The design exercise of using natural materials to create tiles allowed the students to explore the use of locally available and sustainable materials in their designs, potentially incorporating elements of the local culture and environment.

Q13. How did the students approach the floor plan design for the project?
A13. The students initially split into three groups, each designing their own floor plan. During the midterm, they combined the best elements from all three designs into a single, cohesive floor plan that became the final design for the project.

Q14. What was the importance of using renderings and models throughout the design process?
A14. The students regularly showed updated renderings and models to the clients during meetings throughout the semester. This helped the clients understand how the project was progressing, visualize the final product, and provide feedback on aspects like colors, layouts, and design elements.

Q15. What was the instructor's perspective on the emotional impact of the project on the clients and students?
A15. According to the instructor, almost every year, regardless of what happens, the client (homeowner) and the students end up shedding tears of joy and emotion when the house is completed, as it represents the realization of a dream home for the client and the culmination of the students' efforts.

Q16. How did the clients' perspective on the house size evolve during the project?
A16. Initially, the clients were surprised and felt that a 700 square foot house would be too small to fit everything they needed. However, as the project progressed, they became more flexible and realized that they could accommodate their needs within the given space through thoughtful design.

Q17. What was the significance of the students learning to have a "plan B" during the design and construction process?
A17. Learning to have a "plan B" was important for the students, as it taught them the need to be flexible and adaptable when faced with real-world constraints or changes during the construction process, rather than rigidly sticking to the original plan.

Q18. How did the program foster a sense of community and apprenticeship among the students?
A18. By living and working together on-site for an entire semester, the program fostered a strong sense of community and apprenticeship among the students. They learned from each other, collaborated closely, and experienced the entire process of designing and building a home together as a cohesive group.

Q19. What was the significance of the program's focus on compassion for those in need of housing?
A19. The program's focus on compassion for those in need of housing was reflected in their collaboration with the Navajo Nation to design and build affordable housing for community members. This instilled a sense of social responsibility and awareness of the importance of providing accessible housing solutions.

Q20. How did the experience of cooking and sharing a pizza together contribute to the overall learning experience?
A20. The experience of cooking and sharing a wood-fired pizza together reinforced the program's "barbecue style" approach to learning and building, where everyone comes together, contributes their skills, and learns through hands-on collaboration and community-building activities.

Q21. What was the purpose of the design exercise where students discussed using natural materials to create tiles?
A21. The design exercise where students discussed using natural materials to create tiles aimed to explore the use of locally available and sustainable materials in their designs, potentially incorporating elements of the local culture and environment.

Q22. How did the students approach the issue of daylighting and natural lighting in their design?
A22. The students used Sefaira, a SketchUp plugin, to analyze and optimize daylighting and natural lighting in their design. They adjusted window locations, sizes, and elevations based on the analysis to ensure adequate natural light penetration into the living spaces, particularly the kitchen area.

Q23. How did the students address the client's preference for maintaining a view towards the East in their design?
A23. To accommodate the client's preference for maintaining a view towards the East, the students initially planned to have a door with a window facing that direction. However, when they encountered lighting issues, they added a larger window on the South side to improve daylighting while still preserving the desired view towards the East.

Q24. How did the students incorporate feedback and make design decisions throughout the project?
A24. The students regularly showed updated renderings and models to the clients during meetings throughout the semester. Based on the feedback received from the clients regarding aspects like colors, layouts, and design elements, the students iteratively updated and refined their design decisions.

Q25. What was the significance of the students' ability to understand and accommodate the constraints faced by contractors and trades during the construction phase?
A25. By experiencing the construction phase firsthand, the students gained an understanding of the practical constraints and challenges faced by contractors and trades, such as the inability to move plumbing pipes or make certain modifications. This knowledge will help them design more pragmatic and constructible solutions in the future, bridging the gap between design and construction.
