# Inside the Complex Construction of Seattle's New A - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of the project being discussed in the video?
A1. The video discusses the construction of the Ocean Pavilion expansion at the Seattle Aquarium, which is a complex and challenging project involving the creation of new aquarium habitats and exhibits.

Q2. Who is Drew Mark, and what is his role in the project?
A2. Drew Mark is a Senior Project Manager for Turner Construction, and he is considered the "aquarium guy" for Turner, having been involved in multiple aquarium projects over his 25-year career.

Q3. What is the first thing visitors will see before entering the aquarium?
A3. Before even buying a ticket, visitors will be able to see an acrylic window that looks up into the reef exhibit, allowing them to view the sharks and other species swimming overhead.

Q4. What are some of the complex systems involved in aquariums that most visitors don't think about?
A4. Aquariums are dense with mechanical, electrical, hydronic, and life support systems, including sand filters, foam fractionators, U.V. sterilizers, ozone systems, and degas towers, which are necessary for cleaning and filtering the water for the animals.

Q5. What is the Shotcrete technique used for in the Archipelagos exhibit?
A5. The Shotcrete technique involves using a nozzle to shoot concrete combined with air onto rebar, allowing the concrete to stick and build out the final surface of the backdrop in the Archipelagos exhibit.

Q6. What is unique about the feature stair in the One Ocean Hall?
A6. The feature stair in the One Ocean Hall has helical stringers, making it very complex to fabricate, adding another challenge to the already challenging project.

Q7. How much concrete was poured for the main habitat, and what was the process like?
A7. All of the concrete for the main habitat, which is massive enough to fit a house inside without touching the edges, was poured in a single day. The process involved carefully planning and modeling the pour in sections to ensure the formwork could withstand the pressure and the team knew the pour rate in real-time.

Q8. What is the purpose of the Overlook Walk structure?
A8. The Overlook Walk structure will be a public roof area where visitors can walk and enjoy views of the Puget Sound, West Seattle, and the Olympic Peninsula mountains.

Q9. What is the role of the VDC (Virtual Design and Construction) team in the project?
A9. The VDC team, led by VDC Project Manager Sa, is responsible for concrete modeling, concrete coordination, and pushing the boundaries of what modeling and VDC can achieve on a construction site.

Q10. How does SketchUp benefit the logistics planning process for the project?
A10. SketchUp is a user-friendly tool that allows for quick modeling, easy collaboration with superintendents who have SketchUp experience, and the ability to integrate point clouds of existing conditions using the Scan Essentials extension.

Q11. What was the design and build process like for the VDC team on this project?
A11. Unlike typical projects where the VDC team is given final details, for the Ocean Pavilion project, the team had to solve many details and missing information during the modeling process, making it a more design and build process.

Q12. How did the VDC team approach the modeling and preparation of the complex shapes for construction?
A12. The VDC team broke down the complex shapes into separate scenes and blocks in SketchUp, allowing them to overlay and visualize the assembly process. They also prepared IKEA-style assembly drawings in LayOut for easy communication with the construction team.

Q13. What is Sebastian's background with SketchUp, and how did it contribute to his work on this project?
A13. Sebastian previously worked for Joshua Cohen at Fat Pencil Studio, a well-known SketchUp firm, and has been working with SketchUp since early on. This experience made him a SketchUp expert and allowed him to push the limits of LayOut on this complex project.

Q14. What is the purpose of the prefab shop at Turner's VDC office?
A14. The prefab shop is where Turner does digital fabrication for their projects, using CNC machines to cut formwork pieces that are labeled and can be easily assembled on site based on the SketchUp model.

Q15. How was the formwork for the oculus (the large acrylic piece) created and installed?
A15. The formwork for the 20-foot diameter oculus was built in two halves in the prefab shop, shipped to the site, bolted together, and then lifted into place by a crane as a single section, using the SketchUp model for precise placement.

Q16. How does the survey crew utilize the SketchUp model on site?
A16. The survey crew can access the SketchUp model on Trimble Connect and use a Total Station to shoot the points from the model, ensuring that the formwork is placed in the correct location according to the model.

Q17. What are some of the smaller models and scopes that the VDC team helped coordinate?
A17. The VDC team created models for various smaller scopes, such as bosun chairs (maintenance seats connected to overhead rails), door swings, jib cranes, and elevators, to ensure proper clearances and coordination.

Q18. How did the VDC team use field data from the Total Station to update the model?
A18. The VDC team received point data from the Total Station in the field and used it to compare the designed location of embeds to the actual conditions. They then modeled plates in SketchUp to recommend adjustments and ensure a perfect fit against the large habitat geometry.

Q19. What makes SketchUp an effective tool for communication and problem-solving on this project?
A19. SketchUp's intuitive interface and ability to easily manipulate and storytell with modeled content made it effective for the team to collaborate, follow along with solutions, and work through problems together.

Q20. What was the overall approach and mindset that allowed the team to overcome challenges on this ambitious project?
A20. The team maintained an attitude of open communication, collaboration, and a willingness to work together with various stakeholders (design team, rebar contractors, concrete suppliers, formwork experts) to find solutions rather than giving up when faced with challenges.

Q21. What is the significance of this project for the team members involved?
A21. For the team members, this ambitious and striking project will serve as a case study of their construction capabilities and a source of accomplishment, especially when visiting the completed aquarium with their families in the future.
