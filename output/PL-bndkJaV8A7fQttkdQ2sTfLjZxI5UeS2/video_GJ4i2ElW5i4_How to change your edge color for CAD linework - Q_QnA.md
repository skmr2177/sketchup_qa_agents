# How to change your edge color for CAD linework - Q - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of changing edge colors in SketchUp?
A1. Changing edge colors in SketchUp can be useful when tracing over line work, such as CAD floor plans. It allows you to differentiate between the original CAD lines and the new lines you draw on top, making it easier to distinguish between the two.

Q2. How do you access the edge color settings in SketchUp?
A2. To access the edge color settings in SketchUp, go to the Styles panel and click on the "Edit" tab. Here, you can switch your edge color to "By Material" or choose a specific color.

Q3. What is the "By Material" option for edge color?
A3. The "By Material" option for edge color in SketchUp allows you to assign different edge colors to different materials in your model. This can be useful when working with various materials or when tracing over existing linework.

Q4. How do you assign a specific color to a group of edges?
A4. To assign a specific color to a group of edges in SketchUp, follow these steps:
1. Select the group of edges you want to color (e.g., your CAD linework group).
2. In the Entity Info panel, locate the "Color" option.
3. Click on the color swatch and choose the desired color from the color picker.

Q5. What is the benefit of differentiating between the original CAD lines and the new lines drawn on top?
A5. Differentiating between the original CAD lines and the new lines drawn on top can help you easily identify and distinguish between the two sets of lines. This can be particularly useful when working with complex drawings or when making modifications to the existing linework.

Q6. Can you change the edge color of individual edges or faces in SketchUp?
A6. Yes, in SketchUp, you can change the edge color of individual edges or faces. Simply select the specific edges or faces you want to color, and then follow the steps mentioned in Q4 to assign a desired color.

Q7. Is there a way to quickly reset the edge colors to their default settings?
A7. Yes, you can quickly reset the edge colors to their default settings in SketchUp. In the Styles panel, under the "Edit" tab, select the "Reset Tray" option. This will reset all edge colors to their default state.

Q8. Can you apply different edge colors to different layers in SketchUp?
A8. Yes, you can apply different edge colors to different layers in SketchUp. By assigning different materials to different layers and then using the "By Material" option for edge color, you can automatically assign different edge colors to each layer.

Q9. Is it possible to create custom edge color styles in SketchUp?
A9. Yes, SketchUp allows you to create custom edge color styles. You can define your own color schemes and save them as custom styles in the Styles panel. These custom styles can then be easily applied to your models as needed.

Q10. Can you export or import edge color settings in SketchUp?
A10. Yes, SketchUp allows you to export and import edge color settings along with other model properties. You can export your edge color settings as part of a SketchUp style file (.style) and then import that style file into other SketchUp projects or share it with others.
