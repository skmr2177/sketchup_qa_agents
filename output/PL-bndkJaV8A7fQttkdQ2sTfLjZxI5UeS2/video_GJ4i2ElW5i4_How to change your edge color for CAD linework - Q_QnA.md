# How to change your edge color for CAD linework - Quick Win

### 1. What is the main benefit of having multiple edge colors in your SketchUp model?
**Answer:**
Eric explains that having more than one edge color "comes in handy when tracing over line work like this CAD floor plan." This allows you to visually differentiate between your original CAD reference material and the new lines you're drawing on top. By using different edge colors, you can clearly distinguish between the base CAD drawing and your new SketchUp work, making the tracing process much more efficient and reducing confusion about which lines are which.

### 2. How do you access the edge color settings in SketchUp?
**Answer:**
Eric shows that you access edge color settings in the Styles panel under Edit. He specifically mentions going to the "stylus panel under edit" to switch the edge color to "by material." This setting allows you to control edge colors based on the materials applied to different parts of your model, rather than having all edges use the same color.

### 3. What is the "by material" edge color setting and how does it work?
**Answer:**
The "by material" edge color setting allows edges to take on the color of the material they're associated with. This means that when you apply different colors to different parts of your model (like your CAD linework group), the edges will automatically match those colors. This creates visual separation between different elements in your model, making it easier to distinguish between reference material and new work.

### 4. How do you apply a color to your CAD linework group?
**Answer:**
Eric demonstrates selecting the CAD linework group and then going to Entity Info to add a color. He shows that once you select the group, you can apply a color through the Entity Info panel, which will then make the edges of that group appear in that color. This creates the visual differentiation between the CAD base and the new lines drawn on top.

### 5. What is the result of changing edge colors for CAD linework?
**Answer:**
After applying the color to the CAD linework group, Eric shows that you can now "differentiated between my CAD base and my new lines drawn right on top." The CAD lines appear in the color you assigned, while your new SketchUp lines remain in the default edge color, creating clear visual separation. This makes it much easier to see what you've drawn versus what was in the original reference material.

### 6. Why is this technique particularly useful for tracing workflows?
**Answer:**
This technique is especially valuable for tracing because it solves the common problem of losing track of which lines are original reference material and which are your new work. When you're drawing new lines on top of existing CAD linework, it can become confusing to distinguish between the two. By giving the CAD lines a different edge color, you maintain clear visual separation throughout the tracing process, making it easier to see your progress and avoid confusion.

### 7. How does this quick win technique improve workflow efficiency?
**Answer:**
Eric presents this as a "quick win" because it's a simple technique that provides immediate visual benefits. Instead of having to constantly toggle layers or reference images on and off to see your progress, you can work with both the reference material and your new lines visible simultaneously. This saves time and reduces the need to switch between different views or settings while working.

### 8. What types of projects would benefit most from this edge color technique?
**Answer:**
This technique is particularly beneficial for projects involving tracing over imported CAD drawings, floor plans, or any reference material where you need to draw new lines on top of existing linework. It's especially useful for architectural projects, renovation work, or any situation where you're converting 2D drawings into 3D models. The technique helps maintain clarity when working with complex reference materials.

### 9. How does this technique relate to other SketchUp edge color options?
**Answer:**
Eric specifically mentions the "by material" setting, but SketchUp offers other edge color options as well. The "by material" setting is particularly useful for this workflow because it allows you to control edge colors through the material system, making it easy to assign different colors to different groups or components. This is more flexible than using a single edge color for the entire model.

### 10. What makes this a "quick win" rather than a complex workflow?
**Answer:**
Eric calls this a "quick win" because it requires only a few simple steps: switching the edge color setting to "by material," selecting your CAD group, and applying a color through Entity Info. There's no complex setup, no need to create custom styles, and no requirement to modify your existing workflow. It's a straightforward technique that provides immediate visual benefits with minimal effort, making it an easy improvement to implement in any tracing project.
