# Tracing Reference Images - Skill Builder

### 1. What is the main problem Eric identifies when tracing over imported reference images?
**Answer:**
Eric explains that when drawing black lines in SketchUp on top of black lines in imported images, it becomes "hard for me to see what I've just drawn." This visibility issue makes the drafting process inefficient because he can't clearly distinguish between the reference material and his new work. He demonstrates this by drawing lines over an imported plan and showing how they blend together, making it difficult to track progress.

### 2. How does Eric solve the visibility problem using X-Ray mode?
**Answer:**
Eric goes to View → Face Style → X-Ray, which does two things: it "fades the image back a little bit making the lines a little easier to see" and "makes the faces transparent so I can continue just to draft the details actually on top of the faces that are covering the reference plan." This allows him to see through any faces he creates while tracing, maintaining visibility of the underlying reference material.

### 3. How does Eric create a custom tracing style with colored lines?
**Answer:**
Eric opens the Styles panel and goes to Edit to change the line color. He chooses hot pink because it contrasts well with the plan he's drawing on top of, though he notes "you can use any color you want as long as it contrasts with the plan." After making the change, he saves it as a new style using the plus icon, allowing him to switch between the default style and his custom tracing style.

### 4. How does Eric set up scenes for efficient tracing workflow?
**Answer:**
Eric creates two scenes: one with the tracing style applied and one with the default style. He disables camera location for both scenes by opening the dropdown in the scenes window and unchecking camera location for each. This allows him to work in different areas of the model without losing his position when switching between scenes. He also turns off the reference image in the default scene to see his progress clearly.

### 5. Why does Eric disable camera location in his tracing scenes?
**Answer:**
Eric disables camera location because without it, switching between scenes would take him back to the original camera position where he left off. He demonstrates this by showing how going back to the default scene would return him to the kitchen area, but he wants to stay focused on the lounge area he's currently working on. With camera location disabled, he can work anywhere in the model and switch between tracing and review modes without losing his current position.

### 6. How does Eric create a template for image tracing projects?
**Answer:**
Eric saves his tracing setup as a template by going to File → Save as Template and naming it "image trace." He keeps the styles, scenes, and reference tag in the model when creating the template, then purges everything else. Later, he can access this template through File → New from Template → My Templates. He notes that you probably don't want this as your default template unless you only trace images.

### 7. How does Eric organize his reference images using tags?
**Answer:**
Eric assigns his imported reference plan to its own tag so he can toggle it on and off. This gives him control over when to show or hide the reference material. He demonstrates this by showing how the reference image can be turned off to see his progress clearly, then turned back on to continue tracing. This organization helps keep the model clean and allows for efficient workflow management.

### 8. What happens when Eric draws a rectangle over the reference image?
**Answer:**
When Eric uses the rectangle tool to draw over the reference image, "a face automatically fills in over the top" which covers the reference material underneath. This is problematic because he has "more details I want to draw here" and needs to see the reference plan. This is why he uses X-Ray mode - it makes the faces transparent so he can continue drafting details on top of the faces while still seeing the reference material.

### 9. How does Eric demonstrate the template workflow with a new project?
**Answer:**
Eric shows how easy it is to use the template by dragging in a new image (a cabin concept floor plan sketch) and simply applying it to the reference tag. All the other settings (styles, scenes) are already there from the template. He then demonstrates drawing some quick line work on top to show how the tracing workflow works with the new reference material.

### 10. What is Eric's overall approach to making the tracing process more efficient?
**Answer:**
Eric's approach focuses on setting up the right tools and workflow upfront to make the entire drafting process run "as efficiently as possible." He emphasizes that while setting up custom styles and scenes might seem like extra work, it pays off in the long run. He creates a template so he doesn't have to "do that every single time" and can quickly get up and running with new tracing projects. The key is having the right visual setup (X-Ray mode, contrasting line colors) and efficient scene management to maintain focus and productivity.
