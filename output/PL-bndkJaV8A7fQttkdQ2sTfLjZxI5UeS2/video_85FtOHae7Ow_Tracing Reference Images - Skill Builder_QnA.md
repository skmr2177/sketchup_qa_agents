# Tracing Reference Images - Skill Builder - Q&A

Q1. What is the main purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The main purpose of this tutorial is to share tips for tracing and drafting on top of imported reference images in SketchUp, such as architectural plans, hand sketches, or photographs.

Q2. Why is it sometimes difficult to see the lines drawn on top of a reference image?
A2. When drawing black lines in SketchUp on top of black lines in the reference image, it can be hard to distinguish the newly drawn lines from the existing lines in the image.

Q3. What is the first tip mentioned for improving visibility when tracing?
A3. The first tip is to go to View > Face Style > X-Ray. This fades the reference image back a bit, making the lines easier to see, and also makes the faces transparent, allowing you to draft details on top of them.

Q4. How can you change the line color to improve visibility?
A4. You can go to Edit and change the line color to a contrasting color like hot pink. This makes the lines stand out better against the reference image. Save this as a new style by going to Styles and clicking the plus icon.

Q5. How can you create scenes to switch between tracing and default styles?
A5. Create two new scenes, one with the default style applied and one with the tracing style applied. Disable the camera location for both scenes so that you can switch between them without changing the view.

Q6. Why is disabling the camera location for scenes useful?
A6. Disabling the camera location for scenes allows you to switch between the tracing and default scenes without changing the view or zooming back to the original location. This helps you stay focused on the area you're working on.

Q7. How can you save the tracing setup as a template for future use?
A7. Go to File > Save as Template and give it a descriptive name like "Image Trace". This saves the styles, scenes, and reference image tag settings as a template for future use.

Q8. How do you start a new project using the tracing template?
A8. Go to File > New from Template and select the "Image Trace" template you created. This will launch SketchUp with the tracing setup already configured.

Q9. What is the benefit of using a tracing template?
A9. Using a tracing template saves time by having the styles, scenes, and reference image tag settings already set up, allowing you to quickly import a new reference image and start tracing without repeating the setup process.

Q10. What types of reference images can be used for tracing in SketchUp?
A10. The tutorial mentions using imported CAD surveys, hand sketches, and photographs as reference images for tracing in SketchUp.

Q11. How do you import and scale a reference image in SketchUp?
A11. The tutorial assumes that the reference plan has already been imported and scaled, but does not provide specific steps for this process.

Q12. How do you assign a reference image to a tag in SketchUp?
A12. The tutorial mentions that the reference plan has been assigned to its own tag, which allows you to toggle its visibility on and off, but does not provide specific steps for assigning an image to a tag.

Q13. What is the purpose of using the Rectangle tool when tracing?
A13. The tutorial demonstrates using the Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle over the top of a table in the reference image, showing that a face automatically fills in over the top, which can obscure details you want to trace underneath.

Q14. What is the purpose of the X-Ray face style?
A14. The X-Ray face style fades the reference image back a bit, making lines easier to see, and also makes faces transparent, allowing you to draft details on top of them without being obscured.

Q15. How do you create a new style in SketchUp?
A15. To create a new style, go to Edit and change the desired settings (e.g., line color), then go to Styles and click the plus icon to save the changes as a new style.

Q16. How do you apply a style to a scene in SketchUp?
A16. To apply a style to a scene, create a new scene, then in the Scenes window or the Scene tab, make sure the desired style is applied, and click Update to save the scene with that style.

Q17. How do you toggle the visibility of a reference image in SketchUp?
A17. The tutorial mentions that the reference image has been assigned to its own tag, which allows you to toggle its visibility on and off, but does not provide specific steps for toggling visibility.

Q18. What is the purpose of disabling the camera location for scenes?
A18. Disabling the camera location for scenes allows you to switch between scenes without changing the view or zooming back to the original location, which helps you stay focused on the area you're working on.

Q19. How do you disable the camera location for a scene in SketchUp?
A19. To disable the camera location for a scene, open the Scenes window, click the drop-down menu for the scene, and uncheck the "Camera Location" option.

Q20. What is the benefit of saving a tracing setup as a template?
A20. Saving a tracing setup as a template allows you to quickly start a new project with the desired styles, scenes, and reference image tag settings already configured, saving time and effort.

Q21. How do you overwrite an existing template in SketchUp?
A21. The tutorial does not provide specific steps for overwriting an existing template, but it mentions that if a template with the same name already exists, it will prompt you to overwrite it.

Q22. How do you launch a new project from a template in SketchUp?
A22. To launch a new project from a template, go to File > New from Template, then navigate to the "My Templates" section and select the desired template.

Q23. What is the purpose of applying a reference image to a tag?
A23. Applying a reference image to a tag allows you to toggle its visibility on and off, which can be useful when tracing or drafting on top of the image.

Q24. How do you switch between the tracing and default scenes in SketchUp?
A24. To switch between the tracing and default scenes, click on the Scene tab or use the Scenes window to select the desired scene.

Q25. What is the recommended workflow for tracing on top of a reference image using the techniques shown in the tutorial?
A25. The recommended workflow is:
1. Import and scale the reference image.
2. Assign the image to a tag.
3. Create a tracing style with a contrasting line color.
4. Create two scenes: one with the default style and one with the tracing style.
5. Disable the camera location for both scenes.
6. Switch between the scenes to toggle between tracing and default modes.
7. Save the setup as a template for future use.
