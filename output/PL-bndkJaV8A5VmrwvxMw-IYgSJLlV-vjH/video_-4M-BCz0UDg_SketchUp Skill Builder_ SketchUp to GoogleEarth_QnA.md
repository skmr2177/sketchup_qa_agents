# Q&A for SketchUp Skill Builder: SketchUp to GoogleEarth

### 1. What is the main question this tutorial addresses and what is the good news?

**A:** The tutorial addresses questions about how the **new geo-location using Digital Globe** works with placing models in Google Earth. The good news is that it works, and even better news is that it's pretty simple. Aaron demonstrates that the transition from Google Earth to Digital Globe doesn't affect the ability to place and view models in Google Earth.

### 2. What is the first step in the geo-location process?

**A:** The first step is to **go to File > Geo-location** and click "Add Location." This opens the Add Location window where you can select the geographic area for your model. During the transition from Google Earth to Digital Globe, there's a notification that the layers button allows you to switch providers.

### 3. How does Aaron choose the location and what does he select?

**A:** Aaron zooms in on a **section of Boulder, Colorado** that he knows is open, specifically behind a hospital. He selects a region by zooming out to get more buildings in the selection area, then grabs that region. This imports information from Digital Globe and places it onto his modeling window, just like the previous Google Earth process.

### 4. What type of model does Aaron create for demonstration?

**A:** Aaron creates a **quick building** as a reference model that can be pulled into Google Earth. This simple building serves as a test case to demonstrate the complete workflow from SketchUp geo-location to Google Earth placement.

### 5. What file format is required for Google Earth import and how do you export it?

**A:** You need to export as a **.kmz file**, which is the file type that Google Earth can import. Aaron goes to File > Export 3D Model, chooses .kmz as the file type, gives it a name, and exports it. This creates the file that can be opened in Google Earth.

### 6. How does the import process work in Google Earth?

**A:** In Google Earth, you **zoom to approximately the same location** (it doesn't need to be the exact same spot), then go to File > Open and select the .kmz file. Google Earth automatically zooms in very specifically to where the model should be placed and puts it into the view.

### 7. What confirms that the geo-location coordinates are working correctly?

**A:** The model **knows exactly where it's supposed to go** because the coordinates are the same. Aaron notes that the fact that it came from a different provider (Digital Globe instead of Google Earth) for the geo-location really made no difference - the model is available and visible in Google Earth with the correct positioning.

### 8. How can you adjust the model's position if there are discrepancies?

**A:** You can **move the model around** in Google Earth if there are any discrepancies. Go to the Places toolbar and click the little down arrow next to your model. You'll see a model link at the bottom. Right-click and hit "Get Info" to bring up information about the model and give you grips for manipulation.

### 9. What controls are available for adjusting the model in Google Earth?

**A:** You can use the **center grip** to move the model wherever you need it, and you also have **rotation controls**. The model may jump a little as it tries to ride the geometry of Google Earth, but this gives you the ability to place it exactly where you want it to be.

### 10. What is the significance of the provider transition from Google Earth to Digital Globe?

**A:** The transition to **Digital Globe** as the satellite imagery provider doesn't affect the core functionality. The coordinates remain the same, and the workflow for placing models in Google Earth remains unchanged. This demonstrates that the geo-location system is provider-agnostic.

### 11. How does the selection process work for the geo-location area?

**A:** You can **zoom in and out** to select the appropriate region. Aaron zooms out to get more buildings in the selection area, ensuring he captures the desired geographic context. The selection process is flexible and allows you to choose the exact area you need for your project.

### 12. What is the advantage of using Digital Globe imagery for geo-location?

**A:** **Digital Globe imagery** provides high-quality satellite data that can be used for geo-location in SketchUp. The transition to Digital Globe maintains the same workflow while potentially providing different or updated imagery compared to the previous Google Earth integration.

### 13. How does the automatic zoom feature work in Google Earth?

**A:** When you open a .kmz file, Google Earth **automatically zooms in very specifically** to where the model should be placed. This feature ensures that the model appears in the correct location without requiring manual navigation to find it.

### 14. What is the purpose of the "Get Info" option in Google Earth?

**A:** The "Get Info" option provides **detailed information about the model** and gives you manipulation grips. This allows you to access the model's properties and make adjustments to its position and orientation if needed.

### 15. How does the model's interaction with Google Earth's geometry work?

**A:** The model **tries to ride the geometry of Google Earth** when you move it, which can cause it to jump a little as it adjusts to the terrain. This is normal behavior as the model adapts to the 3D terrain data in Google Earth.

### 16. What makes this process simple compared to other 3D modeling workflows?

**A:** The process is **straightforward and automated** - you geo-locate in SketchUp, export as .kmz, and import into Google Earth. The coordinate system handles the positioning automatically, and any adjustments can be made easily through the Google Earth interface.

### 17. How does the coordinate system ensure accurate placement?

**A:** The **coordinate system** maintains consistency between SketchUp and Google Earth, ensuring that models placed in one application appear in the correct location in the other. This coordinate-based approach makes the process reliable and predictable.

### 18. What types of projects benefit from this SketchUp to Google Earth workflow?

**A:** This workflow is ideal for **site-specific projects** like architectural designs, urban planning, landscape design, or any project that needs to be viewed in its real-world context. It's particularly useful for presentations and client communication.

### 19. How does the provider switching feature work in the Add Location window?

**A:** The **layers button** in the Add Location window allows you to switch between different imagery providers. During the transition period, there's a notification about this feature, giving users the option to choose their preferred satellite imagery source.

### 20. What is the significance of the automatic positioning in Google Earth?

**A:** The **automatic positioning** feature ensures that models appear in the correct geographic location without manual intervention. This saves time and reduces errors, making the workflow more efficient and user-friendly.

### 21. How does the rotation control work in Google Earth?

**A:** The **rotation controls** allow you to adjust the orientation of the model within Google Earth. This is useful for aligning the model with the surrounding context or correcting any orientation issues that might occur during the import process.

### 22. What is the advantage of the .kmz file format?

**A:** The **.kmz format** is specifically designed for Google Earth and includes all necessary information for proper placement, including coordinates, scale, and orientation. It's a compressed format that's efficient for sharing and distribution.

### 23. How does the terrain following work in Google Earth?

**A:** When you move models in Google Earth, they **follow the terrain geometry**, adjusting their position to match the 3D terrain data. This ensures that models sit properly on the ground surface rather than floating or intersecting with the terrain.

### 24. What makes this workflow accessible to different skill levels?

**A:** The workflow is **intuitive and automated** - the coordinate system handles the complex positioning calculations, and the interface provides clear options for adjustments. This makes it accessible to users of various skill levels.

### 25. How does this process demonstrate the integration between SketchUp and Google Earth?

**A:** This process shows **seamless integration** between the two platforms - models created in SketchUp with geo-location can be directly viewed in Google Earth with accurate positioning. This integration enables powerful workflows for site-specific design and visualization.

This comprehensive Q&A covers the complete SketchUp to Google Earth tutorial, including specific techniques for geo-location, file export/import, and model positioning in Google Earth.
