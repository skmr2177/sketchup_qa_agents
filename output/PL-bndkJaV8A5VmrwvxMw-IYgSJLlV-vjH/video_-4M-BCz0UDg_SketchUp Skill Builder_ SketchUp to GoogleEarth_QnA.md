# SketchUp Skill Builder  SketchUp to GoogleEarth - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create a geo-located model in SketchUp using Digital Globe imagery and then export it to view in Google Earth.

Q2. How do you start the geo-location process in SketchUp?
A2. To start the geo-location process in SketchUp, go to File > Geo-location and click "Add Location".

Q3. What notification appears during the transition from Google Earth to Digital Globe?
A3. During the transition from Google Earth to Digital Globe, a notification appears stating that the "layers" button will allow you to switch providers.

Q4. How do you select the area to geo-locate in SketchUp?
A4. To select the area to geo-locate, zoom in to the desired location, then use the selection tool to draw a rectangle around the area you want to import.

Q5. What file format is required to export a model from SketchUp for use in Google Earth?
A5. The required file format to export a model from SketchUp for use in Google Earth is .kmz.

Q6. How do you export a model from SketchUp as a .kmz file?
A6. To export a model from SketchUp as a .kmz file, go to File > Export 3D Model, select the .kmz file type, and choose a name and location to save the file.

Q7. How do you import the exported .kmz file into Google Earth?
A7. To import the exported .kmz file into Google Earth, open Google Earth, navigate to the approximate location, go to File > Open, and select the .kmz file.

Q8. What happens when you open the .kmz file in Google Earth?
A8. When you open the .kmz file in Google Earth, it will zoom in to the specific location where the model was geo-located and place the model in that location.

Q9. How can you adjust the position of the model in Google Earth if it is not placed correctly?
A9. If the model is not placed correctly in Google Earth, you can adjust its position by going to the Places menu, right-clicking on the model, selecting "Get Info", and then using the center grip to move the model or the rotation control to rotate it.

Q10. What is the significance of being able to geo-locate a model using Digital Globe imagery and view it in Google Earth?
A10. The ability to geo-locate a model using Digital Globe imagery and view it in Google Earth allows you to create accurate, real-world representations of buildings or structures and visualize them in their intended location within the Google Earth environment.

Q11. What is the purpose of the "layers" button mentioned in the tutorial?
A11. The "layers" button allows you to switch between different providers of satellite imagery, such as Google Earth and Digital Globe, during the geo-location process in SketchUp.

Q12. How do you zoom in and out in the Digital Globe imagery in SketchUp?
A12. To zoom in and out in the Digital Globe imagery in SketchUp, you can use the zoom tools or the scroll wheel on your mouse.

Q13. What is the significance of the geo-location coordinates being the same between SketchUp and Google Earth?
A13. The fact that the geo-location coordinates are the same between SketchUp and Google Earth ensures that the model is placed accurately in the correct location when imported into Google Earth.

Q14. What is the purpose of the "Places" menu in Google Earth?
A14. The "Places" menu in Google Earth allows you to access and manage imported models, placemarks, and other geographic data.

Q15. How do you access the information and adjustment controls for an imported model in Google Earth?
A15. To access the information and adjustment controls for an imported model in Google Earth, go to the Places menu, right-click on the model, and select "Get Info". This will bring up the model information and grips for moving and rotating the model.

Q16. What is the purpose of the center grip when adjusting an imported model in Google Earth?
A16. The center grip allows you to move the imported model to a different location within Google Earth if it was not placed correctly during the import process.

Q17. What is the purpose of the rotation control when adjusting an imported model in Google Earth?
A17. The rotation control allows you to rotate the imported model if it is not oriented correctly within Google Earth.

Q18. What is the benefit of being able to adjust the position and orientation of an imported model in Google Earth?
A18. The ability to adjust the position and orientation of an imported model in Google Earth ensures that the model can be accurately placed and aligned with the surrounding terrain and imagery, even if there were any discrepancies during the initial import process.

Q19. What is the purpose of using satellite imagery from providers like Digital Globe in SketchUp?
A19. Using satellite imagery from providers like Digital Globe in SketchUp allows you to create geo-located models based on real-world locations and accurate terrain data.

Q20. How does the geo-location process in SketchUp differ when using Digital Globe imagery compared to Google Earth imagery?
A20. The geo-location process in SketchUp is similar when using Digital Globe imagery or Google Earth imagery, with the main difference being the provider of the satellite imagery and terrain data.

Q21. What is the advantage of being able to use different satellite imagery providers in SketchUp?
A21. The ability to use different satellite imagery providers in SketchUp allows you to access the most up-to-date and accurate data for the specific location you are modeling, as different providers may have varying levels of detail or recency for different areas.

Q22. How does the tutorial demonstrate the compatibility between SketchUp and Google Earth?
A22. The tutorial demonstrates the compatibility between SketchUp and Google Earth by showing how a geo-located model created in SketchUp using Digital Globe imagery can be successfully exported and imported into Google Earth while maintaining its accurate placement and orientation.

Q23. What is the significance of the .kmz file format in the context of this tutorial?
A23. The .kmz file format is a compressed version of the .kml file format, which is the standard format for geographic data used by Google Earth. Using the .kmz format allows the model created in SketchUp to be imported and displayed correctly in Google Earth.

Q24. What is the purpose of the zoom animation in Google Earth shown in the tutorial?
A24. The zoom animation in Google Earth shown in the tutorial is used to demonstrate the process of navigating to the approximate location where the model was geo-located in SketchUp, before importing the .kmz file.

Q25. What is the benefit of being able to view a geo-located model in Google Earth?
A25. Viewing a geo-located model in Google Earth provides a realistic and immersive visualization of the model in its intended location, allowing for better context and understanding of how the model fits within the surrounding environment and terrain.
