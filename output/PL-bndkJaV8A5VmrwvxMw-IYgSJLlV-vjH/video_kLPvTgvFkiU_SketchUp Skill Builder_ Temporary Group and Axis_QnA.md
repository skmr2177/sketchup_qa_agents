# SketchUp Skill Builder  Temporary Group and Axis - Q&A

Q1. What was the goal of the tutorial?
A1. The goal of the tutorial was to demonstrate how to use temporary groups and axis adjustments in SketchUp to create geometry that is perpendicular or aligned to specific lines or surfaces in a model.

Q2. What was the example model used in the tutorial?
A2. The example model used in the tutorial was a steam engine, where the goal was to create rods that run perpendicular from the center of two pieces up into a box, aligning with two existing lines in the model.

Q3. Why was it difficult to create the desired geometry without using temporary groups and axis adjustments?
A3. Without using temporary groups and axis adjustments, it would be difficult to create the rods perpendicular to the existing lines because the default axes in SketchUp may not align with the desired orientation. Simply drawing a circle and pushing/pulling it would result in the geometry being created in an undesired direction.

Q4. What was the first step in the process?
A4. The first step was to select the two lines that represented the desired orientation for the rods and create a group by right-clicking and selecting "Make Group".

Q5. What happened when the group was created?
A5. When the group was created, it isolated the selected geometry (the two lines) from the rest of the model, and the default axes were assigned to the lower corner of the group's bounding box.

Q6. How did the tutorial change the axis orientation within the group?
A6. To change the axis orientation within the group, the tutorial used the Axes tool. First, it clicked on the start point of one of the lines to set the origin. Then, it clicked again along the same line to align the red axis with that line. Finally, it clicked a second time without selecting a direction for the green axis, which automatically aligned the green and blue axes perpendicular to the red axis.

Q7. What tool was used to create the rod geometry?
A7. The Circle tool was used to create the rod geometry within the group, with the axis toggled to the red axis to ensure the circle was perpendicular to the line.

Q8. How was the rod geometry extended along the line?
A8. The Push/Pull tool was used to extend the circle geometry along the line, snapping to the end point of the line to ensure the rod ran the full length.

Q9. What was done after creating the rod geometry for both lines?
A9. After creating the rod geometry for both lines within the group, the group was selected and "Exploded" to bring the geometry back into the main model context.

Q10. What was the advantage of using temporary groups and axis adjustments in this scenario?
A10. The advantage of using temporary groups and axis adjustments was that it allowed the creation of geometry aligned to specific orientations without disrupting the overall model axes or coordinate system. It isolated the axis adjustments to the temporary group, keeping the rest of the model's axes unchanged.

Q11. What would happen if the world axis was adjusted instead of using a temporary group?
A11. If the world axis was adjusted instead of using a temporary group, it would change the up, down, left, and right orientation for the entire model, which could be problematic for other geometry or future modeling operations.

Q12. How did the tutorial ensure that the "Hide Rest of Model" setting was enabled within the group?
A12. The tutorial mentioned that when double-clicking to enter the group, the "Hide Rest of Model" setting was checked under the View > Component Edit menu. This setting ensured that only the group geometry was visible, making it easier to work within the isolated context.

Q13. What is the purpose of the "Explode" command used at the end?
A13. The "Explode" command was used to bring the rod geometry created within the temporary group back into the main model context. It essentially merged the group geometry with the rest of the model, allowing further modeling operations on the combined geometry.

Q14. What would happen if the "Explode" command was not used?
A14. If the "Explode" command was not used, the rod geometry would remain isolated within the temporary group, separate from the rest of the model geometry. This could make it difficult to perform further modeling operations that involve both the rod geometry and the rest of the model.

Q15. Can temporary groups be nested or created within other groups?
A15. Yes, temporary groups can be nested or created within other existing groups in SketchUp. This allows for even more localized axis adjustments and isolated modeling contexts.

Q16. What is the advantage of using temporary groups over permanently adjusting the model axes?
A16. The advantage of using temporary groups over permanently adjusting the model axes is that it keeps the overall model coordinate system intact, making it easier to maintain consistent orientation and reference points throughout the modeling process.

Q17. Can the axis adjustment process be repeated for multiple lines or surfaces within the same temporary group?
A17. Yes, the axis adjustment process demonstrated in the tutorial can be repeated for multiple lines or surfaces within the same temporary group. This allows for creating geometry aligned to various orientations within the isolated group context.

Q18. What is the significance of the "square line" mentioned when aligning the red axis?
A18. The "square line" refers to the inference line that appears when the cursor is aligned with an existing line or edge in SketchUp. This visual cue helps ensure that the red axis is being aligned precisely with the desired line or surface.

Q19. Can the temporary group be moved or repositioned within the main model after creating the desired geometry?
A19. Yes, the temporary group can be moved or repositioned within the main model after creating the desired geometry. This allows for positioning the newly created geometry in the correct location relative to the rest of the model.

Q20. What is the purpose of the "X-ray" mode mentioned in the tutorial?
A20. The "X-ray" mode was used in the tutorial to visualize the end points of the lines that represented the desired orientation for the rods. This mode allows seeing through solid geometry, making it easier to identify specific points or intersections within the model.

Q21. Can the temporary group be saved as a component for reuse in other models?
A21. Yes, the temporary group containing the adjusted axes and created geometry can be saved as a component in SketchUp. This component can then be easily inserted and reused in other models, preserving the axis orientation and geometry within the component.

Q22. What is the purpose of the "Hide Rest of Model" setting in SketchUp?
A22. The "Hide Rest of Model" setting in SketchUp is used to temporarily hide all geometry outside of the currently selected group or component. This helps focus on the specific geometry being worked on and reduces visual clutter from the rest of the model.

Q23. Can the axis adjustment process be used for creating geometry other than circles and rods?
A23. Yes, the axis adjustment process demonstrated in the tutorial can be used for creating various types of geometry, not just circles and rods. It allows for aligning and creating any geometry perpendicular or aligned to specific lines or surfaces within the temporary group context.

Q24. What is the purpose of the "Component Edit" menu in SketchUp?
A24. The "Component Edit" menu in SketchUp provides options for working with components and groups, such as hiding or showing the rest of the model, editing the component geometry, and managing component behaviors.

Q25. Can the temporary group be copied or arrayed within the main model after creating the desired geometry?
A25. Yes, the temporary group containing the created geometry can be copied or arrayed within the main model after creating the desired geometry. This allows for easily duplicating or repeating the geometry in multiple locations or patterns within the model.
