# Q&A for SketchUp Skill Builder: Exploded Model

### 1. What is the main purpose of creating an exploded view in SketchUp?

**A:** An exploded view shows all the different parts of a model separated from each other, making it easier to see how the pieces fit together. This is commonly used in furniture drawings or any model where multiple pieces assemble to create a final product, helping with assembly instructions or understanding the model's structure.

### 2. What type of model does Aaron use to demonstrate the exploded view technique?

**A:** Aaron uses a little robot model to demonstrate the exploded view technique. This model has multiple components including arms, legs, body parts, screws, nuts, and bolts that can be separated to show how they all fit together.

### 3. What is the prerequisite for creating an exploded view in SketchUp?

**A:** The prerequisite is that every piece you want to explode must be in its own component or group. If this isn't the case, you need to set up the model properly first before attempting to create an exploded view.

### 4. What are "assemblies" in the context of exploded views?

**A:** Assemblies are components made up of multiple components. In Aaron's robot model, the arms and legs are assemblies because they contain multiple pieces within them. This actually makes exploding easier because you can work with these larger assemblies first, then break them down further.

### 5. How does Aaron create a reference for consistent explosion distances?

**A:** Aaron creates a 1" by 1" by 1" cube as a reference piece. This cube helps him maintain consistent explosion distances - he knows he wants about an inch of separation between pieces, so he uses this cube as a visual guide when using the Move tool.

### 6. What is Aaron's step-by-step approach to creating an exploded view?

**A:** Aaron's approach is: 1) Start with the upper body and work down, 2) Use the Move tool to separate pieces vertically first, 3) Deselect one piece at a time and move it, 4) Work through the model systematically, 5) Move pieces horizontally as needed, 6) Handle components that repeat throughout the model.

### 7. How does Aaron handle components that repeat throughout the model?

**A:** When Aaron moves a component that repeats throughout the model (like nuts and bolts), all instances of that component move together. This saves time because he only has to move the component once, and all copies throughout the model will be moved to the same relative position.

### 8. What is the advantage of using components for exploded views?

**A:** Components allow you to move one instance and have all copies move together. This is especially useful for repeated elements like screws, nuts, and bolts - you only need to move them once, and all instances throughout the model will be positioned consistently in the exploded view.

### 9. How does Aaron handle mirrored components in the exploded view?

**A:** Aaron mentions that one arm is a mirrored copy of the other. Since they're the same component, he only needs to do the explosion work once - when he moves pieces in one arm, the mirrored arm will automatically have the same changes applied.

### 10. What camera settings does Aaron recommend for exploded views?

**A:** Aaron suggests changing from Perspective to Parallel Projection in the Camera menu. This gives a more traditional technical drawing look that's commonly used in exploded views. He also recommends turning off the axes for a cleaner appearance.

### 11. How does Aaron use the reference cube during the explosion process?

**A:** Aaron uses the 1" reference cube as a visual guide when using the Move tool. He can click from one point to another on the cube to move pieces by exactly one inch, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the exploded view.

### 12. What is the workflow for separating vertical parts in an exploded view?

**A:** The workflow for vertical separation is: 1) Select the pieces you want to move, 2) Use the Move tool, 3) Click on the reference cube to establish the movement distance, 4) Move the pieces up, 5) Deselect one piece at a time and repeat the process to create layered separation.

### 13. How does Aaron handle horizontal separation of parts?

**A:** For horizontal separation, Aaron selects individual pieces (like screws in the jaw) and uses the Move tool to move them left, right, forward, or back. He uses the same reference cube technique to maintain consistent spacing.

### 14. What is the benefit of working with assemblies in exploded views?

**A:** Working with assemblies (components made of multiple components) makes the process more efficient. You can move the entire assembly first, then drill down into it to separate individual pieces, rather than having to move every small piece individually from the start.

### 15. How does Aaron ensure all pieces are properly separated in the exploded view?

**A:** Aaron works systematically through the model, starting from the top and working down. He deselects one piece at a time and moves it, ensuring that each piece gets its own space in the exploded view. He also handles both vertical and horizontal separation as needed.

### 16. What is the advantage of using Parallel Projection for exploded views?

**A:** Parallel Projection provides a more traditional technical drawing appearance that's commonly used in exploded views. It eliminates perspective distortion, making it easier to see the relationships between parts and creating a more professional, technical documentation look.

### 17. How does Aaron handle nuts and bolts that are connected together?

**A:** Aaron shows that nuts and bolts can be components with two pieces connected together. When he moves one instance of this component, all instances throughout the model move together, saving time and ensuring consistency in the exploded view.

### 18. What is the practical application of exploded views?

**A:** Exploded views are useful for 3D printing, assembly instructions, understanding how parts fit together, and creating technical documentation. Aaron mentions that if he were to 3D print the robot, he could look at the exploded view to see where all the pieces go for assembly.

### 19. How does Aaron organize the explosion process for efficiency?

**A:** Aaron organizes the process by: 1) Starting with larger assemblies first, 2) Working systematically from top to bottom, 3) Taking advantage of components that repeat throughout the model, 4) Using a reference cube for consistent spacing, 5) Handling both vertical and horizontal separation as needed.

### 20. What is the difference between moving individual pieces and moving assemblies?

**A:** Moving assemblies (groups of components) allows you to separate larger sections first, then break them down further. Moving individual pieces gives you more precise control over the final exploded view. Aaron uses both approaches depending on the complexity of the model.

### 21. How does Aaron handle pieces that need to move in different directions?

**A:** Aaron handles different movement directions by selecting pieces individually and using the Move tool to move them in the appropriate direction (up, down, left, right, forward, back). He uses the reference cube to maintain consistent spacing regardless of direction.

### 22. What is the benefit of turning off axes in the final exploded view?

**A:** Turning off the axes creates a cleaner, more professional appearance for the exploded view. It removes visual clutter and focuses attention on the model parts and their relationships, which is the main purpose of an exploded view.

### 23. How does Aaron ensure the exploded view is clear and understandable?

**A:** Aaron ensures clarity by: 1) Maintaining consistent spacing using the reference cube, 2) Working systematically through the model, 3) Separating pieces in logical directions, 4) Using Parallel Projection for better visual representation, 5) Creating enough separation to clearly see individual parts.

### 24. What is the advantage of using the Move tool for creating exploded views?

**A:** The Move tool provides precise control over piece positioning and allows you to use reference objects (like the 1" cube) for consistent spacing. It's also the standard tool for this type of operation in SketchUp, making it familiar and reliable.

### 25. What is the overall workflow for creating a complete exploded view?

**A:** The complete workflow is: 1) Ensure all pieces are properly organized as components or groups, 2) Create a reference cube for consistent spacing, 3) Start with larger assemblies and work down to individual pieces, 4) Use the Move tool systematically to separate pieces vertically and horizontally, 5) Take advantage of components that repeat throughout the model, 6) Switch to Parallel Projection for the final view, 7) Turn off axes for a clean appearance, resulting in a clear exploded view that shows how all pieces fit together.
