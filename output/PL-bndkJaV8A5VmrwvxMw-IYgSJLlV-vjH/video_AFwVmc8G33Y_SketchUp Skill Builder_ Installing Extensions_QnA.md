# SketchUp Skill Builder  Installing Extensions - Q&A

Q1. What are the two ways to install extensions in SketchUp mentioned in the tutorial?
A1. The two ways to install extensions in SketchUp mentioned in the tutorial are:
1) Via the Extension Warehouse
2) Through the Extension Manager by installing a .rbz file

Q2. How do you access the Extension Warehouse in SketchUp?
A2. You can access the Extension Warehouse in SketchUp by clicking on the Extension Warehouse button or by going to Window > Extension Warehouse.

Q3. Why is it recommended to log in to the Extension Warehouse before installing an extension?
A3. It is recommended to log in to the Extension Warehouse before installing an extension for two reasons:
1) If you download an extension while logged in, it will be added to your "My Extensions" list, making it easier to install the same extensions on a new computer or future versions of SketchUp.
2) When logged in, you will see an "Install" button instead of a "Download" button, allowing you to install the extension directly without downloading it first.

Q4. How do you install an extension from the Extension Warehouse?
A4. To install an extension from the Extension Warehouse, search for the desired extension, click the "Install" button, and confirm the installation prompt.

Q5. How do you access the Extension Manager in SketchUp?
A5. You can access the Extension Manager in SketchUp by clicking the Extension Manager button or by going to Window > Extension Manager.

Q6. What information does the Extension Manager provide?
A6. The Extension Manager provides a list of all the extensions installed in the current copy of SketchUp.

Q7. How can you temporarily disable an installed extension in SketchUp?
A7. You can temporarily disable an installed extension in SketchUp by clicking the Enable/Disable switch for that extension in the Extension Manager and hitting "Apply Changes".

Q8. How can you permanently remove or uninstall an extension in SketchUp?
A8. You can permanently remove or uninstall an extension in SketchUp by selecting the extension in the Extension Manager, going to the "Manage" tab, and clicking the "Uninstall" button.

Q9. How can you update an installed extension in SketchUp?
A9. If an update is available for an extension installed through the Extension Warehouse, you can update it by going to the Extension Manager, selecting the extension, and clicking the "Update" button in the "Manage" tab.

Q10. How do you install an extension that is not available in the Extension Warehouse?
A10. To install an extension that is not available in the Extension Warehouse, you can go to the Extension Manager, click "Install Extension", navigate to the location of the .rbz file for the extension, select it, and click "Open".

Q11. What is the advantage of installing extensions through the Extension Warehouse compared to installing a .rbz file?
A11. The advantage of installing extensions through the Extension Warehouse is that extensions installed this way will be available for updates through the Extension Manager, while extensions installed from a .rbz file will not have automatic update availability.

Q12. What is the purpose of the "My Extensions" list in the Extension Warehouse?
A12. The "My Extensions" list in the Extension Warehouse allows you to see and easily reinstall all the extensions you have previously downloaded or installed while logged in to the Extension Warehouse.

Q13. Can you disable or uninstall extensions that were installed from a .rbz file using the Extension Manager?
A13. Yes, you can disable or uninstall extensions that were installed from a .rbz file using the Extension Manager, just like extensions installed through the Extension Warehouse.

Q14. What is the file extension for SketchUp extensions?
A14. The file extension for SketchUp extensions is .rbz.

Q15. What rights or permissions do you grant when installing an extension in SketchUp?
A15. When installing an extension in SketchUp, you grant the extension program certain rights or permissions to access and modify your computer, which is why you receive a prompt to confirm the installation.

Q16. Can you provide an example of an extension mentioned in the tutorial?
A16. Yes, the tutorial mentions installing the "Groups to Components" extension by ThomThom and the "Camera Memory" extension by Eneroth.

Q17. What is the purpose of the "Groups to Components" extension mentioned in the tutorial?

Q18. What is the purpose of the "Camera Memory" extension mentioned in the tutorial?
A18. The purpose of the "Camera Memory" extension is not explicitly stated in the tutorial, but based on its name, it likely allows you to save and recall camera positions or views within SketchUp.

Q19. Can you install multiple extensions at once in SketchUp?
A19. The tutorial does not explicitly mention installing multiple extensions at once, but it is likely possible to select and install multiple extensions from the Extension Warehouse or by selecting multiple .rbz files in the Extension Manager.

Q20. What is the benefit of using the Extension Manager to manage installed extensions?
A20. The benefit of using the Extension Manager to manage installed extensions is that it provides a centralized location to view, enable/disable, update, and uninstall all extensions installed in SketchUp.

Q21. Can you install extensions from sources other than the Extension Warehouse or .rbz files?
A21. The tutorial does not mention any other sources for installing extensions in SketchUp besides the Extension Warehouse and .rbz files.

A22. The tutorial does not mention any specific limitations or restrictions on the types of extensions that can be installed in SketchUp.

Q23. Can you install extensions in SketchUp without an internet connection?

Q24. Are there any security considerations when installing extensions in SketchUp?
A24. Yes, the tutorial mentions that when installing an extension, you are granting that program certain rights or permissions on your computer, which is why you receive a prompt to confirm the installation. This implies that there are potential security considerations when installing extensions from untrusted sources.

Q25. Can you uninstall or remove the built-in extensions that come pre-installed with SketchUp?
A25. The tutorial does not mention anything about uninstalling or removing built-in extensions that come pre-installed with SketchUp, so it is unclear if this is possible or recommended.
