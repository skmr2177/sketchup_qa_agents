# Q&A for Sketchup Skill Builder: Conceptual Template

### 1. What is the main purpose of creating a custom template for conceptual modeling?

**A:** The custom template is designed to facilitate specific types of modeling by having preset elements already configured when you first open a new model. In this case, it's set up for conceptual architectural modeling, which means having various tools, settings, and components pre-configured to speed up the conceptual design process.

### 2. What specific unit setting does Aaron configure for conceptual modeling and why?

**A:** Aaron sets the units to snap to 1' (one foot) increments. This means when drawing, all dimensions jump to the nearest foot rather than smaller, more precise increments. This is done so that when the model is finished, you'll have round numbers rather than fractions or small dimensions that aren't necessary for conceptual work.

### 3. How do you access and change the unit settings in SketchUp?

**A:** You access unit settings through Model Info. Go to Model Info, then look at the Units section. For conceptual architectural modeling, you can set the precision to a larger number and set the snapping to a bigger increment (like 1') so that as you drag your mouse while drawing, it jumps to the nearest foot rather than odd small increments.

### 4. What style setting does Aaron prefer for conceptual modeling and why?

**A:** Aaron uses a sketchy style for conceptual modeling. While this isn't absolutely necessary, he likes working in this style because it makes the drawing feel temporary and clearly indicates that this is not a final polished drawing but rather a conceptual work-in-progress.

### 5. What are the key components that Aaron includes in his conceptual template?

**A:** Aaron includes several pre-saved components that he can quickly use: windows that can be snapped into walls, doors, reference items like cars for parking areas, bushes for landscaping, and even decorative elements like a "big pink gorilla." These components are saved so he can quickly throw them in without having to model them from scratch.

### 6. How do you add layers to a template and why are they useful?

**A:** You can add layers by going to the Layers panel and creating them quickly. When you save the template, it saves all the layer information. Layers are useful because once you get items to the point where you want to group them or organize them, you can quickly assign them to appropriate layers (like "first floor") without having to create the layers from scratch each time.

### 7. What are the two main ways to add components to your template?

**A:** The two main ways are: 1) Draw the things you want (like a window), set the size, save it as a component, and it will show up in your components panel; 2) Leverage 3D Warehouse by searching for components (like windows), downloading them into your model, and they become part of your component library.

### 8. What important warning does Aaron give about the Purge function when setting up templates?

**A:** Aaron warns that you should NOT go into Model Info > Statistics and click Purge when setting up templates. Purge will delete everything that's not actually visible on the model screen, including unused components, layers, styles, and anything else not currently being used. This would remove all the components you've carefully added to your template.

### 9. How do you save a custom template in SketchUp?

**A:** To save a custom template, go to File > Save As Template. You can then name your template (Aaron calls his "Concept") and save it. You can also set "Use As Default" so that this template will be used when you start a new model.

### 10. How can you change which template is used as the default for new models?

**A:** You can change the default template by going to SketchUp > Preferences (or Windows > Preferences on Windows), where you can see all stock templates and user-created templates at the bottom. From there, you can select which template you want to use when creating a new model.

### 11. What is the difference between conceptual modeling precision and regular architectural modeling precision?

**A:** For regular architectural building modeling, you'd typically use 1/16" precision for detailed work. For conceptual modeling, you use a larger precision setting (like 1' snapping) because you're working with general ideas and round numbers rather than precise construction details.

### 12. Why does Aaron emphasize that snapping doesn't prevent drawing other dimensions?

**A:** Aaron clarifies that snapping doesn't mean you can't draw other dimensions - it just means that as you drag your mouse while drawing, it will jump to the nearest foot rather than some small, odd increment. You can still type in specific dimensions if needed.

### 13. What happens when you import components from 3D Warehouse into your template?

**A:** When you import components from 3D Warehouse, they become part of your model's component library. You don't need to have them visible on the screen - once they're loaded into the model, they're available as components even if they're not currently placed in the scene.

### 14. How does Aaron handle extra layers that get imported with 3D Warehouse components?

**A:** Aaron mentions that he sometimes gets extra layers from importing 3D Warehouse components. He simply goes into the Layers panel and deletes these unwanted layers to keep his template clean and organized.

### 15. What is the advantage of having components pre-loaded in a template?

**A:** Having pre-loaded components allows you to automatically add details and geometry that you're going to add to every building or model you create, just by dragging and dropping. This saves significant time compared to modeling these elements from scratch each time.

### 16. How does the sketchy style help with the conceptual modeling workflow?

**A:** The sketchy style helps by making it visually clear that the work is conceptual and temporary. It creates a mental framework that this is not a final polished drawing, which helps maintain the appropriate mindset for conceptual work where you're exploring ideas rather than creating finished documentation.

### 17. What is the workflow for creating a window component from scratch for a template?

**A:** To create a window component from scratch: draw the window, set the size, go through the entire process of modeling it, then save it as a component. Once saved, it will show up in your components panel and be available for future use in your template.

### 18. How does the 1' snapping setting affect the modeling process?

**A:** The 1' snapping setting means that as you draw lines or create geometry, the dimensions will automatically jump to the nearest foot increment. This results in models with round numbers and clean dimensions, which is appropriate for conceptual work where precise fractions aren't necessary.

### 19. What is the benefit of having layers pre-configured in a template?

**A:** Pre-configured layers save time because you don't have to create organizational layers from scratch each time you start a new project. You can immediately start grouping elements and assigning them to appropriate layers (like "first floor") without the setup overhead.

### 20. How does Aaron demonstrate the efficiency of using a custom template?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates efficiency by showing how quickly he can work: he can snap windows into walls, throw in doors, add reference items like cars and bushes, and immediately start organizing elements into pre-existing layers. This eliminates the repetitive setup work that would otherwise be required for each new conceptual project.

### 21. What is the difference between stock templates and user-created templates?

**A:** Stock templates are the default templates that come with SketchUp, while user-created templates are custom templates that you've saved yourself. In Preferences, you can see both types - stock templates at the top and user-created templates at the bottom of the template list.

### 22. How does the template system support different types of modeling workflows?

**A:** The template system supports different workflows by allowing you to create specialized templates for different purposes. For example, you could have a conceptual template with 1' snapping and sketchy styles, a detailed architectural template with 1/16" precision, or a furniture modeling template with specific components and settings.

### 23. What is the relationship between components and the Purge function?

**A:** Components that are loaded into your model but not currently visible on screen are considered "unused" by the Purge function. If you run Purge, these components will be deleted, which is why Aaron warns against using Purge when setting up templates - it would remove all your carefully collected components.

### 24. How does the template system improve project consistency?

**A:** Templates improve consistency by ensuring that every new project starts with the same settings, styles, components, and organizational structure. This means your conceptual models will all have the same look, feel, and available resources, creating a consistent workflow across projects.

### 25. What is the overall workflow for creating and using a conceptual template?

**A:** The workflow is: 1) Start with a new model, 2) Configure units and snapping for conceptual work, 3) Set up preferred styles, 4) Create or import necessary layers, 5) Add components (either by modeling and saving them or importing from 3D Warehouse), 6) Save as a template, 7) Set as default if desired. Then for future projects, you can immediately start modeling with all these elements pre-configured.
