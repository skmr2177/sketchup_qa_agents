# Sketchup Skill Builder  Conceptual Template - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of the conceptual template in SketchUp?
A1. The conceptual template in SketchUp is designed to facilitate conceptual architectural modeling. It comes pre-configured with settings and components that aid in quickly creating rough, conceptual designs.

Q2. What is the significance of the unit settings in the conceptual template?
A2. In the conceptual template, the unit settings are configured to snap to 1 foot increments. This ensures that as you draw, the dimensions will jump in 1-foot increments, resulting in round numbers rather than fractions or small dimensions, which is more suitable for conceptual modeling.

Q3. Why is the sketchy style used in the conceptual template?
A3. The sketchy style is used in the conceptual template to give the model a temporary, unpolished look, reinforcing the idea that this is a conceptual design and not a final, polished drawing.

Q4. What are the advantages of having pre-loaded components in the conceptual template?
A4. Having pre-loaded components in the conceptual template allows you to quickly add commonly used elements, such as windows, doors, cars, bushes, or even a giant pink gorilla, without having to model them from scratch. This saves time and facilitates rapid conceptual modeling.

Q5. How are layers set up in the conceptual template?
A5. In the conceptual template, layers are pre-created and ready for use. This allows you to quickly group and organize elements into layers, such as "first floor," as you model.

Q6. How do you create a new conceptual template in SketchUp?
A6. To create a new conceptual template in SketchUp, follow these steps:
1. Start with a new, default template.
2. Go to Model Info and adjust the unit settings to snap to a larger increment (e.g., 1 foot).
3. Change the style to a sketchy edges style (optional).
4. Add new layers for organizing your model.
5. Load pre-made components from the 3D Warehouse or create your own.
6. Save the model as a template by going to File > Save As Template.
7. Optionally, set the new template as the default in Preferences.

Q7. How do you prevent components from being purged when saving a template?
A7. To prevent components from being purged when saving a template, do not click the "Purge" button in the Model Info > Statistics dialog. Purging will delete any unused components, layers, styles, or other elements not currently visible in the model.

Q8. How do you set a custom template as the default in SketchUp?
