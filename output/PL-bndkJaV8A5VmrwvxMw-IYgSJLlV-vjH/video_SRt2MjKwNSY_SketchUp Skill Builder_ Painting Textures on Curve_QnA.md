# SketchUp Skill Builder  Painting Textures on Curve - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to teach how to apply a texture (image file) to a curved surface in SketchUp.

Q2. What is the first step before importing a texture?
A2. The first step is to get into the correct context by double-clicking into the edit mode for the component or group containing the curved surface you want to texture.

Q3. How do you reveal hidden geometry in SketchUp?
A3. To reveal hidden geometry, go to View > Hidden Geometry or use the keyboard shortcut mapped to this command.

Q4. Why is it important to reveal hidden geometry when texturing curved surfaces?
A4. Revealing hidden geometry allows you to select individual faces or polygons on the curved surface, which is necessary for properly mapping and tiling the texture across the entire curved area.

Q5. How do you import an image file as a texture in SketchUp?
A5. Go to File > Import, select the image file, and make sure the "Use As Texture" option is checked before importing.

Q6. What is the purpose of setting an anchor point when importing a texture?
A6. Setting an anchor point by clicking on the surface determines where the texture will be initially placed and oriented.

Q7. How do you apply the imported texture to additional faces on the curved surface?
A7. Use the Paint Bucket tool and the "sample material" modifier (Command/Control + click) to sample the texture from the initial face and apply it to adjacent faces.

Q8. How do you scale or reposition a texture after initially placing it?
A9. Right-click and go to Texture > Position, then use the grips (green for scaling, corners for repositioning) to adjust the size and placement of the texture.

Q10. What is a potential issue when applying a texture to a curved surface without hidden geometry revealed?
A10. If hidden geometry is not revealed, SketchUp may not properly tile the texture across the entire curved surface, resulting in visible seams or stretching.

Q11. How can you avoid seams when texturing a curved surface?
A11. To avoid seams, reveal hidden geometry and use the Paint Bucket tool with the sample material modifier to apply the texture face-by-face across the entire curved area.

Q12. What is mentioned about an upcoming tutorial related to texturing curved surfaces?
A12. The tutorial mentions that there will be another Skill Builder tutorial covering the "projected" option when adding a texture to a curved surface.

Q13. What is the recommended workflow for texturing a curved surface like a wine bottle label?
A13. The recommended workflow is: 1) Get into component edit mode, 2) Reveal hidden geometry, 3) Select the specific face for the label, 4) Import image as texture and set anchor points, 5) Use Paint Bucket tool to sample and apply texture to adjacent faces.

Q14. What is the purpose of the "All Supported Image Types" option when importing textures?
A14. Selecting "All Supported Image Types" allows you to easily import various common image file formats like JPG, PNG, etc. as textures.

Q15. What keyboard modifier is used with the Paint Bucket tool to sample a material/texture?
A15. The keyboard modifier for sampling a material/texture with the Paint Bucket tool is Command on Mac or Control on Windows.

Q16. How do you adjust the scale of a texture using the grips after positioning it?
A16. After right-clicking and selecting Texture > Position, use the green grip (scaling handle) to adjust the scale of the texture while keeping an eye on the edges to fit the geometry.

Q17. What is a potential issue when applying a large texture to a curved surface all at once?
A17. If you try to apply a large texture to a curved surface all at once without revealing hidden geometry, SketchUp may not tile it properly, resulting in visible seams.

Q18. What is the purpose of the "In Model" category in the Materials browser when texturing?
A18. The "In Model" category in the Materials browser shows any image files or textures you have already imported into the current SketchUp model.

Q19. How do you isolate a specific curved section for texturing within a larger component or group?
A19. Use the Select tool to double-click into the component or group, and then double-click again on the specific curved section you want to texture.

Q20. What is an example of a concave curved surface shown for texturing in the tutorial?
A20. An example of a concave curved surface shown for texturing is a curved interior wall section.

Q21. How does the workflow differ when texturing a concave versus convex curved surface?
A21. The overall workflow is the same, but concave surfaces may require more careful adjustment of the texture scale and position using the grips after the initial placement.

Q22. What is a potential benefit of mapping keyboard shortcuts for View > Hidden Geometry?
A22. Mapping a keyboard shortcut for View > Hidden Geometry can save time and increase efficiency when frequently texturing curved surfaces that require revealing hidden geometry.

Q23. What is the recommended technique if the texture does not tile properly after the initial application?
A23. If the texture does not tile properly after the initial application, use the Paint Bucket tool with the sample material modifier to apply the texture face-by-face across the entire curved area.

Q24. What file type is recommended for textures or image files imported into SketchUp?
A24. While various file types are supported, the tutorial recommends using common image formats like JPG for textures imported into SketchUp.

Q25. What is the purpose of setting the "Use As Texture" option when importing image files into SketchUp?
A25. Setting the "Use As Texture" option when importing an image file into SketchUp allows you to map and tile that image as a texture onto surfaces in your model.
