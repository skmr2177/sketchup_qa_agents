# SketchUp Skill Builder  Section Planes - Q&A

Q1. What is a Section Plane in SketchUp?
A1. A Section Plane is a tool in SketchUp that allows you to create a cut or slice through your 3D model to reveal the interior or cross-section. It essentially creates a 2D view of your model along the plane you define.

Q2. How do you access the Section Plane tool in SketchUp?
A2. There are two ways to access the Section Plane tool:
1) Open the Large Tool Set and click on the Section Plane icon.
2) Go to Tools > Section Plane in the menu bar.

Q3. What happens when you first activate the Section Plane tool?
A3. When you first activate the Section Plane tool, SketchUp prompts you to give the Section Plane a name and an optional symbol. This helps you identify and manage different Section Planes in your model.

Q4. How does SketchUp determine the orientation of the Section Plane?
A4. As you move your cursor around the modeling window, SketchUp changes the orientation of the Section Plane based on where you're placing the cursor. This allows you to position the plane at the desired angle or location.

Q5. Where can you see the name and symbol of a Section Plane?
A5. You can see the name and symbol of a Section Plane in the Entity Info panel when you click on the Section Plane, and also in the Outliner window.

Q6. How can you move or rotate a Section Plane?
A6. You can move a Section Plane just like any other geometry in SketchUp by using the Move tool. You can also rotate a Section Plane using the Rotate tool, which can be useful for creating angled or non-planar section cuts.

Q7. What options are available when you right-click on a Section Plane?
A7. When you right-click on a Section Plane, you have the following options:
- Erase: Deletes the Section Plane
- Hide: Hides the Section Plane from view
- Unhide: Unhides a previously hidden Section Plane
- Reverse Cut: Reverses the direction of the section cut
- Create Group from Slice: Creates a group from the geometry at the section cut
- Align View: Aligns the view perpendicular to the Section Plane
- Troubleshoot Section Fill: Helps identify issues with missing geometry affecting the section fill

Q8. How can you manage hidden Section Planes?
A8. The Outliner window is a useful tool for managing hidden Section Planes. Even when a Section Plane is hidden in the modeling window, you can still see and interact with it in the Outliner.

Q9. What is the purpose of the "Create Group from Slice" option?
A9. The "Create Group from Slice" option creates a new group containing the linework or geometry at the section cut. This can be useful for quickly extracting a 2D section view or plan from your 3D model.

Q10. How can you align the view to a Section Plane?
A10. You can align the view perpendicular to a Section Plane by right-clicking on the Section Plane and selecting "Align View". This is a convenient way to set up a scene or view for a section or plan view.

Q11. How can you troubleshoot issues with the section fill?
A11. If you're experiencing issues with missing or incomplete section fill, you can right-click on the Section Plane and select "Troubleshoot Section Fill". SketchUp will then provide visual indicators to help you identify any missing geometry that may be causing the issue.

Q12. Where can you adjust the appearance of Section Planes?
A12. You can adjust the appearance of Section Planes, such as the fill color, line color, and line width, in the Styles window (Window > Styles). These settings are style-specific, so you can have different appearances for different styles.

Q13. Can you have multiple Section Planes active at the same time?
A13. Yes, you can have multiple Section Planes active simultaneously in SketchUp. This can be useful for showing different section views or cuts through your model.

Q14. Can you place a Section Plane inside a group or component?
A14. Yes, you can place a Section Plane inside a group or component in SketchUp. This allows you to create section cuts that are specific to that group or component, rather than cutting through the entire model.

Q15. How do you create a new Section Plane inside a group or component?
A15. To create a new Section Plane inside a group or component, first open or edit the group/component, then activate the Section Plane tool and place the plane where desired within that group/component.

Q16. What is the purpose of using the Outliner with Section Planes?
A16. The Outliner is a useful tool for managing and organizing Section Planes in your SketchUp model. It allows you to easily see, select, and interact with Section Planes, even if they are hidden in the modeling window.

Q17. Can you rename a Section Plane?
A17. Yes, you can rename a Section Plane by right-clicking on it in the Outliner and selecting "Rename". This can help you better identify and organize your Section Planes.

Q18. How do you update changes made to a Section Plane style?
A18. If you make changes to the appearance of Section Planes in a particular style (e.g., changing the fill color or line width), you need to click the "Update" button in the Styles window to save those changes to that style.

Q19. Can you turn off the display of Section Planes in a particular style?
A19. Yes, in the Styles window, you can toggle off the display of Section Planes, their fill, or their lines for a specific style. This can be useful if you want to temporarily hide Section Planes or their visual elements in certain views or scenes.

Q20. What is the purpose of using scenes with Section Planes?
A20. Scenes in SketchUp can be particularly useful when working with Section Planes. You can create scenes with specific view settings, such as turning off perspective or aligning the view to a Section Plane, to create clear and organized section or plan views.
