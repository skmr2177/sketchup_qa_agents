# SketchUp Skill Builder  Drawing a 2D Figure - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to draw a 2D figure in SketchUp using an image as a reference.

Q2. What is the first step mentioned in the tutorial?
A2. The first step mentioned is to zoom in on the reference image and start placing lines to trace around a portion of the image that you want to make into a surface.

Q3. How does the instructor recommend placing lines to trace the image?
A3. The instructor recommends clicking every couple of inches to place lines, and mentions that it doesn't have to be exact.

Q4. What issue does the instructor encounter when trying to draw lines off-axis?
A4. The instructor mentions that the further out he is from the center, the harder SketchUp's inferencing tries to pull the lines towards an axis. To overcome this, he zooms in a little to allow drawing lines off-axis.

Q5. What is the significance of the color of the dot beneath the pencil cursor?
A5. The instructor emphasizes the importance of watching the color of the dot beneath the pencil cursor. A purple dot means the cursor is on the face of the image, which is important to ensure the lines are being drawn on the correct plane.

Q6. What happens when the instructor clicks off the plane while drawing a line?
A6. When the instructor clicks off the plane while drawing a line, the line shoots off the plane, creating an undesirable geometry.

Q7. How does the instructor fix the issue of a surface not being created after drawing a closed shape?
A7. To fix the issue of a surface not being created after drawing a closed shape, the instructor spins the view sideways to check if any lines are shooting off-axis. If not, he draws some internal lines within the closed shape, which encourages SketchUp to find and create the surface.

Q8. What does the instructor do to correct surfaces that are facing the wrong direction?
A8. To correct surfaces that are facing the wrong direction, the instructor right-clicks on those surfaces and selects "Reverse Faces."

Q9. How does the instructor add color to the drawn surfaces?
A9. The instructor uses the Eyedropper tool to pick colors from the original photo and the Paint Bucket tool to fill in each surface with the desired color.

Q10. What is the final step mentioned in the tutorial?
A10. The final step mentioned is to make the drawn figure into a component and set it to always face the camera.

Q11. What tool does the instructor use to trace the reference image?
A11. The instructor uses the Line tool to trace around the reference image.

Q12. How does the instructor handle closed shapes that do not automatically generate surfaces?
A12. If a closed shape does not automatically generate a surface, the instructor draws internal lines within the closed shape to encourage SketchUp to find and create the surface.

Q13. What is the purpose of reversing faces on some surfaces?
A13. The purpose of reversing faces on some surfaces is to correct the direction in which those surfaces are facing, ensuring that they are facing the correct way.

Q14. What tools does the instructor use to add color to the drawn surfaces?
A14. The instructor uses the Eyedropper tool to pick colors from the reference image and the Paint Bucket tool to fill in the drawn surfaces with those colors.

Q15. What is the final goal of the tutorial?
A15. The final goal of the tutorial is to create a 2D figure representation of the instructor's face using the reference image, and then make it into a component that will always face the camera.

Q16. What is the importance of zooming in and out while drawing lines?
A16. Zooming in and out helps to overcome SketchUp's inferencing, which tries to pull lines towards an axis when drawing further away from the center. Zooming in allows for more precise line placement off-axis.

Q17. How does the instructor handle adding details like the ear to the drawn figure?
A17. To add details like the ear, the instructor simply places additional lines within the overall shape, creating smaller enclosed areas that will become separate surfaces.

Q18. What is the purpose of making the drawn figure into a component?
A18. Making the drawn figure into a component allows it to be easily reused and manipulated as a single entity within the SketchUp model.

Q19. What does the instructor mean by "always face the camera" when referring to the component?
A19. "Always face the camera" refers to a setting in SketchUp that ensures the component will always orient itself towards the camera's viewpoint, regardless of the camera's position or angle.

Q20. What is the significance of using the reference image in this tutorial?
A20. The reference image serves as a guide for accurately tracing and recreating the desired figure (in this case, the instructor's face) within SketchUp.

Q21. What is the purpose of drawing internal lines within a closed shape?
A21. Drawing internal lines within a closed shape helps SketchUp recognize and generate the enclosed surface when it fails to do so automatically.

Q22. What is the benefit of using the Paint Bucket tool to fill in surfaces?
A22. The Paint Bucket tool allows for quickly and easily filling in surfaces with a desired color, rather than having to apply materials or textures individually to each surface.

Q23. What is the significance of the instructor mentioning "every couple of inches" when placing lines?
A23. Mentioning "every couple of inches" suggests that the lines do not need to be placed extremely close together or with high precision, as the goal is to capture the overall shape rather than exact details.

Q24. What is the purpose of spinning the view sideways when checking for off-axis lines?
A24. Spinning the view sideways helps to clearly identify any lines that may have been inadvertently drawn off the desired plane, which can cause issues with surface generation.

Q25. What is the benefit of using the Eyedropper tool to pick colors from the reference image?
A25. Using the Eyedropper tool to pick colors from the reference image ensures that the colors used in the SketchUp model accurately match the colors in the original image, resulting in a more faithful representation.
