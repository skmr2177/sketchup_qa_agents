# When a Face Won't Close - Skill Builder - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to explain different reasons why a set of lines may not close and form a face in SketchUp, and provide solutions to fix these issues.

Q2. How many different scenarios are covered in the tutorial for when a face won't close?
A2. The tutorial covers six different scenarios where a set of lines won't close and form a face, plus an additional example of what should happen when lines close correctly.

Q3. What is the first scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A3. The first scenario is when there is a gap in the lines, preventing them from closing. This can be resolved by identifying the gap, which is usually visible at the corners, and connecting the lines properly to close the shape.

Q4. What is the second scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A4. The second scenario is when there is loose geometry coming into the plane, preventing the lines from forming a closed shape. This can be resolved by identifying and removing any lines that come into the plane but don't go back out, leaving only the closed shape.

Q5. How can you check for loose geometry in SketchUp?
A5. You can check for loose geometry by performing a group select (selecting multiple entities at once). If there is loose geometry, it will show up in the Entity Info window, and you can identify and remove it.

Q6. What is the third scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A6. The third scenario is when there is hidden geometry interfering with the lines, preventing them from closing. This can be resolved by turning on the "Hidden Geometry" view in SketchUp, identifying and deleting any hidden lines that are causing interference.

Q7. What is the fourth scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A7. The fourth scenario is when one or more of the lines are slightly out of plane, preventing them from closing. This can be resolved by identifying the out-of-plane lines, checking their coordinates, and moving them to the correct plane using the Move tool.

Q8. How can you check if a line is out of plane in SketchUp?
A8. You can check if a line is out of plane by inspecting the coordinates (x, y, z) of each endpoint. If one endpoint has a different z-coordinate (height) than the others, it indicates that the line is out of plane.

Q9. What is the fifth scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A9. The fifth scenario is when there is geometry on a hidden tag interfering with the lines, preventing them from closing. This can be resolved by turning on the "Hidden Tags" view in SketchUp, identifying and deleting any geometry on hidden tags that is causing interference.

Q10. What is the sixth scenario covered, and how can it be resolved?
A10. The sixth scenario is when the lines are part of a group or component, preventing them from closing with external lines. This can be resolved by either exploding the group/component or double-clicking to enter the group/component and drawing the closing line within it.

Q11. What is the recommended way to check for hidden geometry or tags that may be interfering with lines closing?
A11. The recommended way is to first turn on the "Hidden Geometry" view and check for any hidden lines that may be causing interference. If that doesn't reveal the issue, then turn on the "Hidden Tags" view and check for any geometry on hidden tags that may be interfering.

Q12. What is the significance of a broken line when trying to close a set of lines?
A12. A broken line is usually an indicator that there may be hidden geometry or other issues preventing the lines from closing properly.

Q13. How can you check if a set of lines is part of a group or component?
A13. You can check if a set of lines is part of a group or component by selecting one of the lines. If the entire set of lines highlights and the Entity Info window shows that it is a group, then the lines are part of a group or component.

Q14. What is the recommended workflow if you encounter a situation where a face won't close due to one of the scenarios covered in the tutorial?
A14. The recommended workflow is to first identify which scenario is causing the issue (gap in lines, loose geometry, hidden geometry, out of plane lines, hidden tags, or grouped/component lines). Then, follow the specific solution provided for that scenario to resolve the issue and allow the face to close properly.

Q15. What is the importance of being able to close a set of lines and form a face in SketchUp?
A15. Being able to close a set of lines and form a face is crucial in SketchUp for creating solid geometry, performing boolean operations, and accurately representing 3D objects and shapes.

Q16. What is the recommended way to learn more about resolving issues in SketchUp?
A16. The recommended way is to subscribe to the tutorial channel, like and comment on the videos, and provide feedback on what other topics or issues you would like to see covered in future tutorials.

Q17. What is the purpose of the "Hidden Geometry" view in SketchUp?
A17. The "Hidden Geometry" view in SketchUp allows you to see any geometry that has been hidden, which can be useful for identifying and resolving issues where hidden geometry may be interfering with other operations.

Q18. What is the purpose of the "Hidden Tags" view in SketchUp?
A18. The "Hidden Tags" view in SketchUp allows you to see any geometry that has been placed on a hidden tag, which can be useful for identifying and resolving issues where geometry on hidden tags may be interfering with other operations.

Q19. What is the significance of the "Entity Info" window in SketchUp?
A19. The "Entity Info" window in SketchUp provides information about the selected entities, such as the number of edges, faces, or components. This information can be useful for identifying issues like loose geometry or broken lines that may be preventing faces from closing.

Q20. What is the purpose of the "Group Select" tool in SketchUp?
A20. The "Group Select" tool in SketchUp allows you to select multiple entities at once, which can be useful for identifying and resolving issues like loose geometry or broken lines that may be preventing faces from closing.

Q21. What is the recommended way to check if a line is part of a group or component in SketchUp?
A21. The recommended way is to select the line and check the "Entity Info" window. If the line is part of a group or component, the "Entity Info" window will indicate that, and you may need to explode the group/component or work within it to resolve any issues with closing faces.

Q22. What is the significance of the "Explode" command in SketchUp?
A22. The "Explode" command in SketchUp allows you to break apart a group or component into its individual entities, which can be useful for resolving issues where grouped or component geometry is preventing faces from closing properly.

Q23. What is the purpose of the "Move" tool in SketchUp?
A23. The "Move" tool in SketchUp allows you to move entities or points to different locations, which can be useful for resolving issues where lines are out of plane and preventing faces from closing properly.

Q24. What is the recommended way to check if a line is out of plane in SketchUp?
A24. The recommended way is to inspect the coordinates (x, y, z) of each endpoint of the line. If one endpoint has a different z-coordinate (height) than the others, it indicates that the line is out of plane.

Q25. What is the significance of the "Stitching" technique mentioned in the tutorial?
A25. The "Stitching" technique involves temporarily connecting corners or endpoints of lines to check if they can form a closed face. If the stitching line closes the face, it indicates that one or more of the original lines may be out of plane, and the stitching line can help identify which line needs to be adjusted.
