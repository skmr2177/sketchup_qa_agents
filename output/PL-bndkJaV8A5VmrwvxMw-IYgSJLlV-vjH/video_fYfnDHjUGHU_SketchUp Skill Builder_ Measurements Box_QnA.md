# SketchUp Skill Builder  Measurements Box - Q&A

Q1. What is the Measurements Box in SketchUp?
A1. The Measurements Box is a small box located in the lower right corner of the SketchUp interface. It displays measurements and allows you to enter precise values for various operations and commands.

Q2. What was the Measurements Box previously called?
A2. The Measurements Box was previously called the Value Control Box (VCB). Some experienced SketchUp users may still refer to it by this older name.

Q3. How does the Measurements Box change its name?
A3. The Measurements Box changes its name based on the command or tool you are using. For example, when using the Line tool, it will display "Length," and when using the Rotate tool, it will display "Angle."

Q4. How do you enter values in the Measurements Box?
A4. To enter values in the Measurements Box, you don't need to click inside it. Instead, you can start typing while your cursor is anywhere on the SketchUp canvas, and the value will be entered in the Measurements Box if the current command accepts measurement input.

Q5. Can you change the units of measurement in the Measurements Box?
A5. Yes, you can change the units of measurement by typing the desired unit after the value. For example, typing "100mm" and pressing Enter will draw a line with a length of 100 millimeters.

Q6. Can you edit measurements after creating an entity?
A6. Yes, you can edit measurements after creating an entity as long as you remain in the same command. For example, if you draw a line and want to change its length, you can type the new value in the Measurements Box and press Enter.

Q7. How do you enter dimensions for a rectangle?
A7. To enter dimensions for a rectangle, you type two values separated by a comma (,) for U.S. keyboards or a semicolon (;) for other keyboards. The first value represents the width, and the second value represents the height.

Q8. How do you specify the number of sides for a polygon or circle?
A8. When using the Polygon or Circle tool, you can type the desired number of sides in the Measurements Box and press Enter to create a polygon or circle with that number of sides.

Q9. How do you create an array using the Measurements Box?
A9. To create an array using the Measurements Box, you can use the Move tool with the Copy modifier key and type "/number" or "xnumber" to create an array with the specified number of copies.

Q10. How do you change the field of view using the Measurements Box?
A10. To change the field of view using the Measurements Box, activate the Field of View command and type the desired field of view value in the Measurements Box, then press Enter.

Q11. How do you draw a line to a specific coordinate using the Measurements Box?
A11. To draw a line to a specific coordinate, you can type the coordinate values in the Measurements Box using square brackets. For example, typing "[0,0,0]" and pressing Enter will draw a line to the origin (0,0,0).

Q12. What is the purpose of the Measurements Box in SketchUp?
A12. The Measurements Box serves as a convenient way to enter precise measurements and values for various operations and commands in SketchUp, allowing for greater accuracy and control over your modeling.

Q13. Can you use the Measurements Box for operations other than drawing and editing entities?
A13. Yes, the Measurements Box can be used for various operations beyond drawing and editing entities, such as changing the field of view, creating arrays, and specifying coordinates.

Q14. Does the Measurements Box work with all tools and commands in SketchUp?
A14. The Measurements Box works with most tools and commands in SketchUp that accept measurement input, but its functionality may vary depending on the specific tool or command being used.

Q15. Can you use the Measurements Box to enter values in different units simultaneously?
A15. Yes, you can enter values in different units simultaneously by typing the unit after the value. For example, you can enter "12in" for inches and then "300mm" for millimeters without changing any settings.

Q16. How do you exit the Measurements Box after entering a value?
A16. You don't need to explicitly exit the Measurements Box after entering a value. Simply press Enter to accept the value, and the Measurements Box will remain active for the current command or tool.

Q17. Can you use the Measurements Box to enter negative values?
A17. Yes, you can enter negative values in the Measurements Box by typing the minus sign (-) before the value.

Q18. Does the Measurements Box support mathematical operations?
A18. Yes, the Measurements Box supports basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can enter expressions like "10+5" or "20/2" to perform calculations.

Q19. How does the Measurements Box handle decimal values?
A19. The Measurements Box accepts decimal values, and you can enter them directly by typing the decimal point (.) followed by the decimal digits. For example, "3.14" will be interpreted as a decimal value.

Q20. Can you use the Measurements Box to enter values in different coordinate systems?
A20. Yes, you can enter values in different coordinate systems by using the appropriate syntax. For example, to enter a value in polar coordinates, you can use the "@" symbol followed by the angle and distance.

Q21. Does the Measurements Box support keyboard shortcuts?
A21. Yes, the Measurements Box supports various keyboard shortcuts for common operations, such as pressing the up or down arrow keys to increment or decrement the value.

Q22. Can you customize the appearance or behavior of the Measurements Box?
A22. SketchUp does not provide built-in options to customize the appearance or behavior of the Measurements Box. However, some third-party extensions or plugins may offer additional customization options.

Q23. How does the Measurements Box handle units conversion?
A23. The Measurements Box automatically converts entered values to the default units set in the SketchUp model. However, you can also enter values in different units, and SketchUp will convert them accordingly.

Q24. Can you use the Measurements Box to enter values for multiple entities simultaneously?
A24. No, the Measurements Box only applies to the currently selected or active entity. To enter values for multiple entities, you would need to repeat the process for each entity individually.

Q25. Does the Measurements Box support input from external devices or data sources?
A25. The Measurements Box primarily accepts input from the keyboard. However, some third-party extensions or plugins may allow integration with external devices or data sources for input into the Measurements Box.
