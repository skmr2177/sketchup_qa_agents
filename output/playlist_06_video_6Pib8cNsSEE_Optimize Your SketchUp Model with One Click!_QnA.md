## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to extract Q&A pairs from the given text. Q&A pairs typically consist of a question and an answer.

## Step 2: Identify Q&A pairs in the text
After analyzing the text, we can identify the following Q&A pairs:
- What does Cleanup do?
  - It gets rid of extra lines, hidden geometry, and puts everything on layer zero.
- Can I undo the effects of Cleanup if I'm not satisfied?
  - No, it's a one-way process. You can try to undo by selecting everything except the component and running Cleanup again, but it's not guaranteed to work.
- Is Cleanup useful for users who design and make things without thinking about how they will be used in the future?
  - Yes, it helps get rid of extra lines and hidden geometry that can clutter a model.

## Step 3: Create Q&A pairs format
To follow the format requested, we need to format the identified Q&A pairs as "Q: Answer".

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$
