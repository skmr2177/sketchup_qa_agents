# SketchUp Extension Inspection  Mini Extension Extr - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of the Weld extension in SketchUp?
A1. The Weld extension is used to combine multiple separate lines, arcs, or segments into a single continuous curve or path. It takes a bunch of separate pieces and turns them into one unified line or curve with a single button click.

Q2. How does the Weld extension help with Follow Me operations?
A2. When creating paths for Follow Me operations, users often draw multiple lines and arcs to create the desired path shape. The Weld extension can combine all these separate pieces into a single continuous curve, ensuring that the Follow Me operation works smoothly without any disconnected segments.

Q3. How does the Weld extension help with circles?
A3. Initially, circles in SketchUp are drawn as a single line filled with a surface. However, due to intersecting geometry or exploding the curve, circles can sometimes break into multiple segments. The Weld extension can select all these separate line segments and combine them back into a single continuous curve, allowing operations like Push/Pull to work correctly.

Q4. What is the Pushline extension in SketchUp?
A4. The Pushline extension is a utility that creates a Push/Pull-like command for lines. It allows users to select a line and "pull" it, creating a surface extruded from that line.

Q5. What is the advantage of using the Pushline extension?
A5. The Pushline extension is particularly useful when starting with a single-dimensional line or shape that needs to be extruded into a surface. It provides a quick and easy way to create surfaces from lines, similar to the Push/Pull tool but specifically designed for lines.

Q6. What is the Solar North extension in SketchUp?
A6. The Solar North extension is a tool provided by the SketchUp team that helps users visualize and adjust the direction of North in their SketchUp models.

Q7. What does the Solar North extension do?
A7. The Solar North extension has two main functions:
1. It can display an orange line indicating the current direction of North in the model.
2. It allows users to click and drag to change the direction of North, pivoting the model's orientation without having to rotate or reset the entire model.

Q8. Why is it important to know the direction of North in a SketchUp model?
A8. Knowing the direction of North in a SketchUp model is important because it affects the way shadows and lighting are calculated and displayed in the model. By default, SketchUp assumes that the green axis is pointing North, but this may not always be accurate, especially if the model is geo-located or obtained from another source.

Q9. How can the Solar North extension be useful when working with models from other sources?
A9. When working with models obtained from other sources, the direction of North may not be immediately apparent. The Solar North extension can be used to toggle the orange line and visualize the current North direction in the model. This can help users understand the model's orientation and make necessary adjustments if needed.

Q10. Where can users find the Weld, Pushline, and Solar North extensions?
A10. All three extensions (Weld, Pushline, and Solar North) are available on the SketchUp Extension Warehouse, which is an online repository of extensions created by the SketchUp team and third-party developers.

Q11. What is the purpose of numbering the questions sequentially in the Q&A format?
