# SketchUp Extension Inspection  Round Corner - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of the RoundCorner extension in SketchUp?
A1. The RoundCorner extension by Fredo6 allows you to smooth out corners and edges in SketchUp geometry, making them rounded or softened instead of sharp.

Q2. Where can you find and download the RoundCorner extension?
A2. The RoundCorner extension is available for download from the SketchUp Extension Warehouse. You will also need to download and install Fredo's library called LibFredo, as it is a required dependency for RoundCorner.

Q3. How do you use the RoundCorner extension?
A3. To use RoundCorner, first select the lines or edges you want to round off. Then, click one of the three buttons in the RoundCorner toolbar. This will bring up Fredo's user interface (UI) where you can set options like the offset distance and number of segments for the rounded corners.

Q4. What are the three different button options in the RoundCorner toolbar?
A4. The three button options in the RoundCorner toolbar are:
1) Rounded corners with rounded edges
2) Rounded corners with pointed edges
3) Cut-off corners at a 45-degree angle

Q5. What is the purpose of the "offset" setting in the RoundCorner UI?
A5. The "offset" setting in the RoundCorner UI determines how far the rounded corners will be pushed back from the original corner point.

Q6. What does the "segments" setting in the RoundCorner UI control?
A6. The "segments" setting in the RoundCorner UI controls how many individual segments or faces will be used to create the rounded corner or edge.

Q7. Can RoundCorner handle both inside and outside corners?
A7. Yes, RoundCorner can round off both inside and outside corners of geometry.

Q8. What happens when you turn on "hidden geometry" after using RoundCorner?
A8. Turning on hidden geometry after using RoundCorner will reveal the additional geometry that was created to smooth out the corners and edges, showing the individual segments or faces used to create the rounded shapes.

Q9. What is a benefit of using the RoundCorner extension?
A9. A benefit of using the RoundCorner extension is that it allows you to easily round off multiple corners and edges at once, across various pieces of geometry, with just a few clicks.

Q10. How does RoundCorner handle potential issues with overlapping or odd geometry?
A10. RoundCorner will flag any potential issues if the rounded parts are going to overlap or create odd geometry, alerting the user before applying the changes.

Q11. Is the RoundCorner extension free to use?
A11. Yes, the RoundCorner extension by Fredo6 is a free extension available on the SketchUp Extension Warehouse.

Q12. What is the purpose of the LibFredo library that needs to be installed along with RoundCorner?
A12. The LibFredo library is a required dependency for the RoundCorner extension, providing additional functionality and support for the extension to work properly.

Q13. Can you provide an example of how to use the RoundCorner extension?
A13. Sure, here's an example: Let's say you have a cube in SketchUp and you want to round off all the corners. First, select all the edges or lines that make up the corners you want to round. Then, click the first button in the RoundCorner toolbar (for rounded corners with rounded edges). In the RoundCorner UI, set the offset distance (e.g., 1 inch) and the number of segments (e.g., 5). Click "Run" and RoundCorner will apply the rounded corners to your cube based on the settings you provided.

Q14. What is the difference between the first and second button options in the RoundCorner toolbar?
A14. The first button option in the RoundCorner toolbar creates rounded corners with rounded edges, while the second button option creates rounded corners but with pointed edges sticking out from the corners.

Q15. What is the purpose of the third button option in the RoundCorner toolbar?
A15. The third button option in the RoundCorner toolbar is not for creating rounded corners, but rather for cutting off corners at a 45-degree angle, merging the two planes that meet at that corner.

Q16. Can you use the RoundCorner extension on a single edge or corner, or does it require multiple edges/corners to be selected?
A16. You can use the RoundCorner extension on a single edge or corner, or you can select multiple edges and corners to round off at once.

Q17. Does the RoundCorner extension work on curved geometry, or is it limited to straight edges and corners?
A17. The tutorial does not specifically mention whether RoundCorner works on curved geometry or not, but based on the examples shown, it appears to be designed primarily for rounding off straight edges and corners.

Q18. Can you undo or reverse the changes made by the RoundCorner extension?
A18. The tutorial does not explicitly mention the ability to undo or reverse the changes made by RoundCorner, but like most SketchUp operations, it is likely that you can undo the changes using the standard undo functionality in SketchUp.

Q19. Is there a way to adjust or fine-tune the rounded corners created by RoundCorner after applying them?
A19. The tutorial does not mention any specific ways to adjust or fine-tune the rounded corners after they have been created by RoundCorner. However, it is possible that you could use other SketchUp tools and techniques to modify the geometry further if needed.

Q20. Can you use the RoundCorner extension on imported geometry or models, or is it limited to geometry created within SketchUp?
A20. The tutorial does not specify any limitations on the type of geometry that RoundCorner can be used on, so it is likely that you can use it on both geometry created within SketchUp as well as imported models or geometry from other sources.

Q21. Does the RoundCorner extension work with SketchUp's native geometry tools, such as the Push/Pull or Follow Me tools?
A21. The tutorial does not explicitly mention how RoundCorner interacts with SketchUp's native geometry tools, but it is reasonable to assume that it should work with geometry created or modified using those tools, as long as the edges and corners are selectable.

Q22. Can you use the RoundCorner extension in combination with other SketchUp extensions or plugins?
A22. The tutorial does not discuss using RoundCorner in combination with other extensions or plugins, but in general, SketchUp extensions can be used together as long as they are compatible and do not conflict with each other's functionality.

Q23. Are there any limitations or restrictions on the complexity of geometry that can be processed by the RoundCorner extension?
A23. The tutorial does not mention any specific limitations or restrictions on the complexity of geometry that RoundCorner can handle, but it is possible that very complex models with a large number of edges and corners could potentially cause performance issues or limitations.

Q24. Can you apply different rounding settings or options to different parts of the same model using the RoundCorner extension?
A24. The tutorial does not cover this scenario specifically, but it is likely that you could apply different rounding settings to different parts of a model by selecting the desired edges or corners separately and running RoundCorner with different options for each selection.

Q25. Is there a way to save or store specific rounding settings within the RoundCorner extension for future use?
A25. The tutorial does not mention any functionality for saving or storing specific rounding settings within the RoundCorner extension itself. However, you could potentially document or note down the settings you used for future reference.
