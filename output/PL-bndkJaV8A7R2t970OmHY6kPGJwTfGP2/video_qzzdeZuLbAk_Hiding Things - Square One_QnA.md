# Hiding Things - Square One - Q&A

Q1. What are the different ways to hide things in SketchUp?
A1. SketchUp offers several commands and methods to hide things from view, including:
- The Hide command (accessible via right-click or Edit menu)
- Hiding through Entity Info or the Outliner
- Using Tags to toggle visibility

Q2. When is it appropriate to use the Hide command?
A2. The Hide command is best used temporarily, for a step or two. For example, if you want to quickly see inside a box, you can hide the box faces, take a look, and then use the Unhide Last command to bring them back. However, it's not recommended for long-term hiding as it's easy to lose track of hidden geometry.

Q3. What is the recommended way to hide things in SketchUp?
A3. The recommended way to hide things is to either use Tags or the Outliner. Both of these methods allow you to toggle the visibility of groups or components, making it easier to manage and unhide them later.

Q4. How do you use the Outliner to hide and unhide geometry?
A4. In the Outliner window, you'll see a list of all the groups and components in your model. Each item has a small eyeball icon next to it. Clicking this icon will toggle the visibility of that group or component, allowing you to hide or unhide it easily.

Q5. Why might loose geometry not show up in the Outliner?
A5. Loose geometry (geometry that is not part of a group or component) typically won't show up in the Outliner. This is because loose geometry should be avoided in SketchUp models, as it's better practice to organize your geometry into groups or components.

Q6. How do you use Tags to hide and unhide geometry?
A6. To use Tags for hiding geometry, first create a new Tag (e.g., "Hide Me"). Then, select the geometry you want to hide and assign it to that Tag. You can then toggle the visibility of that Tag on and off, hiding or showing all the geometry assigned to it.

Q7. What is the biggest problem people face when hiding geometry in SketchUp?
A7. The biggest problem people face, especially when starting with SketchUp, is hiding geometry and then being unable to find or unhide it later. This can happen when using the Hide command without proper organization or tracking.

Q8. How do you view hidden geometry in SketchUp?
A8. To view hidden geometry in SketchUp, go to the View menu and select "Hidden Geometry." This will display any hidden faces, edges, or softened/smoothed lines in your model.

Q9. How do you view hidden objects (groups or components) in SketchUp?
A9. To view hidden objects (groups or components) in SketchUp, go to the View menu and select "Hidden Objects." This will display any hidden groups or components in your model.

Q10. How do you unhide individual pieces of hidden geometry?
A10. To unhide individual pieces of hidden geometry, first turn on "Hidden Geometry" from the View menu. Then, you can select the hidden faces or edges you want to unhide and use the "Unhide" command (accessible via right-click or the Edit menu).

Q11. What is the limitation of the "Unhide All" command in SketchUp?
A11. The "Unhide All" command in SketchUp only unhides geometry or objects at the current context level. If you have nested groups or components with hidden geometry inside them, "Unhide All" will not reveal that nested hidden geometry unless you navigate into that specific group or component first.

Q12. What is the recommended practice for organizing geometry in SketchUp?
A12. The recommended practice is to organize your geometry into groups or components as soon as possible, rather than leaving it as loose geometry. This makes it easier to manage visibility, apply materials, and make edits later on.

Q13. How do you create a new group or component in SketchUp?
A13. To create a new group, select the geometry you want to group and use the "Make Group" command (accessible via right-click or the Edit menu). To create a new component, select the geometry and use the "Make Component" command instead.

Q14. What is the difference between a group and a component in SketchUp?
A14. A group is a simple collection of geometry that can be edited as a single unit, but its contents are still accessible and editable. A component, on the other hand, is a more rigid entity that behaves like a single object, with its contents being less accessible for editing.

Q15. Can you nest groups or components within each other in SketchUp?
A15. Yes, you can nest groups or components within each other in SketchUp. This can be useful for organizing your model hierarchically, but it also means that you need to be careful when hiding or unhiding nested geometry, as the "Unhide All" command may not work as expected.

Q16. What is the purpose of the "Entity Info" window in SketchUp?
A16. The "Entity Info" window in SketchUp provides detailed information about the selected entity (face, edge, group, component, etc.). It also allows you to toggle the visibility of that entity by clicking the eyeball icon next to it.

Q17. How do you assign geometry to a Tag in SketchUp?
A17. To assign geometry to a Tag in SketchUp, first select the geometry you want to tag. Then, in the Tags window, either create a new Tag or select an existing one. Click the "Assign" button to assign the selected geometry to that Tag.

Q18. What is the advantage of using Tags for visibility management in SketchUp?
A18. The advantage of using Tags for visibility management is that you can easily toggle the visibility of multiple groups or components at once, simply by turning the Tag on or off. This can be especially useful when working with complex models with many different elements.

Q19. Can you assign the same geometry to multiple Tags in SketchUp?
A19. Yes, you can assign the same geometry to multiple Tags in SketchUp. This can be useful if you want to organize and manage visibility based on different criteria or categories.

Q20. What is the recommended workflow for hiding and unhiding geometry in SketchUp?
A20. The recommended workflow for hiding and unhiding geometry in SketchUp is:
1. Organize your geometry into groups or components as you create them.
2. Use the Outliner or Tags to toggle the visibility of these groups or components as needed.
3. Avoid using the Hide command for long-term hiding, as it can be easy to lose track of hidden geometry.
4. If you need to temporarily hide geometry, use the Hide command, but remember to unhide it promptly.
5. Use the "Hidden Geometry" and "Hidden Objects" options in the View menu to locate and unhide any hidden elements.

Q21. What is the purpose of the "Explode" command in SketchUp?
A21. The "Explode" command in SketchUp is used to break a group or component down into its individual components (faces, edges, etc.). This can be useful if you need to edit or modify the individual parts of a group or component.

Q22. Can you hide or unhide individual faces or edges within a group or component in SketchUp?
A22. Yes, you can hide or unhide individual faces or edges within a group or component in SketchUp. To do this, you need to first turn on "Hidden Geometry" from the View menu, then select the specific faces or edges you want to hide or unhide, and use the appropriate command.

Q23. What is the purpose of the "Soften" and "Smooth" commands in SketchUp?
A23. The "Soften" and "Smooth" commands in SketchUp are used to create curved or rounded edges and surfaces from sharp, straight geometry. These commands can be useful for creating more organic or realistic shapes, but they also create hidden geometry that may need to be managed.

Q24. How do you access the "Hidden Geometry" and "Hidden Objects" options in SketchUp?
A24. The "Hidden Geometry" and "Hidden Objects" options are both accessible from the View menu in SketchUp. You can toggle them on or off to show or hide hidden geometry and objects, respectively.

Q25. What is the recommended practice for managing hidden geometry in complex SketchUp models?
A25. In complex SketchUp models with a lot of geometry, the recommended practice for managing hidden geometry is:
1. Organize your model using groups and components as much as possible.
2. Use the Outliner or Tags to toggle visibility of these groups and components.
3. Regularly check for and unhide any hidden geometry or objects using the View menu options.
4. Avoid using the Hide command for long-term hiding, as it can lead to lost or hard-to-find hidden geometry.
5. If you need to temporarily hide geometry, use the Hide command, but remember to unhide it promptly.
