## Q&A #2

**Question:** 2. How does Aaron approach the initial setup for modeling the wine glass?

**Answer:** Aaron starts by modeling **large scale** and plans to scale it down afterwards. He explains that this will be a **radial follow me** operation (like a lathed object that spins around the middle). Aaron prefers to work at the origin point because "by starting at the origin, I know one point" making it easy to find the middle point for the radial operation. He draws a rectangle coming off the origin point and notes that while he could have used the rectangle tool, he just started drawing lines out of "muscle memory." Aaron also removes Tom (the scale figure) since he doesn't need it for this modeling exercise.
