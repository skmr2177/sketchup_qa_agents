**Question:** 16. What workflow tips does the instructor share for low-poly modeling?

**Answer:** The instructor emphasizes several low-poly workflow tips: use **polygons instead of circles** for faceted looks, **reduce segments** using option-minus in the freehand tool, **group geometry early** to avoid loose geometry, and **use guides** for precise alignment. He notes that the low-poly aesthetic requires keeping geometry simple and clean. He also emphasizes working from the origin point and using consistent modifier keys throughout the process. The instructor shows that low-poly modeling can still achieve realistic results with proper technique.
