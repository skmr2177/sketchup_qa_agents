**Question:** 3. How do I create the cup's cylindrical shape?

**Answer:** **Answer:** To create the cylindrical shape:
- **Push/Pull the base**: Extrude the bottom circle upward
- **Create offset levels**: Use offset tool to create different diameter levels
- **Build in sections**: Create the base, middle, and top sections separately
- **Add height**: Extrude to about 3.5 inches for a typical coffee cup
- **Maintain proportions**: Keep the cup shape realistic

✅ **Method**: Base circle → Push/pull → Offset → Push/pull → Continue building height.
