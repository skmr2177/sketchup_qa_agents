## Q&A #16

**Question:** 16. What if my handle doesn't align properly with the cup?

**Answer:** **Answer:** If handle alignment is off:
- **Use origin reference**: Use the origin point for precise alignment
- **Stay on axis**: Keep the handle aligned with the green axis
- **Use move tool carefully**: Use the move tool with proper snapping
- **Check center points**: Ensure the handle is centered on the cup
- **Adjust incrementally**: Make small adjustments until perfect

⚠️ **Alignment**: Use SketchUp's inferencing and axis system for precise alignment.

## Q&A #6

**Question:** 6. What is Aaron's step-by-step approach to creating an exploded view?

**Answer:** Aaron's approach is: 1) Start with the upper body and work down, 2) Use the Move tool to separate pieces vertically first, 3) Deselect one piece at a time and move it, 4) Work through the model systematically, 5) Move pieces horizontally as needed, 6) Handle components that repeat throughout the model.

## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. How does Aaron use the reference cube during the explosion process?

**Answer:** Aaron uses the 1" reference cube as a visual guide when using the Move tool. He can click from one point to another on the cube to move pieces by exactly one inch, ensuring consistent spacing throughout the exploded view.

---

## Q&A #12

**Question:** 12. What is the workflow for separating vertical parts in an exploded view?

**Answer:** The workflow for vertical separation is: 1) Select the pieces you want to move, 2) Use the Move tool, 3) Click on the reference cube to establish the movement distance, 4) Move the pieces up, 5) Deselect one piece at a time and repeat the process to create layered separation.

---

## Q&A #21

**Question:** 21. How does Aaron handle pieces that need to move in different directions?

**Answer:** Aaron handles different movement directions by selecting pieces individually and using the Move tool to move them in the appropriate direction (up, down, left, right, forward, back). He uses the reference cube to maintain consistent spacing regardless of direction.

## Q&A #24

**Question:** 24. What is the advantage of using the Move tool for creating exploded views?

**Answer:** The Move tool provides precise control over piece positioning and allows you to use reference objects (like the 1" cube) for consistent spacing. It's also the standard tool for this type of operation in SketchUp, making it familiar and reliable.

## Q&A #25

**Question:** 25. What is the overall workflow for creating a complete exploded view?

**Answer:** The complete workflow is: 1) Ensure all pieces are properly organized as components or groups, 2) Create a reference cube for consistent spacing, 3) Start with larger assemblies and work down to individual pieces, 4) Use the Move tool systematically to separate pieces vertically and horizontally, 5) Take advantage of components that repeat throughout the model, 6) Switch to Parallel Projection for the final view, 7) Turn off axes for a clean appearance, resulting in a clear exploded view that shows how all pieces fit together.

## Q&A #12

**Question:** 12. How do you fix out-of-plane geometry?

**Answer:** To fix out-of-plane geometry, use the Move tool to grab the problematic point and move it vertically to the same height as the other points. Once all points are at the same Z-coordinate, the face should close properly.
