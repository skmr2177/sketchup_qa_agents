**Question:** 4. How does the 3D Text tool automatically align text to surfaces when placing it?

**Answer:** Answer:
The 3D Text tool automatically aligns to surfaces through:
• **Surface snapping:** As you move the mouse over different surfaces, the text automatically aligns to them
• **Face detection:** The tool detects faces and snaps the text to align with the face orientation
• **Intended placement:** The tool is designed specifically for placing text on surfaces, though you can place it on the ground if needed

This automatic alignment makes it easy to place text on walls, floors, or any other surfaces in your model.

## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. What are the advantages and limitations of the 3D Text tool compared to other text methods?

**Answer:** Answer:
**Advantages:**
• **3D capability:** Creates actual 3D geometry with depth
• **Surface integration:** Automatically aligns to surfaces
• **Flexible manipulation:** Can be modified like any other geometry
• **Professional appearance:** Creates realistic 3D text for presentations

**Limitations:**
• **No post-placement editing:** Cannot change text content after placement
• **Geometry conversion:** Becomes permanent geometry, not editable text
• **File size:** Can increase model file size significantly
• **Performance:** Complex text can impact model performance
