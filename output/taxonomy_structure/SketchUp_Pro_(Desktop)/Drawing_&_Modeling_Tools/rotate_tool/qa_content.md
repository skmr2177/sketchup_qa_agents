## Q&A #6

**Question:** 6. What is the process for straightening a reference image that's slightly skewed?

**Answer:** Answer:
To straighten a skewed reference image:
• **Identify center line:** Find a line that should be straight (like the center line of a boat)
• **Draw reference line:** Create a line on the center line for easier snapping
• **Group select:** Select both the image and the reference line
• **Use Rotate tool:** Click at one end, then the other end of the line
• **Snap to axis:** Drag the end until it snaps to the red axis
• **Result:** The image is now properly aligned for accurate modeling

This ensures that lines that should be straight are actually straight in your model.
