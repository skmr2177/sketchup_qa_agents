**Question:** 5. What is the instructor's revelation about the Pi tool and how does he use it?

**Answer:** The instructor calls the Pi tool his "revelation when I was practicing this video." He explains that for the Follow Me tool to work properly, shapes need to be perpendicular to the follow path. While you could use circles locked to axes, they wouldn't necessarily be perpendicular. The Pi tool solves this: click and drag along the first segment of your follow me path, then let go and draw. This creates shapes that are automatically perpendicular to the path, making the Follow Me tool work much better for organic modeling like condiments.

## Q&A #15

**Question:** 15. How does the instructor handle the Follow Me tool for organic shapes?

**Answer:** The instructor demonstrates advanced Follow Me techniques for creating organic condiment shapes. He emphasizes that shapes must be perpendicular to the follow path, which is why he uses the Pi tool revelation. He creates 5-sided polygons for the condiment cross-sections, clicks and drags along the first segment of the follow me path, then draws the shape. He uses 360 degrees to go all the way around, then scales appropriately. He notes that positioning is crucial - the condiments must stay on top of the hot dog surface, not penetrate into it.

## Q&A #23

**Question:** 23. How does the instructor demonstrate the importance of perpendicular shapes for Follow Me?

**Answer:** The instructor emphasizes that for the Follow Me tool to work properly, shapes must be perpendicular to the follow path. He explains that while you could use circles locked to axes, they wouldn't necessarily be perpendicular to curved paths. This is why he uses the Pi tool revelation - it creates shapes that are automatically perpendicular to the path. He demonstrates this with both the hot dog sausage and the condiments, showing how perpendicular cross-sections create proper extrusion along curved paths.

## Q&A #5

**Question:** 5. What specific technique does Aaron use for the radial follow me operation?

**Answer:** Aaron places a **circle on the floor** at the origin point to serve as the rotation path. He notes that the number of edges in this circle (24 sides by default) will determine how smooth the final wine glass appears. Aaron explains that for background objects, 24 sides is fine, but for "hero items" he might increase it to 48 sides for smoother results. He then uses the **follow me tool** with the wine glass profile and the circular path to create the 3D wine glass shape. Aaron demonstrates that this creates the complete wine glass form through rotation around the center axis.

## Q&A #24

**Question:** 24. What does Aaron explain about the follow me tool's requirements?

**Answer:** Aaron demonstrates that the **follow me tool requires a continuous path** (the circle) and a profile shape (the wine glass half). He shows that the profile must be properly prepared with welded edges to create smooth results. Aaron explains that the number of edges in the rotation circle affects the final smoothness, and that the profile shape directly determines the 3D result. He emphasizes the importance of testing the profile before committing to the full follow me operation to avoid creating unintended shapes.

## Q&A #4

**Question:** 4. How do I create the rounded top edge of the coffee cup?

**Answer:** **Answer:** To create the rounded top edge:
- **Draw horizontal line**: Create an edge across the top of the cup
- **Use inferencing**: Draw on the red axis for proper alignment
- **Create profile circle**: Draw a circle on the green axis for the rounded edge
- **Use Follow Me tool**: Follow the circle along the top edge path
- **Clean up geometry**: Remove unwanted internal geometry

✅ **Pro Tip**: Use X-ray mode to see and remove internal geometry that shouldn't be there.

## Q&A #7

**Question:** 7. How do I shape the handle profile?

**Answer:** **Answer:** To shape the handle profile:
- **Draw base circle**: Start with a circle of appropriate size
- **Scale and deform**: Use scale tool to squish and shape the circle
- **Create center line**: Draw a path for the handle to follow
- **Use Follow Me tool**: Follow the profile along the center line
- **Adjust proportions**: Scale the handle to match the cup size

⚠️ **Tip**: The handle profile should be smaller than the cup diameter for realistic proportions.

## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. How do I use the Follow Me tool effectively for curved shapes?

**Answer:** **Answer:** To use Follow Me effectively:
- **Create profile**: Draw the shape you want to follow a path
- **Draw path**: Create the path the profile should follow
- **Select profile first**: Click on the profile shape
- **Activate Follow Me**: Click the Follow Me tool
- **Click on path**: Click on the path to create the 3D shape

✅ **Pro Tip**: The Follow Me tool is essential for creating curved and organic shapes.
