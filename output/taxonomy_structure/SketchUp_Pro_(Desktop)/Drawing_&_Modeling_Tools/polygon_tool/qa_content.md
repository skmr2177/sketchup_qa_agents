**Question:** 2. How does the instructor start creating the bun and why does he choose polygons over circles?

**Answer:** The instructor begins by creating a new file and immediately chooses to use **polygons instead of circles** because he wants that "low poly like faceted look." He uses the polygon tool with 12 sides (12s) and locks it to the green axis using the left arrow key. He creates it with a 1-inch radius, then uses shift+Z to zoom to the extents of the polygon. This approach gives the bun a stylized, geometric appearance rather than a smooth, circular one.
