## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. How do I fix incomplete faces after intersection?

**Answer:** **Answer:** To fix incomplete faces:
- **Identify gaps**: Look for areas that didn't close properly
- **Draw missing edges**: Add lines to complete the shapes

## Q&A #2

**Question:** 2. What is the Migrate Extensions feature and why is it number five on Aaron's list?

**Answer:** Answer:
Migrate Extensions is an extension available under Extensions > Migrate Extensions that allows users to:
‚Ä¢ **Transfer extensions:** Grab extensions from an old version of SketchUp and install them in the current version
‚Ä¢ **Selective migration:** Choose which extensions to bring over rather than migrating everything
‚Ä¢ **Avoid extension bloat:** Prevent having too many extensions installed by being selective
‚Ä¢ **Easy setup:** Complete the migration process with just a few clicks

Aaron ranks it number five because it solves the problem of manually reinstalling extensions when upgrading SketchUp versions, while still allowing users to be selective about which extensions they want.

## Q&A #14

**Question:** 14. What if my objects aren't showing as solids?

**Answer:** **Answer:** If objects aren't showing as solids:
- **Check grouping**: Make sure all geometry is in a single group
- **Use Solid Inspector**: Install the free Solid Inspector extension
- **Verify geometry**: Ensure there are no loose edges or faces
- **Check for errors**: Look for geometry issues that prevent solid status
- **Recreate if needed**: Sometimes rebuilding the geometry helps

‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Issue**: Objects must be properly grouped to be recognized as solids.

## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. What's the difference between Weld and Soften/Smooth?

**Answer:** **Answer:** The differences are:
- **Weld Edges**: Connects separate edges into a single smooth edge
- **Soften/Smooth**: Makes edges appear smooth without changing geometry
- **When to use Weld**: When you have separate edge segments
- **When to use Soften**: When you want to hide edge lines
- **Combined approach**: Often use both for best results

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Weld is now native to SketchUp (no extension needed).

## Q&A #6

**Question:** 6. What were the key considerations for the canopy design?

**Answer:** **Answer:** The canopy needed to cover the entire courtyard and Eric wanted it to have movement "so it felt more like a cloud rather than just a straight shot which would feel very forced." He designed it to be made up of smaller pieces of glass (inspired by the British Museum reference) with supporting structure to create a wave-like movement. The undulation of the canopy created interesting effects, such as making it appear "like this canopy's being lifted up like a blanket or a curtain" revealing people on the balcony. Eric notes this was a fun exercise that required multiple attempts and some extensions to perfect.
