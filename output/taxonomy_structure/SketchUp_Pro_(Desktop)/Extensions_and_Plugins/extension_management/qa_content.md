**Question:** 9. How does the Migrate Extensions feature help with extension management?

**Answer:** Answer:
Migrate Extensions helps with extension management by:
• **Selective transfer:** Users can choose which extensions to bring over
• **Avoid bloat:** Prevents installing unnecessary extensions
• **Easy setup:** Simplifies the upgrade process
• **Clean start:** Allows users to evaluate which extensions they actually need
• **Time saving:** Eliminates manual reinstallation of extensions

This feature addresses Aaron's previous concerns about automatic extension migration by giving users control over the process.
