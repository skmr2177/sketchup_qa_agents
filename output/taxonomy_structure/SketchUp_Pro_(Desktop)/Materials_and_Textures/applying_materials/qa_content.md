## Q&A #9

**Question:** 9. How does Aaron handle edge visibility and final presentation?

**Answer:** Aaron selects all geometry and uses **right-click > deselect faces** to select only the edges, then turns them off to remove edge lines. He also turns off **profiles** in the style settings to remove the dark edge lines around the glass. Aaron moves the wine glass off the origin to avoid the blue axis line running through it, noting that would be "unappetizing." He emphasizes that the final result shows just the glass and wine materials with reflections and light bouncing off the surfaces, creating a realistic wine glass appearance.

---

## Q&A #13

**Question:** 13. How does Aaron demonstrate material application techniques?

**Answer:** Aaron shows **applying materials to specific faces** rather than entire groups. He explodes the group to work with individual surfaces, then clicks on specific faces to apply the glass material. For the wine material, he demonstrates using the **modifier key for "all connected"** to apply the material to all matching surfaces at once. Aaron shows that this approach allows for precise control over which parts of the model receive which materials, creating the realistic effect of clear glass with colored liquid inside.

---

## Q&A #16
