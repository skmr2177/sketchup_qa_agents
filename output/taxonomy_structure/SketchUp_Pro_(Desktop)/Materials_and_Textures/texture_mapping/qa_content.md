## Q&A #18

**Question:** 18. What is the importance of the "Use As Texture" setting?

**Answer:** The "Use As Texture" setting is crucial because it tells SketchUp to treat the imported image as a texture material rather than a simple image. This enables proper texture mapping and tiling capabilities on curved surfaces.
