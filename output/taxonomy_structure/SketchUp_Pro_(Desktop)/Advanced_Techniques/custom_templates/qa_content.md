## Q&A #9

**Question:** 9. How does Aaron explain the difference between default and custom templates?

**Answer:** Aaron shows that **default templates are hardcoded and cannot be messed up** - they're protected. Custom templates are just regular SketchUp files in a specific folder. He demonstrates using **File > New** (uses default template) versus **File > New from Template** (lets you choose any template). Aaron shows the heart icon that indicates the default template, noting "only one of these can have my heart" and that's the template that appears when you just hit "new."

## Q&A #18

**Question:** 18. What does Aaron recommend about template naming and organization?

**Answer:** Aaron names his template "Aaron template because Aaron made this template" and explains that template names should be descriptive and indicate who created them or what they're for. He shows that templates appear in the selection dialog with their names, so clear naming helps identify which template to use. Aaron demonstrates that you can have multiple custom templates and choose between them based on your current project needs.
