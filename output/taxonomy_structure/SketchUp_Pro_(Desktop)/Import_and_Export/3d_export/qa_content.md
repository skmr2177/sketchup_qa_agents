## Q&A #3

**Question:** 3. What are the three exports Eric creates from SketchUp for his sketching workflow?

**Answer:** **Answer:** Eric creates three separate exports: 1) **SketchUp lines** - using hidden line style with no sky for clean black and white lines, 2) **SketchUp shadows** - with profiles and edges turned off, shadows enabled, and adjusted lighting to avoid too-dark foreground, and 3) **Color by tag** - with shadows off, face style set to shaded with textures, and color by tag enabled with darkness at 90 and lightness at 0 for uniform colors. Each export serves a specific purpose in the Photoshop workflow.

## Q&A #5

**Question:** 5. How does Eric prepare the shadow export and why does he adjust the lighting?

**Answer:** **Answer:** Eric turns off profiles and edges so everything disappears, then enables shadows. He darkens the shadows to a point where they can be selected in Photoshop, but not too light. He adjusts the time of day to push shadows earlier in the morning so more of the courtyard is in sun, avoiding a too-dark foreground. He exports this as "Su shadows" and notes that he can always adjust the color later in Photoshop.
