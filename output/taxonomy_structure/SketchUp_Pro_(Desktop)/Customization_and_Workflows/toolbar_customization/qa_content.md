## Q&A #7

**Question:** 7. How does Aaron demonstrate creating and organizing tags in his template?

**Answer:** Aaron shows creating three specific tags: **"ref" for reference layer** (which he uses a lot), **"main" for main content**, and **"existing" for existing/remodel work**. He explains that if you "use the same tags repeatedly" for similar work (like designing houses), you can set them up in your template and they'll show up automatically populated. Aaron warns that **empty tags will be removed if you purge**, so you need to be conscious of this when setting up template tags.

## Q&A #20

**Question:** 20. What does Aaron demonstrate about template customization workflow?

**Answer:** Aaron shows a complete template customization workflow: **changing the scale figure** (replacing TomTom), **modifying styles** (turning off profiles, changing colors), **adding environments** (At Sea with reflections), **including components** (wine glass), **creating tags** (ref, main, existing), and **saving the template**. He demonstrates that each customization is done once and then saved, eliminating the need to repeat these steps for every new model.

## Q&A #19

**Question:** 19. What is the benefit of having layers pre-configured in a template?

**Answer:** Pre-configured layers save time because you don't have to create organizational layers from scratch each time you start a new project. You can immediately start grouping elements and assigning them to appropriate layers (like "first floor") without the setup overhead.

## Q&A #20

**Question:** 20. How does Aaron demonstrate the efficiency of using a custom template?

**Answer:** Aaron demonstrates efficiency by showing how quickly he can work: he can snap windows into walls, throw in doors, add reference items like cars and bushes, and immediately start organizing elements into pre-existing layers. This eliminates the repetitive setup work that would otherwise be required for each new conceptual project.
