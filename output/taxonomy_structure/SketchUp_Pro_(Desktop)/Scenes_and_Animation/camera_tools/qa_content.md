**Question:** 1. What is the main feature Aaron introduces in this tutorial?

**Answer:** Aaron introduces the **"Apply Tags to Scenes"** functionality that was introduced in SketchUp 2025. He emphasizes that this feature is only available in SketchUp 2025 and forward - it won't work in 2024 or earlier versions. Aaron explains that this tool provides a quick way to update scene visibility settings for multiple tags at once, eliminating the need for manual tag management across multiple scenes. He notes that this is a significant improvement over the previous manual process of updating each scene individually.
