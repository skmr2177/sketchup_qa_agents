## Q&A #19

**Question:** 19. What does Aaron demonstrate about the visual feedback of the feature?

**Answer:** Aaron shows that after using Apply Tags to Scenes, **clicking through the scenes (D, E, F) reveals that the imported objects (A, B, C) are completely hidden**. He demonstrates that the feature successfully applies the tag visibility status across all selected scenes, creating clean scene transitions without unwanted geometry. Aaron emphasizes that this provides immediate visual confirmation that the feature is working as intended.

## Q&A #24

**Question:** 24. How does Aaron demonstrate the practical application of this feature?

**Answer:** Aaron shows a real-world scenario where you **import geometry with its own tags** into a base model with existing scenes. He demonstrates that the imported tags don't automatically integrate with the scene system, creating visual clutter. Aaron then shows how Apply Tags to Scenes solves this problem by allowing you to quickly update all scenes to hide the imported tags, creating clean scene transitions.
