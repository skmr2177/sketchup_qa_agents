## Q&A #23

**Question:** 23. How does Aaron demonstrate the template preview and selection process?

**Answer:** Aaron shows that when you use **File > New from Template**, SketchUp displays a dialog with all available templates organized by category. He demonstrates selecting different templates and shows how the interface displays template options. Aaron explains that the heart icon indicates the default template, and clicking different hearts changes which template is used for regular "new" commands. He shows how this interface makes template selection intuitive and organized.
