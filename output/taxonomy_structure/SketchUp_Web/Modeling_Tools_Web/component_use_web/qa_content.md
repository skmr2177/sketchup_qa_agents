**Question:** 6. What does Aaron explain about including components in templates?

**Answer:** Aaron demonstrates adding a wine glass component to his template and explains that **any components you drag into the template will be available in the component browser** for new files. He notes that components don't have to be visible in the model - they can just be saved in the component browser. However, Aaron warns that **adding many components can "weigh down an empty template"** because SketchUp has to load all components even if they're not visible, which can slow down file opening. He recommends being selective about which components to include.

## Q&A #11

**Question:** 11. How does Aaron demonstrate the relationship between templates and file size?

**Answer:** Aaron explains that while most template elements (styles, tags, scenes) don't significantly affect file size, **components do impact the template weight**. He notes that if you put 70 components in a template, every new file will have to load all those components even if they're not visible, which can slow down file opening. Aaron demonstrates this by adding a wine glass component and showing it appears in the component browser of new files, but warns against overloading templates with unnecessary components.

## Q&A #19

**Question:** 19. How does Aaron explain the relationship between templates and the component browser?

**Answer:** Aaron demonstrates that **components added to a template appear in the component browser** of new files created from that template. He shows that even if components aren't visible in the template model, they're still available for use in new files. Aaron explains that this is useful for frequently used components like "2D scale figures, face me trees, furniture, cars, whatever set dressing you use the same one all the time."

## Q&A #21

**Question:** 21. How does Aaron explain the difference between template components and model components?

**Answer:** Aaron demonstrates that **components in the template model** (like the wine glass he adds) will appear in new files, while **components in the component browser** are available for use but not automatically placed. He shows that dragging components into the template makes them part of the template file, and they'll appear in new files created from that template. Aaron notes that this distinction is important for understanding what gets included in template files.
