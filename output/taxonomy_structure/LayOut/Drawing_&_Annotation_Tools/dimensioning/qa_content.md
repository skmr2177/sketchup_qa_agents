**Question:** 9. How does Draft Mode help with dimensioning and annotation work?

**Answer:** Draft Mode helps with dimensioning by **removing visual clutter** like thick line weights, rastered edges, property line shadows, and layered graphics. This makes it easier to see corners and snap to points when drawing dimensions. Eric demonstrates how much easier it is to grab a dimension when you can see the corner clearly without all the heavy graphics on top.
