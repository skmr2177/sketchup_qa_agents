**Question:** 2. What specific elements does Aaron explain are included in a SketchUp template?

**Answer:** Aaron details several key elements that make up a template: **components in the model** (like scale figures), **screen display settings** (axes on/off, camera type), **tags/layers** that you use repeatedly, **styles** (edges, profiles, materials, ambient occlusion, backgrounds, watermarks), **scenes** (front-facing, top view, side views), **environments** (new to SketchUp 2025), **components in the browser** (furniture, cars, set dressing), **fog and shadow settings**, and **model info settings** (units, dimensions, text preferences). Aaron emphasizes that all these elements are saved and will appear automatically in new files created from the template.

## Q&A #13

**Question:** 13. How does Aaron demonstrate the difference between model info and application settings?

**Answer:** Aaron explains that **application settings** (found in Settings) apply to all of SketchUp regardless of template, while **model info settings** (units, dimensions, text preferences) are saved with the template. He shows that model info settings like preferred units, dimension appearance, and text settings will be saved into the template and appear in new files. Aaron demonstrates that this distinction is important for understanding what gets saved with templates versus what applies globally to SketchUp.

## Q&A #5

**Question:** 5. What is the "Use Maximum Texture Size" setting and when should you use it?

**Answer:** Answer:
The "Use Maximum Texture Size" setting is found in Preferences > OpenGL and:
â€¢ **Improves clarity:** Makes imported images much clearer and more readable
â€¢ **Shows details:** Allows you to see fine details like dimensions and text
â€¢ **Performance warning:** May slow down SketchUp, but acceptable for reference work
â€¢ **Essential for precision:** Necessary when you need to read dimensions from plans
â€¢ **Temporary use:** Can be turned on when needed and off for regular modeling

This setting is crucial when working with detailed architectural plans where you need to read specific dimensions.
