# FAMd2oLvTlw NEW Optimized Model Data Import Export in SketchUp - Q&A

Q1. What are the main topics covered in this tutorial?
A1. This tutorial covers enhanced IFC import/export capabilities and cloud integration with Trimble Connect in SketchUp 2025.

Q2. How does the IFC import handle tags in SketchUp 2025?
A2. When importing an IFC file, all elements are automatically organized into their own tags nested under a higher-level "IFC Tags" group based on the tags assigned in the original IFC file. This makes it easier to navigate and manage the imported elements.

Q3. How can you access the imported data and properties for IFC elements?
A3. After selecting an imported IFC element, you can go to Window > Component Options to view all the associated data such as tag, property sets, IFC material, object type, name, description, and classification.

Q4. What new feature helps manage scenes when importing data?
A4. In SketchUp 2025, you can right-click on the Scenes panel and choose "Apply Tags to Scenes" to control which tags (and their associated geometry) are visible in each scene, preventing imported data from appearing in every scene.

Q5. How does the Trimble Connect integration work in SketchUp 2025?
A5. You can save a component from your SketchUp model directly to Trimble Connect. Then, in the SketchUp Web app, you can open that component, make changes, and save it back to Trimble Connect. Back in SketchUp desktop, you can reload the updated component from Trimble Connect.

Q6. What is the benefit of the Trimble Connect integration?
A6. The Trimble Connect integration allows multiple designers to work on different parts of the same model simultaneously, either in SketchUp desktop or the web app, and easily merge their changes by reloading components from Trimble Connect.

Q7. What new feature is available for Revit import in SketchUp Studio 2025?
A7. SketchUp Studio 2025 includes an updated Revit importer that works better than previous versions, especially on Windows.

Q8. How does the Revit import handle data and organization?
A8. When importing a Revit file, the importer creates a hierarchy of materials and tags that match the layers in the original Revit file. All data and attributes associated with each Revit family are imported and accessible in the SketchUp model outliner.

Q9. What are some key improvements mentioned for IFC import in SketchUp 2025?
A9. The IFC import in SketchUp 2025 brings more useful and well-organized data, automatic tagging and grouping of imported elements, and easy access to element properties and metadata.

Q10. How can you control which imported elements appear in which scenes?
A10. You can right-click on the Scenes panel, select "Apply Tags to Scenes", and choose which tags (and their associated geometry) should be visible in each scene, preventing imported data from appearing in every scene by default.

Q11. What is required for a SketchUp component to be saved to Trimble Connect?
A11. To save a component to Trimble Connect, the geometry must be a component (not a group or loose geometry).

Q12. How can you update a component in SketchUp desktop with changes made in SketchUp Web?
A12. After making changes to a component in SketchUp Web and saving it back to Trimble Connect, you can select the component in SketchUp desktop, right-click, and choose "Reload from Trimble Connect" to update it with the latest changes.

Q13. What is a recommended practice mentioned for placing components within other components?
A13. The tutorial suggests including markings or guides within a component to indicate where other components should be placed or aligned, making it easier for multiple designers to work on different parts cohesively.

Q14. What is the benefit of the updated Revit importer in SketchUp Studio 2025?
A14. The updated Revit importer in SketchUp Studio 2025 works better than previous versions, especially on Windows, and imports all data and attributes associated with each Revit family, making them accessible in the SketchUp model outliner.

Q15. How does the tutorial suggest organizing imported IFC elements?
A15. The tutorial suggests that after importing IFC elements, you can reassign their tags and names if desired, such as moving them into a "Structural" folder or renaming "IFC Beam" to simply "Beam".

Q16. What is the purpose of the "IFC Tags" group created during IFC import?
A16. The "IFC Tags" group is a higher-level group that contains all the imported IFC elements, organized into their respective tags based on the tags assigned in the original IFC file.

Q17. How can you view the specific data imported for an IFC element?
A17. After selecting an imported IFC element, you can go to Window > Component Options to view all the associated data, such as tag, property sets, IFC material, object type, name, description, and classification.

Q18. What is a recommended practice for working with multiple designers on the same model?
A18. The tutorial recommends using the Trimble Connect integration, where different designers can work on separate components of the same model simultaneously, either in SketchUp desktop or the web app, and then easily merge their changes by reloading components from Trimble Connect.

Q19. What is the benefit of the Trimble Connect integration for collaborative workflows?
A19. The Trimble Connect integration allows for efficient collaboration by enabling multiple designers to work on different parts of the same model concurrently, either in SketchUp desktop or the web app, and then easily merge their changes by reloading components from Trimble Connect.

Q20. How does the tutorial suggest organizing cement trucks in a landscaping scenario?
A20. The tutorial suggests placing cement trucks in groups of three or five, as odd numbers tend to look more natural than even numbers in landscaping scenarios.
