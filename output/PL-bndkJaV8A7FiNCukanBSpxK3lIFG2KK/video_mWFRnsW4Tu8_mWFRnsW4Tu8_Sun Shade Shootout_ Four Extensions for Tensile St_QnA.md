# mWFRnsW4Tu8 Sun Shade Shootout  Four Extensions for Tensile St - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate different extensions in SketchUp for creating tensile structures, such as sun shades or sun sails, which are fabric pieces held taut between multiple points with some sag or give.

Q2. How many extensions are covered in the tutorial?
A2. The tutorial covers four different extensions for creating tensile structures: Sandbox Tools, Soap Skin and Bubble, CurveLoft, and Topos Shaper.

Q3. What is the first extension covered, and how does it work?
A3. The first extension covered is Sandbox Tools, which is a standard extension shipped with SketchUp. It works by creating a flat grid geometry first, and then allowing the user to push down the center to create a swooping shape. However, it doesn't hold onto the ends perfectly, and the support points get pushed down.

Q4. How does the Soap Skin and Bubble extension work?
A4. Soap Skin and Bubble works by selecting the edges of the desired shape, and then using the "Skin" function to create a surface that connects to those exact edges. The user can then adjust the divisions and apply positive or negative pressure to control the sag or bulge of the surface.

Q5. What are the advantages of using CurveLoft for creating tensile structures?
A5. CurveLoft is one of the instructor's favorite extensions for modeling organic, flowy geometry because it's quick and easy to use. It creates a nice, ordered grid that flows with the shape of the geometry, and the drop or sag is based on the arcs provided as input.

Q6. Why was Topos Shaper included in the tutorial, and how did it perform?
A6. Topos Shaper was included because some viewers had requested to see if it could be used for creating tensile structures. However, the instructor acknowledged that Topos Shaper is primarily designed for creating terrain from topographical lines, and its performance for creating tensile structures was not ideal, as it was being used in an unintended way.

Q7. What is the instructor's recommended extension for creating tensile structures?
A7. The instructor's recommended extension for creating tensile structures is CurveLoft, due to its simplicity, the nice ordered mesh it creates, and the smoothness of the resulting surface.

Q8. When might the instructor consider using Soap Skin and Bubble over CurveLoft?
A8. The instructor might consider using Soap Skin and Bubble over CurveLoft if they need more control over how the surface bulges down or pops up, such as when modeling tensile structures under different loads or conditions (e.g., snow on the surface).

Q9. What are the sources for the extensions covered in the tutorial?
A9. Sandbox Tools and Soap Skin and Bubble are available on the Extension Warehouse, while CurveLoft and Topos Shaper are available through the SketchUp Plugin Store.

Q10. What does the instructor suggest viewers do if they have other use cases or extension requests?
A10. The instructor suggests that viewers leave comments below the video if they have other use cases they would like to see extensions face off in, or if they want more detailed coverage of specific extensions. The instructor welcomes any other ideas for future video topics.
