# -HeKkYSU0A4 Wicker Basket with ONE Key Extension   SketchUp Tu - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to use the SketchUp extension True Bend to model a wicker basket from scratch, creating overlapping pieces of wood geometry instead of using materials.

Q2. What extension is used in this tutorial?
A2. The extension used in this tutorial is True Bend by TomTom.

Q3. How does the tutorial start?
A3. The tutorial starts by drawing a rectangle near the base, raising it up, and coloring it with a lighter wood material oriented in the correct grain direction.

Q4. What technique is used to orient the wood grain texture correctly?
A4. To orient the wood grain texture correctly, a single face is selected, the texture position menu is opened, and the rotate 90Â° option is used to flip the texture orientation.

Q5. What is done after creating the initial rectangle?
A5. After creating the initial rectangle, it is made into a group, scaled up 11 times its original size, and three evenly spaced lines are drawn across its top.

Q6. How are the curved wicker pieces created?
A6. The curved wicker pieces are created by drawing arcs between the midpoints of the evenly spaced lines, duplicating one of the arcs, and welding all the pieces together.

Q7. What is done to prepare the end piece before the Follow Me tool?
A7. Before using the Follow Me tool, the end piece is rotated to be perpendicular (90 degrees) to the vertical pieces to avoid distortion when following the path.

Q8. How is the Follow Me tool used to create the woven wicker pattern?
A8. The Follow Me tool is used by selecting the end piece geometry and clicking on the path created by the vertical pieces, causing the end piece to weave in and out as it follows the path.

Q9. What is done after the initial woven wicker piece is created?
A9. After the initial woven piece is created, it is copied, flipped along the red axis, and the process is repeated to create additional woven layers stacked vertically.

Q10. How is the top rim of the basket created?
A10. The top rim is created by drawing a circle, pulling it out wider, extending it down to the midpoints of the overlapping wicker pieces, and applying a wood material.

Q11. What step is taken before using the True Bend extension?
A11. Before using True Bend, all the woven wicker pieces are grouped together into a single component.

Q12. How is the True Bend extension used to form the circular basket shape?
A12. In the True Bend extension, the grouped wicker component is selected, and the bend handle is pulled out fully along the red axis it was created on, forming the circular basket shape.

Q13. What adjustment is made after the initial True Bend result?
A13. After the initial True Bend result, the basket is rotated 5 degrees to give it a slight lean or tilt, and then the True Bend process is repeated.

Q14. How is the basket bottom created?
A14. The basket bottom is created by flipping the basket 180 degrees, moving it so the middle is at the origin point, drawing a circle scaled to fit just inside, and applying a light wood material.

Q15. What is added to turn the basket into an Easter basket?
A15. To turn it into an Easter basket, an arc is drawn across the top points, a rectangle is created and used with Follow Me to create a handle, and a dark wood material is applied to the handle.

Q16. What is mentioned about creating woven geometry without True Bend?
A16. It is mentioned that creating the woven geometry without True Bend would be possible but more work, requiring drawing each weave path individually and scaling them up consecutively.

Q17. What is the main benefit of using the True Bend extension highlighted in the tutorial?
A17. The main benefit of True Bend highlighted is that it simplifies the process of creating the curved woven geometry to a single click, going beyond just the standard SketchUp desktop tools.

Q18. What other tips are mentioned in the tutorial?
A18. Other tips mentioned include: using modifier keys for precise placement, making components, using hidden geometry, and checking the instructions at the bottom for modifier key commands.

Q19. How does the tutorial recommend learning if any part was too fast?
A19. The tutorial recommends rewinding and rewatching the video if any part was too fast, or even reloading the video to get an extra view count (though this was a joke).

Q20. What does the tutorial encourage viewers to do at the end?
A20. At the end, the tutorial encourages viewers to like the video, subscribe to the channel, and most importantly, leave a comment with feedback, questions, or suggestions for future modeling video ideas or useful extensions.

Q21. What is mentioned about the difficulty level of this modeling process?
A21. The tutorial mentions that this is probably an intermediate level modeling process, not quite advanced, but with some steps that may have been gone through quickly for beginners.

Q22. What is the benefit of the True Bend extension compared to modeling without it?
A22. The benefit of the True Bend extension is that it simplifies the process of bending the flat woven geometry into a curved shape with a single click, whereas modeling it manually would require drawing each curved weave path individually and scaling them up consecutively.

Q23. How is the initial rectangle oriented and scaled?
A23. The initial rectangle is oriented with the grain direction corrected using the texture position menu, and then scaled up 11 times its original size.

Q24. What is done to the grouped woven pieces before using True Bend?
A24. Before using True Bend, all the woven wicker pieces are grouped together into a single component.

Q25. How is the tilt or lean added to the basket shape?
A25. The tilt or lean is added by rotating the grouped woven component 5 degrees before applying True Bend to bend it into the circular basket shape.
