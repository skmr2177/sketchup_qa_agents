# HGjX -WI EVERYTHING New in SketchUp 2025 - Q&A

Q1. What are the two main components of Environments in SketchUp 2025?
A1. Environments in SketchUp 2025 consist of two main components: 1) A 360-degree panoramic photograph that acts as a sky dome around the model, and 2) Image-Based Lighting (IBL) that controls the look of materials in the model based on the environment.

Q2. How can you change the look of materials in your model using Environments?
A2. By flipping between different Environments, you can change how the materials in your model look and react to lighting. Additionally, you can rotate the sky dome environment to dial in the exact lighting and look you want for your materials.

Q3. What are Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials?
A3. Photoreal Materials in SketchUp 2025 use Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties. In the material editor, these new PBR materials have additional maps like metalness, roughness, normal, and ambient occlusion that control how the material reacts to lighting in a physically accurate way.

Q4. How can you generate PBR texture maps for your own materials?
A4. SketchUp 2025 includes a new "Generate Textures" feature that uses AI to automatically generate the necessary PBR maps (metalness, roughness, etc.) for any texture you provide. It also seamlessly tiles the texture.

Q5. What is the benefit of the new Trimble Connect integration?
A5. The Trimble Connect cloud workflow is improved, allowing you to import models directly from Trimble Connect into SketchUp. You can also save your SketchUp model back to Trimble Connect, enabling cloud-based collaboration and file sharing.

Q6. What is the "Apply Tags to Scenes" feature?
A6. When importing IFC files, tags for different IFC classes are added to your model. The "Apply Tags to Scenes" feature allows you to selectively show or hide these tags in specific scenes, giving you more control over your scene visibility.

Q7. What does the Extension Migrator do?
A7. The Extension Migrator tool allows you to migrate all your previously installed extensions from an older SketchUp installation to your new SketchUp 2025 install, saving you from having to manually reinstall each extension.

Q8. What is the purpose of the Purge Unused reminder?
A8. The Purge Unused reminder prompts you to remove any unused components, environments, or other data from your model when saving, helping to keep your file size optimized and your model running efficiently.

Q9. What are some of the improvements made to SketchUp's core modeling tools?
A9. Improvements include: pre-picking objects with the Rotate tool, new rotation grips, updated Snaps that snap between face differences, auto-updating text tool measurements, and a double-click shortcut in the Arc tool to round edges.

Q10. How has the Revit import process been improved in SketchUp 2025?
A10. The Revit import process now allows you to choose a specific 3D view to import from, only bringing in the geometry visible in that view. This results in a cleaner import without extraneous geometry slowing down your model. The import hierarchy in the Outliner has also been improved.

Q11. What are the improvements made to IFC file handling in SketchUp 2025?
A11. When importing IFC files, the different IFC classes are now imported on their own tags, and the associated data is stored in the Outliner, providing better organization and access to the imported IFC data.

Q12. How has the installation process for V-Ray been streamlined?
A12. When installing SketchUp Studio on Windows, you can now check a box to automatically download and install V-Ray for SketchUp as part of the Studio subscription.

Q13. Why was the Style Builder tool removed from SketchUp 2025?
A13. Style Builder was removed because the visualization needs and methods used to communicate design visions have modernized since Style Builder was first introduced. SketchUp 2025 includes new visualization tools to replace Style Builder's functionality.

Q14. What are some of the improvements made to the Move tool in LayOut?
A14. The Move tool in LayOut now has functionality similar to SketchUp, including the ability to cycle between making a copy or stamping objects using a modifier key, as well as the click-move-click operation.

Q15. How has the Rotate tool been updated in LayOut?
A15. The Rotate tool now works similar to SketchUp, allowing you to click once to set the rotation axis, click again to start rotating, and click a third time to lock the rotation in place.

Q16. How does the new Scale tool in LayOut work?
A16. You can now scale an object or group to a specific size by clicking once with the Scale tool to set the scale origin, clicking again to set the measurement point, and then typing in the desired size dimension.

Q17. What are the improvements made to the Join and Split tools in LayOut?
A17. The Join tool can now join multiple edges or geometry pieces into one continuous line in a single operation, rather than having to join them one by one. The Split tool works similarly, allowing you to split a continuous line or joined geometry into individual pieces.

Q18. What is the Zoom Window tool in LayOut?
A18. The Zoom Window tool (accessed by pressing Z) allows you to click and drag a rectangle to define a specific area to zoom into, giving you precise control over your zoom level and area.

Q19. How can you control visualization effects like ambient occlusion in LayOut?
A19. In the SketchUp Model panel in LayOut, under the Effects section, you can toggle ambient occlusion on or off for the SketchUp viewport. You can also change the environment lighting directly in LayOut.

Q20. What is the new export functionality from the Pages panel in LayOut?
A20. You can now select specific pages or a range of pages in the Pages panel, and export or print only those selected pages directly from the panel, without having to go through the File > Export dialog.
