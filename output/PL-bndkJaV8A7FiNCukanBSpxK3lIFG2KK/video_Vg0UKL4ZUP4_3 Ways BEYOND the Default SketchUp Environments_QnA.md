# 3 Ways BEYOND the Default SketchUp Environments - Q&A

Q1. What are environments in SketchUp and how were they introduced?
A1. Environments were introduced in SketchUp 2025 to provide image-based lighting for physically-based rendered (PBR) materials. They allow for unique visualization looks that were not accessible before in SketchUp.

Q2. How can you test out pre-made environments in SketchUp?
A2. You can go to the Environments panel, click the Environments dropdown, and select from the pre-made environments that ship with SketchUp. These environments can also be found on the 3D Warehouse.

Q3. Where can you find free HDR and EXR files to use as custom environments in SketchUp?
A3. The website Poly Haven (https://polyhaven.com/) has a free asset library with a collection of HDR and EXR files under the "HDRIs" section that can be used as custom environments in SketchUp.

Q4. How do you import a custom HDR or EXR environment into SketchUp?
A4. In the Environments panel, click the "+" button to import an environment, then select the HDR or EXR file you downloaded.

Q5. What is the importance of setting the sun location when using a custom environment?
A5. Setting the sun location using the "Set Sun Location" checkbox ensures that the reflections in your model match the shadows, making the reflections look realistic.

Q6. How can you adjust the brightness of a custom environment in SketchUp?
A6. You can use the "Environment" slider in the Environments panel to adjust the brightness of a custom environment.

Q7. How can you use a stock image as a custom environment in SketchUp?
A7. You can download a stock image, open it in a photo editing software like Photoshop, convert it to a 32-bit per channel mode, and save it as an EXR file. Then, import the EXR file into SketchUp as a custom environment.

Q8. What compression method is recommended for reducing the file size of a custom EXR environment?
A8. The tutorial recommends using the "zlib" compression method when saving an EXR file, as it results in a more manageable file size compared to other compression methods.

Q9. Why might you want to turn off the "Environment for SkyDome" option when using a custom environment?
A9. If the custom environment image does not seamlessly tile or looks messy when used as a SkyDome, you can turn off the "Environment for SkyDome" option to use the image as a background instead.

Q10. How can you create your own HDR environment using an iPad?
A10. You can use the paid app "HDReye" on an iPad. The app takes multiple exposures at different points around a location, stitches them together, and generates an EXR file that can be used as a custom environment in SketchUp.

Q11. What is a potential caveat of using a custom HDR environment created with an app like HDReye?
A11. The generated EXR file can be very large in size, which may slow down SketchUp, especially if you have complex geometry in your model.

Q12. How can you reduce the file size of a custom HDR environment created with an app like HDReye?
A12. You can open the EXR file in a photo editing software like Photoshop, adjust the resolution and compression settings, and save it as a smaller file size EXR.

Q13. What is a potential issue with using a custom HDR environment created from a specific location?
A13. The perspective and alignment of the environment may not match perfectly with the perspective and alignment of your SketchUp model, as environments are meant to be infinitely far away backgrounds.

Q14. How can you align a custom HDR environment with elements in your SketchUp model?
A14. You can use reference points or grids in the environment and rotate the environment in SketchUp to align it with corresponding elements in your model.

Q15. What are some advantages of using a clean, custom stock environment over a pre-made SketchUp environment or a custom HDR environment?
A15. A clean, custom stock environment can provide a simple, modern look that may not be available in the pre-made SketchUp environments or custom HDR environments. It can also be easier to work with and have a smaller file size compared to some custom HDR environments.

Q16. How can you create a product visualization using a custom environment in SketchUp?
A16. You can use a simple model with a clean texture, combine it with a custom environment as the background, and animate the rotation angle of the environment to create a product visualization with moving image-based lighting.

Q17. What is the purpose of the "SkyDome Exposure" setting in the Environments panel?
A17. The "SkyDome Exposure" setting adjusts the brightness of the reflections in your model, allowing you to control the intensity of the image-based lighting.

Q18. How can you share your experiences or techniques with custom environments in SketchUp?
A18. You can share your experiences, techniques, or any clever tricks you've discovered with custom environments in the comments section of the tutorial video.

Q19. What is the importance of liking and commenting on tutorial videos?
A19. Liking and commenting on tutorial videos lets the creators know that they are making videos that viewers find helpful and enjoyable, which encourages them to continue creating valuable content.

Q20. How can you suggest ideas for future SketchUp tutorial videos?
A20. You can suggest ideas for future SketchUp tutorial videos by leaving a comment on the tutorial video or contacting the creators directly.
