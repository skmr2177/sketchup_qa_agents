# yKqLsjI iSf yKqLsjI Find your Space with Space Finder - Q&A

Q1. What is Space Finder and what is its purpose?
A1. Space Finder is an extension available from the SketchUp team that analyzes your SketchUp model structure or building and identifies spaces or rooms within the floors. It allows you to assign information to these spaces, such as room types (e.g., bedroom, kitchen, bathroom), and export data like square footages.

Q2. How do you install Space Finder?
A2. Space Finder is available for free download and installation from SketchUp Labs, which is a platform where the SketchUp team releases different extensions and additional functionality for users to try out.

Q3. What is the first step after installing Space Finder?
A3. After installing Space Finder, the first step is to run the extension by going to Extensions > Space Finder. It will prompt you to fill out a questionnaire to help the SketchUp team understand how users are utilizing the extension.

Q4. What happens after running Space Finder on a SketchUp model?
A4. After running Space Finder, it creates a new scene or view in your model where the identified floors and spaces are highlighted, while the rest of the model is in wireframe. It also adds a new tag folder called "SketchUp Spaces" containing subfolders for each floor and the identified spaces within those floors.

Q5. How can you navigate and view the identified spaces?
A5. You can navigate and view the identified spaces using the Space Finder user interface (UI), which has tabs for Floors, Types, and Groups. The Floors tab shows the identified spaces on each floor level, the Types tab allows you to view and highlight spaces by assigned types, and the Groups tab lets you manually create groups of spaces.

Q6. How do you assign types or labels to the identified spaces?
A6. To assign types or labels to the identified spaces, you can select a space in the Space Finder UI and click the "Assign" button. This will bring up a list of predefined space types (e.g., garage, living room, kitchen) that you can choose from and assign to the selected space.

Q7. What are the different options for assigning space types?
A7. The space types are organized into categories like Residential (Single Family, Multi-Family), Commercial, and others. You can navigate through these categories to find the appropriate type for the space you're assigning.

Q8. How does Space Finder handle spaces with low ceiling heights?
A8. Space Finder has a setting for the minimum ceiling height, which is set to 1.8 meters by default. Any spaces identified with a ceiling height lower than this value will be marked with a candy-striped pattern, indicating they are considered "unusable" spaces, such as attic spaces or crawl spaces.

Q9. How can you visualize the assigned space types in your SketchUp model?
A9. After assigning space types, the identified spaces will be color-coded in the SketchUp model based on their assigned types. You can toggle the visibility of these colored spaces using the "SketchUp Spaces" tag folder in your model's Outliner.

Q10. How can you export the space data from Space Finder?
A10. Space Finder allows you to export the identified space data, including the square footage information, by clicking the "Export" button in the UI. This will generate a spreadsheet file with the space data broken down by level, type, and square footage.

Q11. What is the significance of the "visualized square footage" value in the exported data?
A11. The "visualized square footage" value in the exported data includes the square footage of all identified spaces, including attic spaces or other low-ceiling areas marked as "unusable." You may need to exclude these areas if you only want to consider usable living spaces.

Q12. How does Space Finder calculate the square footage of spaces?
A12. Space Finder calculates the square footage of spaces by considering the actual usable area within the walls, excluding the wall thickness itself. This ensures that the reported square footage accurately represents the usable floor area.

Q13. Can you import custom space types into Space Finder?
A13. Yes, if you have custom room types or space types that are not included in the predefined lists, you can create a CSV file with your custom types and import it into Space Finder.

Q14. What is the recommended workflow for using Space Finder effectively?
A14. The recommended workflow is to first try out Space Finder on a sample model to get familiar with its functionality. Then, use it on your actual project models, assign space types as needed, and export the data for further analysis or documentation purposes.

Q15. How can users provide feedback or suggestions for Space Finder?
A15. Within the Space Finder UI, there is a "Labs" button that allows users to submit feedback, suggestions, or recommendations directly to the SketchUp team responsible for developing the extension.

Q16. What are some potential use cases for Space Finder?
A16. Some potential use cases for Space Finder include:
- Generating accurate square footage calculations for residential or commercial buildings
- Documenting and labeling room types for architectural plans or presentations
- Analyzing space utilization and optimizing floor plans
- Exporting space data for integration with other software or databases

Q17. Is Space Finder limited to specific types of SketchUp models or projects?
A17. No, Space Finder can be used with any SketchUp model or project, regardless of its complexity or purpose (e.g., residential, commercial, interior design).

Q18. Can Space Finder handle multi-level or multi-story buildings?
A18. Yes, Space Finder can handle multi-level or multi-story buildings. It will identify and categorize spaces on each floor level separately.

Q19. How does Space Finder handle open-concept spaces or combined rooms?
A19. For open-concept spaces or combined rooms, Space Finder will identify them as a single space. However, you can manually assign different types or labels to different areas within that space if needed.

Q20. Can you exclude or ignore certain spaces from the Space Finder analysis?
A20. Yes, within the Space Finder UI, you can select a space and choose to ignore it, effectively excluding it from the analysis and data export.

Q21. How does Space Finder handle spaces that span multiple floors or levels?
A21. For spaces that span multiple floors or levels, such as a multi-story atrium or stairwell, Space Finder will identify them as separate spaces on each level. You may need to manually group or combine these spaces if desired.

Q22. Can you create custom groups of spaces within Space Finder?
A22. Yes, Space Finder includes a "Groups" tab in the UI, which allows you to manually create custom groups of spaces based on your specific needs or organizational requirements.

Q23. How does Space Finder handle spaces with irregular or complex shapes?
A23. Space Finder can handle spaces with irregular or complex shapes. It analyzes the model geometry and identifies spaces based on the enclosed areas, regardless of their shape complexity.

Q24. Can you use Space Finder in combination with other SketchUp extensions or plugins?
A24. Yes, Space Finder can be used in combination with other SketchUp extensions or plugins, as long as they are compatible and do not interfere with each other's functionality.

Q25. Is Space Finder suitable for use in professional architectural or design workflows?
A25. While Space Finder is a useful tool for quickly analyzing and documenting space data, it may not meet the rigorous standards or requirements of professional architectural or design workflows. Its primary purpose is to provide a convenient way to identify and label spaces within SketchUp models.
