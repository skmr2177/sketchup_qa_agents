# What's New in LayOut 2025 - Q&A

Q1. What are some of the new features in LayOut 2025 that make editing tools more similar to SketchUp?
A1. Some of the new features that make editing tools in LayOut 2025 more similar to SketchUp include:
- Copying and moving objects works like in SketchUp, with the ability to use modifier keys to copy once or create a stamp for multiple copies.
- Rotation works similarly, allowing you to grab a point and inference lock to other points or angles.
- Scaling also works with inferencing, allowing you to scale based on other points or angles.

Q2. How does the Join (previously called Glue) command work in LayOut 2025?
A2. The Join command in LayOut 2025 has been improved. Previously, you had to select each piece individually and join them one by one. Now, you can select multiple pieces at once and hit Join once to join all of them into final shapes. This makes it much easier to clean up line drawings or imported geometry.

Q3. What is the benefit of the new Split command in LayOut 2025?
A3. The Split command in LayOut 2025 allows you to break apart joined shapes or objects with a single click, without having to split each piece individually. This complements the improved Join command, making it easy to join and split objects as needed.

Q4. How has the integration of SketchUp's visualization features been improved in LayOut 2025?
A4. LayOut 2025 now integrates SketchUp's visualization features more seamlessly. When you have a SketchUp model viewport in LayOut, you can access the Effects panel and change the environment directly within LayOut. This allows you to toggle between different environments created in SketchUp without having to go back and forth between the two applications.

Q5. What is the new printing feature in LayOut 2025, and how is it beneficial?
A5. In LayOut 2025, you can right-click on the page tabs and select "Print" to print specific pages directly, without having to go through the File > Print menu. This is beneficial if you work on LayOut documents in a piecemeal fashion, as it allows you to easily print only the pages you need without having to select them from a list.

Q6. What other improvements have been made to LayOut 2025?
A6. In addition to the specific features mentioned, LayOut 2025 also includes overall performance improvements and upgrades, making it faster and more efficient than previous versions.

Q7. How does the new Copy and Move functionality in LayOut 2025 compare to SketchUp?
A7. The new Copy and Move functionality in LayOut 2025 works very similarly to SketchUp. You can use modifier keys to copy an object once or create a stamp for multiple copies. You can also use the arrow keys to inference lock and move objects in specific directions, just like in SketchUp.

Q8. How does the new Rotate functionality in LayOut 2025 work?
A8. The new Rotate functionality in LayOut 2025 allows you to grab a point on the object and rotate it while inferencing off other points or angles in the drawing. This works in a similar way to the Rotate tool in SketchUp, making it more familiar for SketchUp users.

Q9. How does the new Scale functionality in LayOut 2025 work?
A9. The new Scale functionality in LayOut 2025 allows you to scale objects by grabbing a point and inferencing off other points or angles in the drawing, similar to the Scale tool in SketchUp. This makes it easier to scale objects precisely based on existing geometry.

Q10. How does the Join command in LayOut 2025 handle complex shapes or multiple objects?
A10. The Join command in LayOut 2025 can handle complex shapes or multiple objects at once. You can select multiple pieces, even if they are part of different shapes or objects, and hit Join once to combine them into final shapes. This saves time compared to having to join each piece individually.

Q11. How does the Split command in LayOut 2025 work with joined shapes or objects?
A11. The Split command in LayOut 2025 allows you to break apart joined shapes or objects with a single click. If you have multiple objects or shapes that were previously joined, hitting Split once will separate them back into their individual pieces or components.

Q12. How does the integration of SketchUp's visualization environments work in LayOut 2025?
A12. In LayOut 2025, when you have a SketchUp model viewport, you can access the Effects panel and change the environment directly within LayOut. This allows you to toggle between different environments that you have created in SketchUp, without having to switch back and forth between the two applications.

Q13. Can you apply different visualization environments to different viewports in LayOut 2025?
A13. Yes, in LayOut 2025, you can apply different visualization environments to different viewports, even if they are displaying the same SketchUp model. This allows you to have different visual styles or environments for different views or pages within the same LayOut document.

Q14. How does the new printing feature in LayOut 2025 work?
A14. The new printing feature in LayOut 2025 allows you to right-click on the page tabs and select "Print" to print specific pages directly. From there, you can choose which pages you want to print, without having to go through the File > Print menu and select pages from a list.

Q15. What is the benefit of the new printing feature in LayOut 2025 for piecemeal work?
A15. The new printing feature in LayOut 2025 is particularly beneficial if you work on LayOut documents in a piecemeal fashion, completing a few pages at a time. Instead of having to select the pages you want to print from a list, you can simply right-click on the page tabs and select the specific pages you need to print, making the process more efficient.

Q16. What other improvements have been made to LayOut 2025 in terms of performance?
A16. In addition to the specific feature improvements mentioned, LayOut 2025 also includes overall performance upgrades and enhancements, making it faster and more efficient than previous versions.
