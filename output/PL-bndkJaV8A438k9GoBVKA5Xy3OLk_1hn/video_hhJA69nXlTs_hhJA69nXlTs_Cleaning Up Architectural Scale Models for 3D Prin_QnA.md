##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: cleaning up architectural scale models for 3d printing | expert tips #sketchup video id: hhja69nxlts playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhja69nxlts uploader: sketchup duration: 896 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:08:22.746080 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm erin and today i want to talk about preparing architectural models for 3d printing so any of you who know me know that uh i sketchup uh and i also 3d printing i do a lot of 3d printing uh i even wrote a book on 3d printing um i the idea of taking something that doesn't exist or something exists only in imagination or or something that and create it and and making into a real world thing so today i want to talk about doing that but with architectural models i know it's there's there's so many things if you're in 3d printing you' probably been on the sites where you download models or you've created stuff in sketchup and you know made stuff that sits on your desk or uh you know busts of famous people or whatever but um there's something cool about taking an existing model a design a building that you're going to create and and printing it out at scale um there's some caveats to that though and that's exactly the things that we're going to talk about right now all right so i have a simplified model here by simplified i mean this is already a solid so it is just it's one big piece so things if i zoom in here let's look uh the shutters you see here actually come back to the wall um i don't have mions or anything that these aren't clear pieces i can't see inside in fact inside if we were to let's go ahead and just pop our head in here we'll go break through this window you can see that inside is just a big empty space so this is already a solid i didn't go through that process um we've done other videos on creating solids that sort of thing uh if there's enough demand if if you really want to see how this process works taking from a full uh model out to a solid um let me know in the comments and we could possibly do that but it's not a quick it's not an easy process if this is a model that was created for you know architectural drawings where i have things broken into the top floor bottom floor uh interior walls doors trim all that stuff there's a lot of stuff that has to get deleted out um i'd to say it's as simple as grabbing it all and say make an outer shell sometimes you can get pretty close but realistically you end up deleting a lot of your tags you know just the all the interior groups all the all the everything that's not going to be seen on the outside and then unfortunately is a lot of work of cleaning up architectural details getting rid of some stuff um if i'm going to 3d print this at scale uh there's some stuff that i know i don't need i don't this house has gutters but that's not on there because that little super i mean think about how thick the material of a gutters that little piece of she sheet metal think about how thin that is now print that out at qu e inch equals a foot you know it's almost nothing so there's some details that just don't come along um door knobs is a perfect example too this this model did have a door knob uh i took it off because again it's going to be the size of a head of a pin once i print it out so that's the first point is certain details don't need to come along there's some stuff i could have done in here there's there's brick on the front of this building i could have put that brick in and tried to see if i could get that detail to show up in the print um i have seen models where uh shingles will were drawn and and actually showed up in the print so that would be possible too but generally speaking again if i'm going depending on how small i'm going to print this that's the other thing if i print this and it's you know a foot high i'm printing it in big chunks on a on a large format printer well that could work that could uh i could leave more detail in i'm not i'm printing this on a print bed of less than 6 in wide so this is going to be fairly small so that's actually the first thing we would talk about here right i'm going to take this group i'm going to just copy it over here and i'm going to take it and i'm going to scale it down i'm going to bring it this way and let's see what uh let's see what 0 2% so 02 is 2% of the original size let's see how big that is okay so if i draw a line from here to here it's going to tell me that's 9 in so this is already tooo big big this is still too big so i'm going to undo undo and i'm going to take this and i'm going to scale it again i'm going to scale it to 0.1% so one 100th of the size so 1% of the of the actual size this is modeled 1: one of course you can see that so here's my life scale figure yep all the same size so if i do that if i scale to 1% right it's be 4 in across so that's actually a pretty big print for a small printer but you can kind of get an idea of how big that's going to be now before we go any further well let's let's look at this let's say i was to take this export this as a solid throw it out to my printer and hit print what would happen well some stuff is not going to make it through um let's look at let's look at these columns columns are the first thing i always check out columns these look good these are this is what they look on the on the real building if i check this it tells me uh it's i don't know it's about a 16th of an inch well about a 16th inch isn't good enough so one of the things i do when i'm working with 3d prints is i generally change my units so i'm going to go to settings this is under sketchup on mac it's under the windows window or the windows menu on windows and i'm going to actually that's the wrong one i do that often i'm sorry for both of us we're just going to go to windows go to model info and we're going to go to units in units i'm going to change to decimal and then i'm going to change to 2 mm um i can do that for the other two also but right now i'm just really concerned about checking some dimensions so if i come in here and i draw a line from here to here it tells me that is about 1 mm um depending on the fidelity of your printer that is doable but assuming i'm printing it standing up this that means a bunch of little tiny squares that are 1 millimeter are going to get drawn over and over and over again coming up this uh that's sort of a red flag for potential failure so it's possible you could try it but i don't know how well that's going to look uh some other things here um and spoiler i did try to print this exactly this at scale and i think these printed but the material i put in here to this uh roof right here when i remove that i just demolished these posts so i don't actually know if they printed well or not uh the material removal process says killed them so um let's look at a window let's look at this window right over here so let's see from here to here that's half a millimeter and this depth here is also half a millimeter so think about how thick half a millimeter is that's not so the the print head's going to come along here come out come over come back oh this is even smaller let's look what's this this is125 mm so that is a really small move so it is possible that if i print this model at scale as it is now this will show up but odds are good it's going to kind of look a little melted rectangle on the side of it and that is exactly what it looks you can barely see this bump right here this bump in is kind of there but again as it prints the print head moves and it kind of it doesn't make these perfectly sharp edges i see right here it's going to kind of you know it curves them in a little bit with just the the nature of fdm melted material printing and this ends up looking kind of blurry real life out of focus so that's what happens to all the windows the other details i have on here little little z's on these uh barn door shutters right here they're tiny two less than a millimeter and how deep are they again1 1259 mm so very very small this stuff's all going to get lost it's going to look a little bump out on the side of it uh same with these up here they come out a little bit longer so what is that it's almost a mim but still super super small so all these details oh this is when i do i did when i first printed this this right here quarter of a millimeter uh tall detail right here didn't didn't show up at all so in the slicing so horizont you can be even more conscious about horizontal dimension or horizontal uh features think about again printing it's the head's going to come along this and draw each of these pieces right here uh the average uh quality that i print at is 0 2 millim per layer so if i come right here i'm going to draw a line this take that line and i'm going to move it up vertically 2 mm now 220x didn't 2x there we go so this is what each so every time the print head comes along this is how much of this wall it's going to draw so if you compare that dimension to this relief right here it's less than two lines so i can say with less than two lines it's probably not going to give me enough and i know it doesn't give me enough dimension there to actually show that so that these lines in the garage door dis appear completely when i actually print this out at this scale so what to do that's the question well fortunately i can show you here i have two models this is the same one this is the scale down version and then what i actually sent to the printer so look at some of the stuff that i have in here so first thing is the columns right yes i lose some of the detail i lose some of the the the triple column here the double column here and i just put in one big blocky thing but this one big blocky thing all the way across here is just a little over a millimeter so this is not huge this is not going to look uh big and awkward it's just going to have it's well it's going to exist i said these got knocked out look at my door look at my windows up here this is what i ended up creating so this still doesn't come out real far from the the face let's see how far out does it come so it's still only a quarter deep but you can see the windows push in a lot deeper that's almost 3/4 of of a millimeter there so this just gives me more detail this gives me depth that i can actually see when i look at the print same with the garage door look at the garage door right here i just made those little insets bigger and they're exaggerate one of the things to remember when you 3d print on a fdm printer is that when it prints it's going to it's melting plastic and that plastic is going to move it's going to expand it's going to contract that sort of thing so these exaggerated details i see here it does not look ridiculous when you actually print them again this is a little teeny thing that's going to sit on my desk this is the kind of detail you want i would say most detail should be nothing less than half a millimeter so i would actually probably if i print this again probably pull this out a little bit more just to give myself a little bit more depth a little more detail um and i said just you got to go a little bit bigger so while while look at these look at this one right here so these are two they kind of squished into one but again this is just just raising off the surface so that actually can see right here just a little teeny bump wasn't even noticeable so when you are printing architectural models for for 3d printing this is the kind of thing you should have in your head you want to have these exaggerated deeper details you want to have larger than real life pieces in here and this is just for exterior interior same thing comes into play uh you know a three and a half inch a 4 inch interior wall at 1% scale is super thin you may have to bump all your walls up to 8 in interior just to get them to show up in the print granted i could print this on a sla printer something does a little finer detail when it prints but i'm still going to have limitations with how thick a material can be before it's too fragile it's going to break uh while printing it needs additional that kind of thing so exaggerating making things bigger is kind of the key to get successful architectural prints out of sketchup so these are a lot of rules of thumb that i have come across this is not comprehensive this is not exhaustive by any means but these are the kind of things that i have learned when i when i first started 3d printing the first printer i ever used one of the first things i printed was a multi-story house and they had you know each floor was a separate model printed you could look down inside of it and i tried to print alt scale and it was just a total failure um the doors i ended up creating ended up being 6in wide slabs in the walls were maybe even a foot thick or something that um this was granted technology when i first started printing is not as advanced the printers weren't as good as they are now but i had to really beef everything up just to make it come out printable make it real at all so um yeah anyhow those are some rules that i have those are some ideas of of things you can do to take your architectural models there now and make them 3d printable it's not quick it's not easy there's not just a simple balloon this up button um so it is a little bit of work to get in there and make that happen but it is totally doable so and and really at the end having a architectural model you can just print out by yourself it is it is pretty cool if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below have you used sketchup for 3d printing have used it for architectural printing if so i'd love to hear what you learned and if you have any notes that you think others would to hear if you can think of something else you think would make a good video leave that down in the comments below we making these videos a lot we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
