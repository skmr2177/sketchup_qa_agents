##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: modeling a hot dog stand on the ipad video id: xuycwcgq2pi playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuycwcgq2pi uploader: sketchup duration: 939 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:08:08.418209 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , i'm donovan and in this video i'm going to be making a hot dog stand on the [music] ipad. so, this video is actually a -up video to 's video where he made a hot dog. i thought it'd be a fun exercise to take inspiration from that video and make a hot dog stand. now, unlike his low poly hot dog, i'm not going to make a low poly hot dog stand, but i'm going to do all of this on the ipad. unlike my cohorts over here at sketchup, i actually prefer modeling on the ipad as opposed to the desktop version. it's shocking, i know, but as someone that has an artistic background, modeling on the ipad is a lot more intuitive for me than trying to model on the desktop. admittedly, about 99% of all the modeling i do in sketchup is actually on the ipad. now, of course, everything i'm going to be doing on the ipad, you can do on the desktop. so, with that, let's get to it. so to get started, what i want to do is create a new document and then come in here with my first shape of just a rectangle. now, it's at this point that i have to make a confession. i've actually never bought a hot dog from a hot dog stand. so a lot of these dimensions, i'm just going to be guessing off reference pictures. but for this, what i want to do is i want to come in here and i want to make this about 39 in wide and about 55 in long. all right, that's my basic shape. come in here with my pushpull tool and bring it up say about three feet. it's a nice general size to start. what i want to do is go ahead and hit my select tool, triple click, and then make a component. i'm going to name this cart and create. all right. so on this, we need a little place to put our hot dog buns, a little place to cook our hot dogs, a place for condiments, and then a steamer over here. so to start, what i want to do is come in here and edit this document. so double click. now, what i want to do is i'm going to make some guides. me personally, i love guides. i use them all the time, especially here on the ipad. so i'm going to come in here, grab the tape measure from the edge. i'm going to go to the middle. then i want to come up let's say about three inches. and then from the side it automatically locks to that distance. and then from this side it locks to that distance as well. one more time. and now i want to split the difference in the middle. so i'm going to come over here. let's do 1.5 in on the other side. and now i have my sections. i'm going to come in here. i'm going to create a rectangle. go from that guide to this one. and then push pull. and i'm going to bring this down about 2 in. now i have my little tray. but you know what? i actually don't need this side to go all the way to the end. i want to bring that back a little bit. so i'm just going to push pull this face down. say about 9 in. so, now that i have this area, what i want to do is i want to come in here, get my tape measure, go to the middle again. automatically, it snaps. and then i want to come over this direction about about an inch and a half. let's say that. now, here's my guide. i want to make a circle from the center. pull it all the way out to the edge. okay. then my pushpull tool. grab it and bring it all the way over to this side. now, i do know that sometimes to heat up hot dogs, they have those hot rollers that they put them on. so, that's what this is going to be. so, now that i have one, i'm going to grab that. triple click. uh-oh. i'm building this inside of my already existing geometry. so, what i'm going to do, i'm i'm going to back up a little bit. i'm going to keep my guides, but i am going to unselect from that. so now i'm outside of my component. i can come in here and make a new component. grab that. push pull all the way to the end. so now when i come back and triple click, one, two, three. i've only have that selected and not the entire cart. so i'm going to make a make a component. we'll call this roller. i'm going to hit create. and there i've got one. i want to come in here and move make a copy. we're going to grab this edge. grab this edge and move it over about 2 and 1/2 in. say 2.5 just so we're exact and not guessing. hit enter. and now i want to make an array. i want more than just the one. and so i'm going to come up here again. let's say nine times. see if that's enough. oh, actually that was one extra. so, we'll just select that. then we'll delete it. that isn't quite centered. so, what i want to do is i want to come in here. i want to grab these and i want to move them over so it looks they're about centered. all right. now that i got those, i got my rollers. that's a great start. all right. so, next what i want to do is i want to make a little display case up here. so, using my guides, i'm going to grab the rectangle from that side to that, from that corner to that corner and then bring it up. we're going to bring it up about a foot and a half. so, 1 ft 6 in. all right. now, i'm going to make this into a component. make a component. we're going to call this scratch that out. call this display. hit create. all right. now, to come in and edit a component, double click and then i need my tape measure. again, one thing that's great about the ipad is that if you want to move between tools, there's a really easy method. you just double tap and it goes to the select tool. or if you double tap again, it goes to the tool that you were previously using. so, with my tape measure, i'm going to come over say about 78 of an inch. 78. and again, it locks to that distance. locks to that distance. locks to that distance. i'm going to come up here, go down to the middle, and then i want that distance to be the same. so from the middle, i'm going to come up 716, which is half of 7/8. and then again down. locks to that distance. now i'm going to grab my rectangle tool. i'm going to go from that guide to that guide. and then again from this guide to that guide. now i want this top display to go all the way through. i don't want this bottom display to go all the way through. so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make one more guide for myself. again come in here and instead of 7/16, we'll choose 1/8 because i'm thinking that's about the the thickness of the material that we're using. and so if i come in here with my pushpull tool, grab this bottom one, i'm going to snap it to that guide. and then i'm going to come in, grab this top one, push pull, and i'm going to go all the way to the edge, which goes all the way through. so now i have my display up here that goes all the way through. and the bottom. it stops at the edge of that material on the inside. now, i don't need these guides anymore. so, i can come in here. i can erase. erase one more time. click out of that. and now i have my little display right there, which is great. now, i've seen hot dog carts that, you know, have these steamer areas. so, what i want to do is i want to come and make a little steam tray. i'm going to do that with the arc. so, i'm going to come in here. i'm going to do a twopoint arc. go from this guide over to this guide. and then i'm going to bring it up. so we'll bring it up about seven and a half inches. that looks pretty good. now that's not a complete shape. it's just a line. so what i want to do is grab my pencil, go from that edge to that edge. and now i have my shape with a face on it. so what i can do is come over here and i can grab my pushpull. come to there. snaps to my guide. so now i have a little bit one of those trays that opens. now i just need a handle. so i'm going to come up here. i'm going to grab my tape measure. what we're going to do is on this face. we're going to come up. let's say about right there. that's a good spot. and again, i want to come over from here. i want to split the middle to the very center. that's my center . but for this, what i want to do is i want to make half of the shape and then flip it to create the other half of the shape. so, i'm going to grab i'm going to come over here, make another guide for myself. let's say about 3 in. all right. and then i'm going to grab the circle tool, bring it up, and then i'm going to grab my pen tool. i'm going to come out say about two and a half inches. and then i want to come over this direction. and we want to snap to that edge right there. what i want to do is create a handle. so, i'm going to grab the shape using the me tool and then bring it up and over. snap to that middle line. and i have half my handle. i'm going to go ahead delete that. so now that i have half my handle, what i can do is i can come in here and i can select it. go over, grab the flip tool along this axis to that edge. oh, accidentally flipped it. that's all right. add a copy. select out of it. there we go. don't need those guides anymore. so i can come in here, delete those guides, delete that guide. now i have my handle. since this is a hot dog cart, we do need wheels. what i want to do is utilize 3d warehouse. so, i'm going to come in here to 3d warehouse and i want to look for casters and search. that looks a pretty good one. flat surface to go against our flat surface. so, i'm going to click on it, download, and then bring it into my model. all right. i'm going to grab that corner. make sure it's on the move tool. snap it to that corner. i'm going to bring it down. see, about three inches. and then over about 3 in. and there we go. and now since i have one, i could utilize that flip tool again. flip. we're going to make a copy. grab this surface. snap to the middle. now it's over on that side. i want to add. grab that. now we're going to flip again. make a copy. we're going to grab this axis, snap it to the middle. now we got our four wheels on the bottom. all right. so, i want to make this handle for over here. and just over here, what i want to do is i just want to start with the pencil tool. i'm going to draw a line. we're going to come out about 3 in. we're going to come this way. it looks pretty good. and then from this point right here, we're going to make our circle from the center. i think i made the other [music] one 5/8. then we're going to go to the me tool. we're going to grab that shape and we're going to bring it out that way. say about right there. okay. now, we're going to
