##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today i want to talk about component modeling or modeling with components and how using components properly can mean you do half or maybe even one quarter of the work so this is not a new concept this is something we talk about regularly but it bears repeating because we see questions on this fairly regularly um sometimes i'm gna i'm going to say some crazy stuff right now but some people don't understand why to even use groups and don't know the difference in groups or components can you believe that so i wanted to just make a quick video to show the advantages of using components and copies of components when you're modeling a single thing so this gets away a little bit from if there's a repeating element in your model right if there's there's the same thing as in your model a dozen different times and you model this component once that way if you change the first one they all change that's still a thing that's valid but what i want to look at here is modeling a single thing but only modeling a portion of it and having it repeat all right so in here brand new clean model so what i want i just want to model a quick and and simple table so how i would probably go about this if i wasn't thinking about it i'd come in here i'd model the tabletop i'd give it some depth um this is ugly table uh but that's okay i'm going to move it up however far it's supposed to be up and then maybe i come in here and i'll do something uh you know draw some legs and then we'll bring that down and then maybe grab all that and you know copy it over to here and then take those and copy it over to here something along those lines i would do those would be the general steps now i cut some corners right i didn't use exact measurements when i moved the legs around i didn't componentize or group anything it's all raw geometry so there's some dumb stuff there but the dumbest part of what i did was if you look at this if i if i chop this table in half right down the middle it's the same on either side so let's talk about how we could make that with components so i'm going to start by drawing half the table and then uh you i'll come in here and i will give it you know actually before i give it depth let's let's say i want to round off the corners okay so that might be so i'm going to draw an arc from here to here double click and then i'm going to come up double click right here that gives me rounded corners and i'm going to take that push pull it to give it a little bit of depth and now at this point i'm going to grab it and make it a component and i will call it half table now now my half table exists so what do i need to do now well i need to put legs on it right so i'm going to go ahead and lift it up here and i got to get my legs on under here but before i do that i'm going to take it and i'm going to make a copy i'm going to put my copy right over here and this way uh when i make the legs on here they'll show up over here too now obviously first things first it was really obvious when i copied it over here that i copied it in the wrong spot right because my curves on here but if i had done the same thing with a rectangle i' taken that rectangle and copied it over here i would have been able to necessarily tell the difference right if i come straight over the two halves look the same so an important thing to note when you're modeling this is how you get this other piece over here so i could take this now i could scale it i could rotate it i could figure out a different way to do it but i want to tell you the easiest way is using the flip command so if i grab this i say flip i hit my modifier key down here at the bottom it's going to tell you modifi modifier to make a copy i'm going to copy right over to its face now what that did was it inverted the whole thing so that means when i come in here and i go okay i'm going to come in here and i'll make round legs here i'll inference this circle right here there we go i'm going do that and then pull that down to to the base here that see how both sides got them on the same spot again i'm making i'm i'm working smarter not harder i'm going to copy that over here and soon as i do that as soon as i copy this leg over it's going to show up here my four legs are done at that point quick and easy now this is a great way uh people call this out fairly regularly to me while i'm modeling people point out oh you when you uh uh model that building your model modeling both halves of it and a lot of it's the same that's absolutely true and uh this is what i should be doing split something at symmetric down the middle model both halves even if they're not perfectly symmetrical right maybe there's some features on this table that are only on one side maybe there's a keyboard tray i don't know i'm making up stuff probably not on a table this this looks a play table for a kid but if 90% of of something is symmetrical go ahead make your component make your changes and then you know halfway in make this unique and then make those other changes that don't have to be the same with something a table even a rectangular table uh i could go a little bit further with it right so i could come in here i could make my corner of a table give that a little bit of depth and then i'll grab that make that into a component i'm going call this a quarter table and i'll do the same thing i will select it i will say mirror that hit my modifier key to make a copy mirror this over here then select both of them and then mirror again again modifier key to make a copy bring that over to the edge there and now i have four pieces of my table now if i come over here let's go under here let's add go into one copy right just one of them and then i'm going to put in my leg even less work than what i did over here i only to make one leg and again i'm making this super simple you but i could put as much detail as i want in here it would all be the same uh and it would only have to be done once now here's the thing i got a big x in my table that's not ideal right i'm looking at my table i don't i don't want to have that that's simple enough i'm going to double click on this one and here's a thing that i run into a lot is when i'm editing this one piece it's hard to necessarily to see everything because all the other copies are here so if i go over to view and i go to component edit and i hide similar components not rest of model rest of model is going to get rid of all those other tables right so if i go to component and say hide similar components it hides just everything but the one i'm working on now let's clean this up so it works good as a component i'm going to go ahead and erase this line right here erasing that line just erases these edges i don't need those they'll always be covered up and then i'm going to use the hide modifier with the erase so if i come down here shift is going to toggle hide shift going to drag it across both these edges both these edges now when i click to come out of here i have what looks oops i missed one i missed two do that again shift get rid of that little one and then over here we going to have one more get rid of him too all right there we go now we have what looks one solid piece and again because it's still a component i could comm in i could do something um i don't know maybe i want to grab this and slide it over this way because i'm making it some cool looking table thing i can make that change once and because it's a component it's going to go ahead and do that on all four sides now there's downsides to this of course right so if i'm trying to make this a solid because i want to send a miniat version of my 3d printer these four pieces will have to get consolidated into one piece if i'm trying to come up with a cut list how big is this piece well this isn't a piece it's four separate pieces so there's going to be a point at which you might want to go grab all of this and then we'll just make a copy of it over here here's how it would go about that with all four pieces selected right click make group now go into that group select my four uh component copies and explode with that now this is one piece and i could come in i could do some i could do some additional cleanup right because i did i did break that so i could say show me my hidden geometry get rid of that geometry all together tie that all together i could do a select get rid of my little line there around this side little line there there we go and with that now it's one piece so if i did want to make this a solid to print it i could if i wanted to check you know what is the length of this piece of material it is one piece now so i could in theory get a cut list with a with an extension or something that but with that uh i did model that table one quarter of the work and again it's simple but if i had fancy legs and you know uh some me skirt or something that around the outside uh it would all be able to be done one quarter of the work to get the same final table at the end so this is some of the true power of components i said there is other things if i'm doing a you know a model of an exterior and i have a traffic cone and i put a bunch of traffic cones on there i can make them components that way if i want to change the color height size whatever i just have to do it once so that is definitely a powerful piece of components but people don't always think about using them to model a single thing so if you ever have repeating geometry look at your model beforehand and save some time by modeling it fewer times and using components to duplicate uh yeah that's what we got today if you that if you learned anything or if you just enjoyed the video go ahead and click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and to be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please leave us a down below let me know what you think of this process do you use this do use something this did i miss something or can you think of something else you think would make a good video on our channel we making these videos a lot them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank [music] you
