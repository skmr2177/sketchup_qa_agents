##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: ambient occlusion inside sketchup [new in 2024] video id: 7qf8v4a1ygs playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qf8v4a1ygs downloaded: 2025-07-18t15:29:13.868091 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- kind: captions y'all! my name is tyson, and let's talk about&nbsp; built-in real-time one-checkbox ambient occlusion. [music] so, if you already know what ambient&nbsp; occlusion is, you should be very excited,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you don't know what ambient occlusion&nbsp; is we're going to show you,and you should be&nbsp;&nbsp; very excited. it is a‚Äîbrand new to this 2024&nbsp; release‚Äîstyle attribute that will give you&nbsp;&nbsp; some incredible depth, an incredible&nbsp; kind of built-in real-time rendering&nbsp;&nbsp; capabilities. it's super cool! nothing &nbsp; actually showing it off, so let's jump in. so, this is a typical‚Äîwhat we might expect from&nbsp; sketchup, right? and we can turn shadows on&nbsp;&nbsp; and etc. etc. let's open up styles and just&nbsp; edit whatever we've got going on here. now,&nbsp;&nbsp; under styles we have the typical&nbsp; edges, but now, under faces,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is this check box, and if we click this:&nbsp; ambient occlusion. all of a sudden you can see that what it does is it gives sort of the&nbsp; space between surfaces a sort of a shading.&nbsp;&nbsp; let's look at this, let's look at this in a&nbsp; different way, right? i'm orbiting around,&nbsp;&nbsp; ambient occlusion is still on, eh? so fun.&nbsp; let me draw a simple‚Äîlet's just ‚Äîdraw a box. and as i draw this, you can see that all of the corners here have this&nbsp; kind of shading to them. and all this is is two&nbsp;&nbsp; sliders that we have options to control this. the&nbsp; distance. so you can see how sort of the distance&nbsp;&nbsp; in those corners grows, and if you push this all&nbsp; the way you get more of a general surface shading.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the intensity which, of course, turns up how&nbsp; deep or how dark to make that ambient occlusion shading. and as you saw, this is real-time. and it's that easy. there's not much more to&nbsp; say other than, "how amazing is this?!" so,&nbsp;&nbsp; let me grab this. let me just get rid of it, and&nbsp; let's have a look at a few of the default styles&nbsp;&nbsp; that are built-in with ambient occlusion, and&nbsp; then maybe we'll play around and create one or&nbsp;&nbsp; two of our own. if we come up to select, now there&nbsp; is an ambient occlusion section here under styles,&nbsp;&nbsp; and let's just have a look at a&nbsp; few of these. this is sort of ‚Äî i don't know what to call it ‚Äî obviously kind&nbsp; of a golden-toned little sketchy style. so you&nbsp;&nbsp; can just jump into some of these and tweak your&nbsp; way through them, or you can easily add it to&nbsp;&nbsp; any existing style. so if we jump over here to&nbsp; default styles, and let's say we take this one&nbsp;&nbsp; but let's turn it to hidden. so we have no&nbsp; texture showing, and let's edit it. in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; what would happen if we turn edges off&nbsp; entirely? right? nothing's going on. but&nbsp;&nbsp; let's turn on ambient occlusion. and we get this&nbsp; lovely shading and a lot of depth in the model.&nbsp;&nbsp; let's take this and combine it with‚Äî let's add&nbsp; profile edges, but just with an attribute of '1'. and maybe make these profile edges more of a&nbsp; light gray so that they're not standing out,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just a little bit of edges. how fun is that?&nbsp; and then just keep going from there. do we want&nbsp;&nbsp; shading? do we want textures? do we want to have a&nbsp; little more of the ambient occlusion effect here? so you can you get the idea. it's something that's&nbsp; going to interact with any of the models you&nbsp;&nbsp; create. it's this shading that's going to happen&nbsp; between surfaces coming together. go out there&nbsp;&nbsp; and try it! that's really all there is to it. it's&nbsp; just so, so cool. i'm very excited to see new and&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful images coming out of your sketchup&nbsp; models! this is going to be fun, and i don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know... i want to show more, but that's as much&nbsp; as there is. it's just that easy and that amazing! really quick to show, part of the new sketchup&nbsp; 2024. give it a try! with us some of your&nbsp;&nbsp; most beautiful images, and i want to give a quick&nbsp; shout-out to our dev team. a feature this&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes it feels it's unique to ,&nbsp; "oh, they've just been building this for the&nbsp;&nbsp; past couple of months." but in fact, especially&nbsp; this sort of thing where it's underlying rendering&nbsp;&nbsp; engine performance, this has probably been in&nbsp; development for multiple release cycles. and&nbsp;&nbsp; you've seen some aspects of performance ability&nbsp; and speed, other things, but it's finally enabled&nbsp;&nbsp; the team to create this beautiful new rendering&nbsp; option that's just built-in. huge shout-out to&nbsp;&nbsp; the dev team for this amazing new feature and&nbsp; all the work that goes into every one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; releases. there's a lot more under the hood&nbsp; than often we see. i'm excited about this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you all! let us know what you think! please&nbsp; jump into the forums and some of the images&nbsp;&nbsp; you create with this new ambient occlusion&nbsp; style. thanks y'all. we'll see you next time [music]
