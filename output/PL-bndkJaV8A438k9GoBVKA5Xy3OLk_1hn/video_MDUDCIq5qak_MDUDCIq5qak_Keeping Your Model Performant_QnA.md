##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdudciq5qak uploader: sketchup duration: 851 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:16:11.058312 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i'm going to give you a couple tips on how to keep your models light and performant so we've done videos this multiple times we do them i actually they're pretty probably pretty regular um one of the things that sketchup will let you do is it will let you make a model that is difficult to work with it will let you download furniture and and import big imagery and and put a bunch of stuff in your model that makes it so it in theory looks nice but is so difficult to use the file size is so huge that it has a hard time working so i wanted to touch on two or three things that you can do to keep your model performant and if you do these things you shouldn't have problems with you know a model that won't rotate or takes several minutes to open or anything that so let's take a look right now all right so i have a model here and if i try to rotate i don't know if you are seeing that but it's it's choppy it's jumping as i as i as i spin around it's not so big if you get your model too big and you start animating components turn into black boxes and that kind of stuff and it it gets kind of kind of yucky but uh this has some stuff going on if this file is bigger than it should be and it's not the geometry if i if i zoom in here and look at the geometry on these these uh doors of this container they're they're not crazy detailed right this is a decent level of detail for this kind of model i have some round stuff so i mean i do have some extra faces here and but it's not crazy it's not out of control the sides of this are super look at that super slim super tight um not a ton of geometry this is not a ridiculous model i mean some models you know if i'm using circles with a hundred sides or something ridiculous that then i could see why this would be choppy but as it stands there's just a handful of things that are they're causing this to be big and i'm i'm illustrating the the little bit of drag as i orbit but there's other issues that come along too right is uh newer versions of sketchup do have more compact files than they used to but it is still possible to get a file that is big too big hard hard to transfer around um we're not quite there with this but but it's possible we could see that from here um and i just want to touch on a handful of things that might help keep your file size down so first thing i mean one thing i do want to mention on this isn't this isn't about file size or or making your model more uh you know easier to open that kind of thing but as far as orbiting this right here profiles is one of the things that kills kills models quickly profiles what profiles does is it just says okay lines that are in the middle are going to be thin and lines around the outside edge will be slightly thicker it's even hard to tell on here that that's on because it's only the edge lines are only twice as wide as the the field edges um but what happens is every time i orbit sketchup has to go check again and goes okay which line is on the edge now which line is on the edge now which signs that so it's constantly checking your model to see which line should be drawn with the profile 2 as opposed to default profile of one turning off profiles you can see you can see the difference right see those those hard line the darker lines um personally i mean i'd be totally asked you i the look of sketchup but i modeling without profiles i think it ends up looking cleaner and lighter uh so i generally do most of my work without profiles so that's one tip that's one thing turn profiles off especially if you have a big model the other thing and i'm gonna zoom in here and show you what i'm talking about so i got some plants in here some of you already know where i'm going but if i show hidden so i'm gonna get a bunch of extra lines and that again is going to cause a slowdown to my animation because again sketchup draws what's on the screen so you can see that also the further out you pull the more it slows down as you zoom in you may hit this barrier rawson boom you zoom fast but having extra edges on versus off sketchups can be more performant when your hidden stuff is hidden and when you show all those edges all right speaking of these good looking plants they're they're nice they're they're i don't wanna i don't complain about it but they contain a ton of geometry okay this plant right here contains more geometry than the whole rest of the model so this is not a simple fix there is not a a button in sketchup that says make this one thing more performant what you will want to do is when you are importing entourage into your model use 3d warehouse that's what it's there for it's awesome it is a great place to go get resources but pay attention to what you're downloading in 3d warehouse you have the ability to view and even you know i could actually go in so if i look at this right here i pick on it it's going to tell me there are a quarter million polygons in this if these are just little pieces that are accent pieces there's no reason to put a quarter million extra polygons into your model this isn't huge either there are models up here that have two three times this geometry if it's a hero piece if you're doing a render of this model this makes a lot of sense but as a little piece it's adding some color probably not the right thing to have there so when you're in 3d warehouse you do have the ability here to say well i don't want a big heavy thing in fact i want to keep it down to yeah two thousand what do you what do i got for a hanging plant with 2 000 faces oh look at this hanging spider plant 274 this is one one thousandth of this the geometry so that's out there that's an option that is one of the two biggest things that happens in models where people oh my model's so huge or it's not performing there's two things i look for that is that is probably number one big ugly geometrically intense models downloaded from warehouse and that's not to say these are bad models these are great models but again depending on what so if this is i'm trying to render something this and i can barely see these things is it worth having a majority of the geometry in my entire model dedicated to these things probably not another thing that ends up being a big issue is materials so as you put in materials so if i import materials i imported you know leaves for this which came in with the model from 3d warehouse i may have created custom colors for this you know this the specific green or this orange or maybe i pulled in grass fire that came in um as i pull in materials you do want to be conscious of the file you pull in or of of the of the size of the the images you pull in so what do i mean by that well each of these everything that everything that's not white on here has either a color or a material associated with it if it's has a material associated with it that file so if it's a a jpeg you pulled in this fire is a perfect example so i pulled in a picture of a fire and i put it in this fireplace that picture that image of the fire is saved as the jpeg file into my model so as you put in more and more materials more and more images are being imported they are being added to your model that's not a bad thing it's it's good i mean sketchup lets you create some really good looking models that way but you do have to be conscious of how big they are so we are talking level up sketchup but i'm going to talk about one extension real quick and that is an extension called material resizer material sizer is an extension is available from sketchup so we actually our team our extensibility team created this and what it will do is it'll run through your whole model and it will tell you how big each material that's been imported is so as i look at this we have a bunch of materials that are it makes sense they're a little you know picture of foliage whatever no big deal but up here i have some that are really big so here's a here's a picture of a leaf is a picture of a single leaf and it is 2300 by 3 400 pixels not the end of the world this is not not a ridiculous uh amount but it is a lot for maybe that big of a leaf you could probably drop again depends what you're using it for if i'm rendering the sleeve okay that makes sense green right here this is a swatch of this green color and it's 8 000 by 8 000 pixels that i'm gonna go ahead and call that ridiculous that is totally unnecessary if i'm using a color i shouldn't be importing it to begin with but the fact that i have this and it's that big is taking that much memory or that much space in my file that's terrible this extension right here material resizer will let you take any files you think are too big say how big do you want them and then you just hit go and then what it will do is it'll run through the model and it will resize each of the selected images so it is less than that material so what that did was that ended up saving space in your model all right one last thing i want to mention and we mentioned this a lot but everybody always gets or we always find somebody who watches these videos or sees these comments in the forum and gets excited that is purging so if you go to window and you click model info uh and then click on the statistics tab over here it's going to tell you everything that's in this model right so here's here's all the stuff that's in here edges faces components guides everything now the thing about sketchup is it holds on the things you pull the model even if they're not part of the modeling window so if i come over here and close styles and pull up components and look at what's in this model so let's let's do this too let's let's get some thumbnails let's close this let's make this bigger so it's going to show me all the things that are in here so if i look at this i look at this model right here um i've got sumelli in here but i don't actually see her in the model uh i've got heather i've got some other some indoor ficus i don't know what that is here's my model of these these three components and then i have some other pieces so i have multiple pieces here if i looked at my colors there remember i was looking at my color window before uh so if i pull my paint bucket back up um i have a lot of materials here i don't actually know if every one of these is being used and sketchup saves them even if they're not in the actual model so if you add a color here it's going to stay here this this mauve color i might actually be using anywhere but it's saved as part of the model same with these components indoor ficus i downloaded it and didn't it it's still saved in the model so what purge does if i go into model info statistics i have this button called purge unused if i click that it's going to run through the model with on my screen and it's going to say okay everything here is accounted for anything that's not here in the actual model itself out that doesn't mean stuff is turned off if it's in the model and it's on a tag that's toggled off or it's hidden something that it'll stay in the model but if it's not if it's not actively being used anywhere in the model it'll go away so i'm gonna go ahead and run it it's hard to i mean just keep an eye out let's see what happens here um oh do you see that look it have it over here i had four components go away let's bring our paint bucket so remember that that was overflowing off the edge so a bunch of colors went away too so purge is huge if you use 3d warehouse a lot you may have a model full of 3d 3d warehouse models that you're not actually using and purge can do things cut in half or even down 25 of your file size by getting rid of all that extra content that's being saved in the model so keeping these things in mind is going to help you create models that are snappy easy to use and you know don't take multiple minutes to open or save or anything that i don't know if you've ever run in this model some people are really really vigilant modelers and they always you know keep track of everything
