##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at modeling some sliding doors sliding doors bypass sliders i'm trying to think other names you know it's it's it's the situation where you have an opening and larger than normal opening usually maybe a double sized opening and you have not one door slab but multiple door slabs that move past each other um this done with lots of doors you can have i don't know i've seen doors with 10 panels that that open you know uh slide past each other we're just going to do two we're going to look at uh modeling a basic interior and exterior door we're do that right now okay so i have a couple of walls here this is going to be my interior the thinner shorter wall with a slightly smaller opening and over here we have a taller wider wall with a bigger opening so both these are grouped to begin with all right so um i'm going to model what uh something that i have in in my own house which is so here i have a let's see how tall how big is this this this opening is 410 so we're going to put uh a couple of doors in here i'm going to start from the center i'm going to draw a line right here and i'm going to come across if i come right to the center you have a 25 there but a 2ot five slab would not overlap with the next piece at all so we're going to go 2 and 1/2 foot so i'm going to go 2 fo 6 and i'm going to go straight up to the center of this i'm just hit my up arrow key to lock that i'm going to bring it over here and i'm going to drop that down there we go and then that door is going to pull this way one inch all right so there's my that is my initial slab for this door i'm going to triple click and i'm going to make this a component and just going to call interior door in this model simple enough all right now i'm going to take that and there's some depending on the amount of detail i put in here i could spend an entire session just talking about the rail and the the wheel that hangs down all that stuff to actually make this slide um i'm not going to do that i'm going to keep this fairly simple this going to look good uh in my model but that's about it um i'm going to come in here and i'm going to put in a little just a little handle kind of thing a place where i can just just pushed in maybe a half an inch or so so i could actually open this door uh i'm going to do that slightly below the center so i'm going to come over here at the center i'm drawing out of context right now that is intentional so i'm going to come over 2 in and then i'm going to drop down i don't know 3 in and i'm going to come over just a you know a little something that um you know what let's do this let's round the tops of these i'm trying to think of details i've seen on different doors so there i'm going to take a a shape that and i'm just going to push it into the surface half an inch so i'm going to grab that command x i'm going to double click into the door paste in place that's going to put that in there and i'm just going to push it in . five oops see how i got those little lines right there i can get rid of that by triple clicking or double clicking excuse me right click and then weld edges then when i push it in5 i don't get that uh those edges because the outline is welded all right so there there i have my slab i need two of those of course so i'm going to take this one i'm going to option copy it right here right now i'm i'm in line with that that's not going to work of course um it also has my my handles on the same side that's not going to work so one of the things i'm going to do i'm going to just bring this out here i'm going to scale i'm going to scale right around the middle that and i'm just going to scale to minus one it's going to snap there there we go so now we have the same slab and this is important because if i come in here and i grab say this door handle and i move it around see both of them are going to move the same so i don't have to make just because it's opposite i can scale it inverted that and that still works so i'm going to try and move this as simple as possible i'm going to line it up that and then it needs to come in so i'm going to slide it over there we go i'm slide it right back click right there all right now they properly overlap now depending on the look and feel and how i mean they do make uh sliding hardware that sits up into the top of the wall into the the casement um this could be done depending on the reality of the situation you might actually have a piece that hangs down and then the the hanging hardware is up here so maybe we again i'm just throwing out ideas here uh i might come out here a couple inches and then maybe i have some kind of a something this uh maybe i have a piece that sits this just a piece of trim above something that uh that might sit on there i might actually have a full casement i actually have pieces that go all the way around it really depends on the detail of your your the look and feel i guess i should say of your architectural model but there we go so pretty simple um we didn't put any smarts in this i didn't use dynamic components or anything that that's something else we could consider but there's a a quick and easy interior uh slider so on an exterior slider we're going to go a little bit further because we're going to have to create you know it's going to have this pocket that the whole thing's going to work inside of um so i'm going to i'm going to detail that out real quick so i'm going to say it looks something this it's going to come out here it's going to come this it's going to go this way uh that and then come in this um yeah something that i'm going to draw half of it then i will take this piece and just mirror that oops wrong piece mirror that right there all right so i'm going to take something that this is i might the interior and exterior might be slightly different um but i'm going to take that and i am going to trace it around that so i'm going to take this is my path this square right here so i'm going to say me with this shape right here now obviously this isn't going to be perfect because i don't want that coming down oops i did something wrong oh i cut that that's why that won't work because when i put this edge here it broke this so here's what i'm going to do easy enough fix i'm going to take that i'm going to slide it with a copy up get rid of this this get rid of that get rid of that that that that that that that that that all all the other that'ss go away then there's an extra edge here here and here there we go so now my my profile that i want to put around is on here so if i click this i got my profile or my my path i want to then i click my profile there we go now it goes all the way around there i can see that looks good i got a little channel there um i can get rid of this face obviously the bottom's not quite perfect because i'm not going to have trim down there so all i'm going to do in that case is just push pull that up flush dou click here and there we go got something that for my exterior frame and then the next piece i mean well i should probably make this a group let's make that a group i don't have to make it a component it's not going to com well actually what i would probably do is get my doors in here and then grab the whole thing and make it component all right now depending on a lot of stuff right now comes down to how this is going to be built so again i'm going to draw my next slab not to the center but just past that so i'm going to say 3 foot1 something that and depending on your slider i might have one or two actual sliding doors so this one piece may actually be static um or it may move uh depends on on the thing so i'm going to go ahead and i'm just going to offset this and we're say this is a gl got glass in it or something that so i'm going to come two ines all right and then i'm just going to push it all the way through right now all right make a component at this point exterior door uh and then if i look at this uh actually i want to get a little bit more uh meat on this frame it looks a little a little timid all right there we go something that and then i might draw a rectangle right in the middle to represent glass again how much detail you want to go in here do you want to draw width in your glass that sort of thing that's up to you but uh that's good enough for me i'm going to just color that with a default glass material glass grab something thing here that's transparent i this blue whoops i did the whole thing that's not going to work i'm go into context just the middle we go and then uh i can do then is see here's the other thing i could do again depending on if this is a single slide if this is not moving then i'm probably not going to put a a door handle on here but if i have something where both pieces can move past each other then i might actually want to come in here and put my hardware in um i'm going to do the same thing i did before let's go ahead and just grab this option slide it over here and then we can grab this and shift slide that all the way back into that slot and there we go there they they lap over each other and then the last thing to consider here i was saying would be the handle or hardware how how does this how does one grab onto this and open it so i'm going to do something i'm going to make something up i know that sounds hard to believe but uh i'm going to come in here and i'm going to do something on the glass where maybe i have a uh a section of the door here i don't know something this i'm going to pull this out this a little bit so it actually sits out on the door maybe i'll round off these corners double click to round off exactly the same on both something that something that then uh that back up and get rid of it and again here and i don't know maybe do something this i'm i'm making stuff up but there's but however i get a handle on here or erase these edges because i could have again i did with the other thing i could have welded that first and that would have prevented happen so i get a handle here that's the point is i got a handle here but you can see i had the same problem over here because what i didn't do with this is i did not scale it and invert it so let's do that real quick right now c right here 1 that almost worked that worked and has on the same side but because i would want this door on this handle on the other door i' have to scale this way as well about the middle to minus one there we go and obviously i'm learning it um so there we go so now i have a slider that i could oops i'd want to slide that along the axis want stay on the axis there but there we go now i have a sliding door that opens up the trim casement is all one piece at this point too i would probably grab all these pieces right click and make this a new component i can't talk while i type i don't know if you have that same issue but it's a it's a birth issue i've always had it create that okay and there we go now i have my slider component so i could take that use it multiple times across the the job or my model and i have my interior i didn't do the same thing here but i could do this i could grab these and make that into a new component [music] interior bypass there we go two sliding doors in uh what was that about 12 13 minutes so i know i'm going to see comments about how people the bu the bypasses or sliders they use look different than this or they never have this or the interior trim doesn't look that or i yeah that's awesome cool you model yours and make it perfect the way that you need to see it for your job the way your hardware works go for it hopefully you see this and
