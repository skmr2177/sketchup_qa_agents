##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here today i want to with you a quick and easy way to add annotations or markups directly into your sketchup model okay so the first question to ask ourselves is why might we need to add markups straight into sketchup and i think the obvious answer is that we can always do a screen capture we can always then it up and then send something as a 2d jpeg but everything sketchup's ability to retain information in 3d to be able to rotate around use scenes that's going to be really helpful because imagine working collaboratively where we have multiple people and you need to say to somebody this needs to go here now you might not be the one making that change or you might not want to make that change but you can make that suggestion and it's really cool to be able to go in the model make a markup and then let the designer or the modeler make those changes that you want to see and then also be able to track them again right there in your model so i'm going to show you how to do that using a new feature in 2023 called overlays so let's go ahead and just get to it so i've got my model here you might recognize this if you took our campus course on commercial interiors then you've probably seen this hopefully build this yourself um in this case i'm just using it as an example let's pretend this model is ready to be reviewed by our design teams that's what i want to do here i want to just say okay take a review let me know your thoughts don't make the changes yet just it up and then as the designer i'll go in and make those changes myself so first thing i want to do is explain a little bit of information about overlays if you don't know what they are it's a little bit technical because it's meant for the developers actually it's part of the back end so i'm going to click over here on window overlays again this is new to 2023 so if you're using an older version you're not going to get this so now that i've got this overlays panel here you can see what it does is it tells you which extensions use overlays so in a way overlays are native to sketchup but what they're doing is they're allowing you to add information to extensions so it's it's being able to run the extension and be able to display information while you're modeling so it's kind of expanding the capabilities of what we're already doing so there's a little bit more information to say about how and why and some of the advantages of working with overlays but that's not the core point that's just kind of the information i want to kind of explain because really what we want to do is annotate our model if you're not sure where to get these extensions that use overlays you can click discover more i'm going to close that i don't need that and right now there's only a few out but i can see this being used more and more as developers really understand the potential to be able to display more information while you're modeling so that therefore you're just you know you're expanding again the capabilities of what we're already doing so i'm treating this as kind of a native sketchup tool rather than an extension because a little bit if you come up over here to tool palettes we've got solid tools a lot of people don't think of those as sort of your core tools because they're not in the main toolbar sometimes people think sandbox kind of functions a little bit an extension right but it kind of free floats in its own little world well that's the way i'm kind of treating annotations so once you've installed the annotations extension you can come up over here to draw and then under annotations we've got two kinds of annotations to choose from we can do model annotations which put the line work or the feedback right in the model or we can do screen annotations and i'll show you the difference between them let's start with model annotations if i wanted to draw something let me just kind of pan around i'll try not to get stuck in a wall or call them but i'm just going to kind of pan around and let's just say for example this pool table it needs to shift over for some reason i mean it's perfectly centered but maybe what we need to do or maybe the tile on the ground needs to edit so we want to do is come over here and make an annotation i'm just going to draw it with my mouse and i'm just going to kind of draw that area and i say this tile you know we've got to get rid of this tile we actually need to bring this wood over here so we're going to lose that tile and we're going to replace that with wood now the cool thing here is if i rotate around you can see what happened it's kind of a visual trick it looked i drew straight across but what it did is it the annotation recognizes the geometry and it goes up and over it now i can't select the annotation itself the annotation is an overlay so it's just being displayed it's not actually creating any geometry in the model it's not going to make your model heavy or anything that but here's the the the thing if i come back over here to perspective my perspective that i started at you can see that that annotation that i drew was keyed to a seam so it doesn't really make sense to view it from over here what i might want to do instead is come over here first so before i draw the annotation so before i make the annotation um actually i'm just going to come up here i'm going to just clear those annotations erase annotations so i'm just going to clear those out depending on how many i have i can erase them one at a time here having trouble getting that one but that's okay just zoom in fix that so in this case what i would want to do is probably set up a scene first and maybe that's going to be called something markup or annotations or whatever you want to call it comments doesn't matter so now when i draw annotations model annotations so now if i was to sit there and say no that needs to go away i'm going to cut that out that's gone i want to make sure that that's replaced with wood now if i come over here and i pop back to my previous scene it disappears those annotations aren't there anymore so when i come in my markup scene there they are and the nice thing about that is that because of that perspective it's actually really important that you tie it to a scene you don't have to but it kind of works that way the other thing reason why you want to up a scene a separate scene rather than doing it on its own is because in this case you saw me when i wanted to do it again i went to up here to draw annotations erase but it doesn't erase all of them it lets you choose which ones you want to erase so in that case i can erase the whole boundary i'm going to undo that if i want to get rid of if i had a bunch of annotations i could actually come over here and just delete the scene so if i delete that scene click yes i want to get rid of that what it's going to do is it's going to get rid of that scene and then therefore all the annotations with it are gone so let me show you the one more this is pretty simple extension so i mean that's pretty much most of it but there's one more option you can do which is called screen annotations so you know the way that i just did that did it on the floor and over the pool table and it kind of went up and over the pool table that because it's actually drawing on the geometry in this case if i wanted to do something i'll just do it from here instead of just creating a new scene if i want to do something that and i say no we got to get rid of the pool table unfortunately it's not in our budget we want to get rid of this tile we're not going to need that anymore and we want to put this wood over here now when i rotate in this case watch what happens this time if i zoom in and rotate you can see that i've lost the it's no longer tied to the geometry it's actually tied to the screen so it floats now that works almost better for if you're doing call outs if you wanted to put something a note that floats in which case it's actually kind of independent of the geometry so you can use these two together if i go back to my perspective lounge there it is now i didn't create a new scene so now it's tied to this scene so i can either delete this scene or i can go and erase them manually i'm just going to go ahead and come back over here since i didn't create a new scene i'm just going to erase those annotations don't really need those i was just for this demo here and that last one there we go now we're back so that was pretty quick a pretty quick um kind of a overview of not just overlays kind of what an overlay is and how it works and why it's unique to 2023 right because that this actually technology came from the ipad app some people probably are thinking well you know that's cool that you've got an ipad app but i'm a desktop user but the now that we have the two of those when we learn something when something works really well on the ipad we can actually take that feedback we can take those tools and incorporate them that's what's happening here it started as an ipad drawing tool because you're using the pen and you're able to draw right on the screen and we said this is really useful actually we're going to bring that in in 2023 into the desktop of the pro or desktop version of the app so that's pretty cool that there's this feedback loop now that the two of them are actually getting tighter and tighter more integrated so whether use the ipad app and you do it that way or whether you're doing it on the desktop app now you don't need to do a screenshot and go to something photoshop you can just make your annotations right there in the model those with other other people get those changes and that feedback incorporated and you know keep going with your design so i want to say that's it don't forget to and and i'll say twice because i read these comments below um i'll interact with you i'll respond to you have you used this feature had to use it in your firm or personal work let me know give it i'd learn from you as much as i want to pass my knowledge on i want to learn also from people who actually do use this feature day to day if you haven't give it a try it's super easy it's super fun to play with and you know we'll go from there so i'll say thanks there and see you next time foreign foreign
