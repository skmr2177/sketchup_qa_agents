##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: how to 3d model a hot dog in sketchup üå≠ video id: 3e4dpdmnhik playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e4dpdmnhik uploader: sketchup duration: 988 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:08:24.026421 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- hot dog. in this tutorial, i'm going to show how i 3d modeled this low poly hot dog in sketchup. and when i did the condiments, i learned a couple things myself. so, stick around for those. and uh let's get into [music] it. usually in these videos, this is where we provide context. it's a hot dog, so there's not too much context. it could be a veggie dog. uh i guess that's some context there. but, uh yeah, that's pretty much it. so, let's get into the modeling part. i'll make a new file here and then um because i want that low poly faceted look um i'm going to use polygons instead of circles for this. so i'll um go to the polygon uh 12s for 12 sides is good and then uh the left arrow key to lock it to the green axis and i will just make it a 1 inch uh radius. and we can say goodbye to tomtom for this. and i'll do shift z to uh zoom just to the extents of our uh of our polygon here. and i'll push pull this out 6 in. um it's kind of bunlike. uh but to make it a little more uh a bun, i'll select it all and then scale it down. um just squash it a little bit to make it a little bit more look a bun. uh that's about right. and um let's see. i'm going to make a couple guides here just to help me out. so the tape measure tool. and then i'll make a guide from here, here across here, and here. um, and the first thing i'll do is make uh from this kind of second to bottom end point here across to the middle just up a bit and then down to the other side and then push this across to the back. triple click all this to select it and then move it uh with a copy. that's option on mac. and then in the bottom here, you can see where the uh where the copy modifier is on windows. uh and i'll just move it over 4 in. um what i'm going to do is make a kind of a a cutter uh to to cut out the inside of this bun from the outside. uh what these guides do is just kind of make sure that stuff lines up so it's a little cleaner for the low poly look. uh so i'll go to the the line tool here and go from this uh vertex and just down and in a little bit and then straight down and kind of across a little bit and then down to this midpoint. uh from here i can go edit delete guides and then go ahead and select all these uh different pieces here. and i'm going to go to the flip tool and again with that modifier to make a copy about the center. um great. i'll push pull this all the way to the end just to get rid of it. and then i'm gonna push these out some arbitrary amount. doesn't matter. uh because this is the thing that we're going to be use to cut our bun. um so i'll triple click all that to select it and make it a group. that's fine. okay. um now to make our bun a little bit more bun- shaped, what i'm going to do is use pushpull with the modifier key. uh option toggle create new starting face here. uh, and i'm going to push this out a little bit. and then i'm going to scale it down. um, and using the about center. i think the only modifier key i've used this entire time is option on mac. i don't know what the windows equivalent is, but um, staying consistent with the modifier keys here. and then i'll do that one more time. same thing. and scale it down there to make it. it's kind of bunny, right? um, okay. and then, uh, what we're going to do is we're going to navigate to the side here. delete this face. so, when i did that pushpull and create a new starting face, uh, it made it interior faces here. and it's just we need to get rid of those. and then when you can see that geometry on the inside, that's how you know, actually, delete this back one too. um that there's no interior faces, which will be important for what we do uh next. so, i'll use a line just to close this up. and then i'll navigate over here to the side of this bun-shaped object and a left to right selection just to select only these pieces of the end. um and flip again uh with the modifier about the center of this to make that over here. i will triple click all this and make that a group. and here in entity info, you can see that's a solid group. that's important. um because what we're going to do is take this piece, move it back 4 in so it overlaps, and then i'm going to use uh two different ways to do this. so, solid tools is included in any paid version of sketchup. and so, uh, i'll show you how to use that first. so, um, you can go to tools, solid tools, subtract, and then i'll select i want to subtract this from this. and it just kind of cuts that right out from the middle of our bun. okay, great. um, but i'll back up and show that if you don't have the paid versions, this is how you would do that. so, once i have those overlapping, i'm going to select both of these and hit explode. and then when everything's still selected here, i'll rightclick and say intersect faces with model. and that will create intersections at each of the pieces uh where the faces overlapped. so there will be some cleanup here um that solid tools, you know, kind of takes care of automatically, but we'll have to go in and delete the extra the excess um pieces here. so, if i can just go down the barrel. i'll hit x for x-ray just so i can try to see this. and then select just this interior geometry to try to clean it up. and here that i mean, i knew hot dogs were messy, but not this kind of messy, you know? i thought it was more the ketchup and stuff could get on your pants, cause some issues, but um who would have known? and i'll turn x-ray mode off. and you can see we end up with pretty much the same result. i'll actually right click on uh one of these white faces. so this on the inside here, this is the interior face. so i will just uh orient faces. and then i can select all this and say make a group. okay, nice. we have our bun. um, now what i'll do is make the hot dog itself. so, um, i'm going to draw a piece of reference geometry just to make sure i hit the center here from here over to here. and again, i'm going to use the polygon tool. um, and i'm going to hit the left arrow to do it on the green again. and one thing that's uh important for what i'm about to do next is make sure that the um you do the modifier key, the circumscribed is what i want um to do the next operation. so make sure it's circumscribed, meaning that your cursor is on that kind of the flat edge of that uh polygon coming out. and we'll pull it out to, you know, it's not a huge hot dog. i want it to fit in the bun. but um maybe here. and i can go ahead and delete that piece. i'll push this out. these are bun length certainly. uh and apparently very plump, but that's the kind of hot dogs i for sure. um so you have this uh one here. and i'm going to use uh the pie tool to make the the edge of this. [music] um come in. so, i'll actually delete this face right now. and then i will go to my pi tool and uh hit 3s to make three sides. we're doing low poly after all. and i'm going to hover over the edge of this just to try to infer the center of that polygon. then hit the up arrow to uh start from the center on the blue axis and go click once to start and let's see 90. so that's good. um select that polygon itself and then i can go to the me tool and the polygon. uh let me just make sure there's no yep. okay, that should be all good. and then um i'm going to select all this hot dog geometry. you don't want really want loose geometry in your model. so i'll triple click to select all that. make that a group and double click to go in. and then i'm going to go view uh component edit, hide rest of model. uh so i'm going to do the same thing that i did with the the edge of the bun. uh, select the end, flip, make a copy, and there we have our hot dog. so, uh, now i'm actually going to select both of these, uh, just to soften them, make them look a little more, um, appetizing. and i'm going to navigate to the very top to do the ketchup and mustard. i'm going to go to the freehand tool. and i don't know if i'm you, but whenever i put ketchup and mustard on a hot dog, i want it to be the nicest looking ketchup and mustard. i want this to be this could be on the front page of, you know, hot dog digest. um, so anyways, i'll use the freehand tool and just go on the hot dog and draw as if i'm drawing with my nice um uh i was going to say hot dog dispenser. uh, you know, a bottle of ketchup. oops. this is what i always accidentally did. so, okay, let's back up. do the freehand tool. we put our ketchup art on here. and then without backing out of the tool, what you're going to do is uh look in this bottom corner and option minus is what it is on mac. and if i do minus uh without backing out of the freehand tool and staying within the tool, it will reduce the number of segments. um it's low poly after all, so we want to reduce the number of segments. um so that's good. i'll go back into the select tool and i'll actually select that line itself because simplifying it kind of brought it inside the hot dog here which is not what we want. so i'll select that line and actually make that a group. and then when i double click into that you can actually see what we what we drew here. so i'll come over to the side and it's low poly but it's still on top of the hot dog. great. um i'm going to do a me to to make the the ketchup here. and one thing if you're familiar with the me tool is that you want to have your shape the path at a perpendicular angle. and if i did do a circle on this, you know, i could lock it to the green or the red or the blue, but it wouldn't really definitely wouldn't be perpendicular to this. one way to uh to draw perpendicular is using the pi tool. uh this was my revelation when i was uh practicing this video. so i'll actually make this five sides. and if you click and drag and then go along that first segment of your uh your me path here and then let go and then um draw click once to start and then say uh it's asking for an angle. so, i'll do 360 degrees, which goes all the way around. and then that will that's a little large. i'll actually scale that. okay. so, actually, i'm going to back up and do the same thing again. click, drag, and i'll start it a little bit smaller. look, i a lot of ketchup, but not that much. 360. enter. and now um then select my path. me. select the face. select all this and uh change this slider just so i do get that um that faceted look here. and backing out. [music] um okay. it's a little bit of trial and error. that was had the ketchup going into the hot dog. so, what i'm going to do actually is grab this, move it by this bottom, and stick it right on the edge because i know this is still perpendicular, which is good. um, now when i select that, me, and this, then it'll be on top of my hot dog in a low poly way, the whole way. and beautiful, everybody's happy. um, i'm going to use the flip again with a copy, but just do it uh without moving this um the plane just from the center here with the uh modifier. there we go. and let's get some materials on this thing to make it true hot dog status. it kind of look shoring french fries. maybe i should have done a little bit larger. uh, ketchup and mustard, but we can do that later. so, uh, mustard. great. ketchup. yes. hot dog. bingo. and bun. it's a nice slight bun. oh, i missed the the ketchup one. okay, there we go. we've got our hot dog. and i'll actually select all this and make it a group now. keep all those pieces together. and um let me pop over to this and put hot dog on a plate here. so there you have it. it's ready. it's picnic time uh here on the sketchup youtube channel. yummy. um kind of fumbled my way through it there, but we got some some hot dogs made fresh off the grill for you. so uh is there a different way you would do this? let me know for sure. um, would you to see other grilled items modeled or anything else uh modeled here in one of these sketchup videos? please let us know in the . uh, if you the video and um, yeah, thanks a lot for watching. we'll see you next time.
