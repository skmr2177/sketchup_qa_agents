##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name's tyson today let's talk about 3d printing so many of you will probably be familiar with this concept but if you have not tried uh 3d printing what we're going to talk about is some tips for taking your sketchup models to 3d printing software and 3d printers and just some general guidelines or considerations that uh that you should keep in mind so let's get to it so the first thing to think about when you are 3d printing is that you want to send a solid object to the 3d printer this is a pretty generic shape but if we look at the end of the info it registers as a solid group now if we went into this and just drew a line that would make it nonsolid now that line probably won't interfere if we actually exported this but there's a lot of things certainly missing faces that will cause problems so just keep in mind that you want to create 3d solid objects just make them groups or components if we look over here for example if i look at the x-ray mode we can see there's some stuff in here extra edges extra surfaces going on various ways to make this a non-solid so in the -up video to this one we'll look at some of the extensions out there such as the solid tools extension that will help clean this up but generally just keep that in mind that you want to create solid objects so that's principle number one pretty straightforward um the principle the second one that i want uh to show let me show that under model info my current uh default units are inches and if i export this as an stl file so if i export as a 3d model stls uh one of the default export options i want to go into the options and make sure that i'm exporting this uh as millimeters most of the software out there slicing software will prefer millimeters if you export as inches it might convert it for you or it might bring it in as uh you know um at the wrong scale because of this so i have found generally this helps just change this to millimeters and then test it out i've already exported this out let's have a look at what this would uh come across as now this is ultimaker cura um i'm not this we're not partnered with them or anything this just happens to be a good allpurpose slicer but any slicer of course will do this same thing so our object is brought in in we could move it around on the bed but ultimately we're just going to slice this now there's a lot of settings in here 3d printing um you can go deep into the weeds based on the materials you to use and and a number of factors let's just create a pretty generic pla4 nozzle slice and then if i preview this is going to give us kind of an idea of how it would build this up from the base and build it up with a lot of interior supports and that's how it would print and it would take nearly six hours for this particular print so let's look go back that's the basics you just take your model you export it as an stl file import it into your slicing software and then slice and send it to your printer now let's look at a few other considerations when you're in sketchup creating a model these are both from some um skill builders that we did in the past few months this one was on a scill builder using boings if i were to create this with the solid tools a number of subtractive and additive boolean functions at this scale there might be some problems as a i build it it might h result in some missing faces and here's another example of that if i took this model and i want to create a little bevel around the base of it so i'm going to select this surface use the me tool okay and i'll do the same in here and this example was from our me and we showed there as well that this is pretty small and there's some gaps in here when you're dealing with really small geometry sketchup doesn't always resolve all of those gaps so you want to keep that in mind as you're building models so let me undo that now there's a couple ways to deal with this um where you scale it up i could scale this object itself larger by a known factor let's say 10 and then i'd scale it back down point .1 but this is a component so i could also just make a copy of it move it over here scale up the outer version of this to anything and then i'm going to come back in here use me and by doing it on this larger version you can see that it actually works just fine but i'll delete that because it was a component it happened also on our uh real scale and it actually resolved it correctly this is commonly referred to as the r method so we you know thanks as always to for sharing this in our forums just remember that if you have a small object and you're having trouble with the details scale a copy of it or a copy of it if it's a component or scale it up by some known factor and then scale it back down but things work better when bigger but you can still make that work for you so that's the uh the idea of go big all right let's talk about nozzle size by default and we're talking about filament fdm type printers here by default printers are going to come with a 04 mimet nozzle that's pretty standard it's a good balance of you can get a print done in a couple hours but also have a fair amount of detail but you can change those out for larger nozzles so a point six or8 nozzle so with that in mind that you can have different nozzle sizes you may want to build your models as some you know close factor of that and in this example i've got all of these boxes in this sort of grid system and the walls of these boxes i've made 1 mm thick and if you think about 04 a04 size nozzle then it will take roughly two beads of plastic to fill a 1 millimeter or at a08 size nozzle i could do it with one and fact that's what we'll see so let's take a look at this i've exported this out as an stl if we come back to our slicing software and ort that box right now i've got a point4 nozzle so if i slice this this box is going to take uh over eight hours to complete and indeed we can see why because it's got to go along each of these walls twice it's got a lot of infill to to do if i instead printed this with a8 nozle now we've cut the time in half and in fact we could go into the the settings here and reduce the amount of of filler and we could get this time down even lower but the main point is that with a one millim wall modeling that then i know i'm going to get you know one bead at 08 nozzle so just keep in mind that that you may want to keep your nozzle size and your modeling size and keep a relationship between them and for some predict some predictability when you come on over here uh and these boxes work fine we won't go into to the weeds of materials pla if you were printing this you might have some concern with separation whereas i've printed some boxes out of petg and had really good success but that goes into the weeds uh the weeds and the fun of 3d printing but there you go keep in mind that you can change the nozzle size of your 3d printer and you know use extrude more or less filament and that you may want to consider that in your model uh window another consideration with nozzle size is how much tolerance uh or how much space you need to create for your models and what i mean is this in this example this is a marker holder for a cnc machine so that this attaches to a cnc and this can move up and down and this holds markers and you can draw um it's not my original idea this is just my version of that idea not only do i want this piece to be able to move in this chamber up and down and we'd put a spring up here but also the print itself is not exact so i want to make sure that the wall of this piece has a little bit of room between the wall of this chamber and again not just for movement but also because the printer is going to have a little bit of variability so this was modeled with a little bit of space and it was modeled with a little bit of space oops here on the top so that once this is enclosed again it has a a little bit space to move here's another example of that if i move this piece in this piece slides in here but you can see it's not meant to touch the bottom here it's meant to have a little bit of space on these sides and then this would be a friction fit that that slides in here so again keep that in mind you need to model if you have interlocking pieces you need to model with some idea that you're creating a little bit of a tolerance because the print sizes are not exactly perfect and that will vary based on the noel nozzle size um again a 08 would give you a little more variance that you'd need to account for whereas a point4 would be a more precise model but of course take more time all right now another concept to think of when you're 3d printing is how you send the file so let's say i've modeled this i could select all of these pieces and send this file over but it would come across something this um this version we can see was broken out a little bit but i if when i exported i selected all of these and exported them as one file now i'm going to have to go through and it treats this as sort of one model and it it's it's kind going to be kind of a hassle to fix this but there's no need because i could simply have from the start either exported these out as separate pieces or laid this out and sketch up this where they're all sitting on the ground and then i could export them all out and import them and that's going to work much better i don't have to fix anything about how this sits on the model another thing that uh you'll become very familiar with as you enter the world of 3d printing is the idea of supports and the idea that you're going to want to orient your pieces to minimize supports so this piece could go to the printer right it's going to be used this where it's vertical but i could take it vertically i could take it this i could take it this and in the printer it's going to have to print supports for all those places that have overhangs so even at a point 8 nozzle let's slice this and in here it's not showing supports let me make sure that under so i'm going to say generate there's settings for how much of that but this is this is what we'd be seeing in order to pro print for example this overhang or the lip under here or this it's going to have to print supports to build up to it and as best you can you will learn to avoid supports not only because it takes more time and material but because you then have to go in and clean all of this out and uh and clean it up so keep it in mind as you're learning to 3d print that you will want to regardless of what your piece is supposed to be at the end which is this version this version is the best one for printing because it has it minimizes supports so i would export it that all right one last concept that we can cover here and then we've dragged it out long enough it's the ide a that often for 3d prints you will create little bevels and that's that's a great that's that's a really nice piece to add when you do you may want to consider whether you are creating angled bevels and chamfers or whether they have a radius and i apologize if i'm using my words a little incorrectly the idea of bevels and chamfers and radius e and all of this but let me show an example of why y keep in mind that for these bevels the you know the slope here is consistent whereas what happens for a radius is the slope starts to be more and more basically of an overhang so when we look at that in our software or as we prepare it for a 3d printer you see what's happening under here is we're getting farther and farther away even um we're being shown that this bead of filament is going to leave a gap here and a gap here and the gaps won't bind together and this this is going to be a problematic area of this print and that doesn't entirely have to be on an overhang it can also be down here as well whereas if we use just a straight uh ramp then we're going to have more consistent results now that's not to say don't ever use a radius it's just to say be aware of this and uh and you may not want to take it all the way or just have other considerations if we had more layers in here that might help remediate that as well just something to be aware of and to experiment with all right that was a whirlwind of throwing different concepts at you hopefully it was helpful though i know we didn't actually take anything to a 3d printer as you saw actual prints take hours to to go but once you export that stl file then you can slice it up and then from there uh run to your 3d printer so many possibilities 3d printing uh opens up it is a lot of fun if you are brand new to it prepare to be frustrated a little bit uh or a lot bit but the barrier to entry really is better now uh than even just a few years ago machines are far more reliable uh the price keeps coming down for better and better machines it's pretty fun but you will do some experimenting based on the type of models you create so just be that you know mentally ready for that with that said let us know um what you think about you know the three printing 3d printing in your own industry or your own world what you use it for um we' love to have that thought let us know if there's other things that you want us to see in these videos and i say hopefully in the next video we will look a little bit at some of the extensions that will help you prepare your models for 3d printing otherwise and if you haven't and as always have a great day we'll see y'all [music] later
