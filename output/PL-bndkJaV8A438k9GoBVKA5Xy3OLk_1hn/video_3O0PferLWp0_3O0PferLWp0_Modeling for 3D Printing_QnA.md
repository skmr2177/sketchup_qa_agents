Here are the Q&A pairs generated based on the provided transcript:

**Q:** What is the main principle to keep in mind when creating 3D models for printing?

**A:** The main principle is to create solid objects, as non-solid models can cause problems during the printing process.

**Q:** How do you handle small gaps or details in your model that don't resolve correctly in SketchUp?

**A:** You can scale up a copy of the component and then scale it back down, or use the Dave R method to create a larger version of the object and then edit it down to size.

**Q:** What is the importance of nozzle size when 3D printing?

**A:** Nozzle size affects print time, detail, and material usage. Smaller nozzles (e.g., 0.4mm) are more precise but take longer, while larger nozzles (e.g., 0.8mm) are faster but may require more filament.

**Q:** How do you minimize supports during the printing process?

**A:** You can orient your pieces to minimize overhangs and use software settings to generate support only where necessary.

**Q:** What is the difference between bevels, chamfers, and radius in 3D modeling for printing?

**A:** Bevels have a consistent slope, while chamfers and radii have varying slopes that can lead to gaps and problematic areas during printing.
