##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: 5 things i got wrong when i started sketchup video id: q0veq64vdoc playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0veq64vdoc uploader: sketchup duration: 790 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:07:53.008389 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , i'm and today i'm going to tell you about the top five things that i did wrong when i started using [music] sketchup. all right, so this is it. this is my opportunity to bear my soul about how flawed i was when i was a new user and how i got things wrong all the time. no longer though. i'm perfect now. no, i'm just kidding. i get things wrong all the time. uh, but when i started, i really got things wrong. so, i didn't appreciate a lot of what sketchup is, how it's done, how it's made. um, i tried to use it other software, and that's that's just a trouble. i mean, it's not those other 3d modeling softwares you've used or 2d modeling softwares, documentation softwares you've used. it is its own thing. um, so there's some things on out there that people don't appreciate. the 3d view inferencing, we've gone over all that kind of stuff. these are specific to me. these are the things that i look back at and i'm , man, if i had jumped on those quicker, i would have been a better sketchup user, even faster. and those are things i want to jump through with you. so, here are this is my personal list of five things that i did wrong when i started using sketchup. let's go. all right. uh, we're going to keep this simple because when i started using sketchup, i modeled very simple things. so, uh, i modeled ambitious things and got myself in a lot of trouble a lot. um, so again, i said, there's there's some things that i just want to kind of throw out there. a lot of people don't appreciate things grouping. if you want to isolate geometry, you know, you want to come in here, make it a group. it's going to keep it separate from other geometry. inferencing. when you go into to draw, watch the colors of the the lines you're drawing as that's going to be inferencing. and then getting those snap points as you move around, end points, midpoints, that kind of stuff. those are things that that people don't appreciate. learning how to orbit real quick. that's that's another one. people get stuck into views and they don't know how to get out of it. those are simple things. those are things that that everybody should learn at the beginning. so, i want to go beyond that and talk about the things that i personally realized at some point had these light bulb moments. the first one is right up here. if i go up to sketchup on on a windows machine, you go to the windows menu and then go to settings and it's right here. shortcuts. i when i started using sketchup, i love toolbars. i was on a windows machine and i went in and turned on every single toolbar. docked it all around, shrunk my drawing space a ton to get every tool stuff i didn't even use. i turned the toolbar on just to fill the space. it's not bad. i mean, toolbars aren't bad. they're not slow. if i want to move this circle, i come up here and hit hit the move command. it's quicker than going up to tools and then coming down and clicking move for sure, but it's not as fast as just tapping the move key. right. so, my default is m. i hit m. i'm in move. getting used to using shortcut keys is a huge timesaver to the point that uh you know a lot of times as i'm modeling i will hit keys without looking without realizing i'm even doing it. uh and i just taught myself to use those shortcuts. and it is so much quicker. it is so much faster to use shortcut keys than to use even toolbarss or menus. plus if you're not relying on a bunch of toolbarss to be on your screen, you get all this real estate for modeling, right? you don't have to sacrifice the top quarter of your screen because you have all these toolbars taking space up. and the nice thing, i was showing in settings, you can apply a shortcut key to any command, including extensions. so, this is a super huge timesaver. don't spend time hunting and clicking on buttons. don't spend time in drop- down menus or extension menus. find the commands you use a lot and then put shortcuts on them and use them. they're going to be a huge timesaver. definitely do that. that's first thing, number one. all right. number two is right over here. entity info. i i knew what this was. i knew that this was a good thing to have. you know, i knew it existed. i didn't use it, though. i got to a point eventually where i had this open all the time. and with it always open, i could always see if i click on something. oh, here's a square footage. i want to toggle that off. oh, just go ahead and turn it off. um, i could change certain things. i grab the circle right here. oh, it's 2 foot three and some. well, it's supposed to be two foot even. so, i come in here, type two foot, and i could make those changes. super super helpful. i can even change colors in here. so, this entity info, once i figured this out, it made quality modeling, making sure i'm doing a good job modeling the thing i'm supposed to model, as well as making changes much simpler, right? so, i mean, i would spend a lot of time using the eraser and that kind of thing where i could just come in here and toggle things on and off or even lock stuff or just it was it's hard to to really express. it's because it seems so foundational at this point in my modeling journey to have entity info open and you can double check as you model what's in here. so make sure that's up. so use shortcut keys entity info. my third thing, this one's embarrassing you for real. so if i take this circle and i go grab pushpull, there's my shortcut key. and i pull this up. uh this is a circle. it's welded. i get this nice smooth thing that happens sometimes as we're modeling stuff breaks, right? and you end up with this where i'm pulling up not a smooth circle but a 24 segment shape and i get all these faceted pieces. now, when i started, i thought this was broken beyond repair. the two things i did not know about, one was i could come in and use a modifier key with soft with erase to turn on soft and smooth. this right here. on a mac, it's option. i click that and i can just come in and i can smooth that all out. i didn't know i could do that. the other thing i didn't know i could do, if i undo that, i didn't know i could grab this circle, right, these, and rightclick, weld edges. well, at the time when i started using it, weld edges was not native. it was an extension. uh, but i didn't know i could do that. and once that's done, now i can just pull that up and it works the same way. so i didn't know that's a that's a two for one. i didn't know about soften and smooth. i did not know about welding. but if you know those things, you can go. so i would literally if i had that happen, i would delete the geometry and recreate it and try push pulling again and hope that it wasn't broken. so that was a big one for me that i said, i feel a little silly about not knowing that. and i can't remember since for the last four or five versions, weld has been native. so you have to get an extension. but extensions, now that i mentioned that, this does bring me to my fourth thing that i didn't realize or didn't know about when i started using sketchup, or i guess i knew about them, but didn't take advantage of them. and that is, of course, extensions. so there's a button right in sketchup, has been for many, many years, where i can jump right to the extension warehouse and i can go find time-saving extensions. um, this is a double-edged sword, of course. don't get in here. don't don't just start downloading extensions. don't just grab everything that's up here. uh, there's a lot of extensions that are pretty heavy. they do some awesome amazing stuff, but it's not if it's not relative to your workflow, it's probably not worth downloading right this second. um, but if you ever find yourself doing something in modeling or running up against a limitation or repetitively modeling the same way and doing the same thing over and over again, there's a good chance that somebody else has had that issue, too, and has gone out and made an extension to save you from doing that thing. it can be hard to just wander into extension warehouse and not know what you're looking for. so, you can do things use the categories to say, "okay, well, i want to look at some uh some drawing tools." i'll click on that and just search the whole thing. and here's the drawing tools. that's going to give you a whole lot of stuff. i mean, it's still , you know, trying to drink the ocean one sip at a time. there's a lot there, but if you know a specific thing, so i want to i want a a bevel tool. i can put that in. and then i get a couple of those tools. this is great. if you if you're still having a hard time, not sure how to uh what the right term is to put in here or how to search for stuff, i would suggest checking out our forum, forums. go up and talk about the process you're doing and just say, is there any extensions that uh i should take a look at. we have talked about this before in the videos. i do think that people should for the most part get used to modeling using the native tools before they dump a bunch of extensions in. but there's definitely a point where having an extension is going to save you time and looking into and learning about them is definitely an important part as you start to get more and more competent and spend more and more time in sketchup. all right, so our top four so far, one was shortcut keys. two was using the entity info. three was the double weld and soften to get uh you know rounded shapes. four is using extensions. and five, five feels a little bit a little bit of a cheat because it's not exactly sketchup, but let me explain how this works. number five is layout. so from very early on when i use sketchup, i tried to get something out of it, right? so i would i it's great to go in and model something here, but sooner or later if i'm building something, um i'm showing somebody something, sooner or later i want to get something out of here. and i would do basically print screens from sketchup. i would go to an orthogonal top- down view of something i had drawn, put draw dimensions on, whatever, that sort of thing, and hit print screen, take that into photoshop or illustrator or inesign or something that to position it and print it out. i jump through so many hoops before realizing how easy i had it with layout. so, layout lets me pull in my model exactly as it is, set an exact scale on it. um, if you're not using layout already and you're doing any kind of exporting, if you're going to another program, if you're, i said, screenshotting your model, you're exporting your model and doing so, check out layout. layout can save you huge amounts of time. and i can set it up with templates to make it very quick and easy. if if i knew the capabilities of layout that i do now when it first came out, um i would have saved myself so much time. it's almost painful to think how many screenshots i ended up editing in photoshop and took into different programs where i could have just come in here and my needs were so simple. i could have knocked it out and laid out in a few seconds. so that is my fifth thing. i said, it's cheating a little bit. it's going outside. but i mean, i was doing it wrong cuz i was literally coming in here and going, "okay, this is ready to go out and doing a screenshot that and and exporting that out or sending that to the printer or something." it was terrible. it was a huge time-consuming process and it was never very good looking after i was done. so, there you go. five things that i admit i got wrong. so, i said, there's there's there's definitely another group of things where new users don't think about this inside of sketchup. i said, that's making a group, inferencing, uh learning to orbit, those things. absolutely. everybody jumps over those. and if you come from another 3d drawing or cad package, uh there's some a handful of things that you you've programmed your brain to think differently and you got to let go of to embrace sketchup for what it is. um, so maybe that's another video. let me know if you think that would be a good video. but this i wanted to . these were the five things that i personally 's things he got wrong when he tried to start lo using sketchup. so i that. hopefully that's helpful. uh, if you haven't already, please click down below and maybe too. uh, we create several videos each and every week. in fact, i think we put something out every day, including a live stream on fridays and you can be notified about all of them if you . most importantly though, leave us a down below. was there something on your list that you wish you just just one of these the headpaw moments uh where you're , "how did i not know that? how did it take me so long to figure that out?" let me know down in the comments. and if you have any ideas for other videos you think would be good, you said, i said, let me know if if you think that that list of things that new people always overlook is a good idea. let me know about that in the comments, too. we making these videos a lot. we them even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
