##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look using sketchup to draw vases or is it vases um well we'll do one of each we'll do a vase and then we'll do a vase and then that way you could tell the difference um this was actually a request from a viewer they asked if we could go through the steps of doing this which is really great because it is it's a it's a me technique where we take a profile one side of an item and we use me to you know circle that around or a shape around uh to create a vase or boss one of the two um so it's not a difficult process but there are a few steps to it and let's uh we're going to take a look at how that works right now all right so i got a couple uh examples i was just kind of playing around with some shapes this a one with a lot of curves this one with some straight sides on it uh see some straight sides down here too so uh let's just walk through the steps real quick so first thing you're going to do is we're going to draw a circle so i'm just going to grab circles and i'm going to click and just pull something out that what i generally do then is i want to draw the profile so i'll come over this uh just draw a rectangle actually doesn't have to be a rectangle but a shape that's going to you know a flat surface to draw on is basically what i'm looking for here so what i will generally do then is kind of come in here and using straight lines just drawing on the surface i will kind of rough in what i think the shape's going to look so maybe something this will curve out and then it'll curve back in and then go up and then maybe it'll come back out again i don't know something that maybe and then what i generally do then is that's when i grab my arc and i start filling in my arcs and now obviously uh probably goes without saying but i'm going to say it anyhow the amount of uh segments you put on your arc the more arc you know the more segments you put on the smoother your arcs are going to look but all right so something that and then what i'll do is i will erase my extra lines i'll be honest with you half the time i do this i'm i'm pleasantly surprised or sometimes disappointed with the way it all turns out so uh yeah it really depends uh what i'm going to do then is i if i if i was to use me to just the shape around the circle i'd have a solid piece but i want to i do want this open so what i'm going to do is i'm going to double click and then i'm going to hold down the modifier keys to get to my minus so i'm on mac so it's shift plus option and i'm going to deselect most of these edges so all i want is the edges out here then i'm going to use offset to pull that line in about that much and maybe we'll make the bottom solid so i'll draw one more arc something something that maybe there down there we go all right now get rid of this i got to round off this i i don't this i want to do this i'm going to draw a circle right here in the middle pull it across and then just get rid of this that gives a nice round edge on the top all right so now what i'll do is i'll grab this circle down here and i will say tools me because i have not put this up on my toolbar yet which i should cuz ied use it a lot and i'll just click on the shape and there we go we got a vase this ended up more of a goblet i went a little big on the top but you get the you get the picture of of how it looks um yeah so that looks looks pretty good it's not ideal though there's some stuff i don't love about it for one thing if i look underneath all of these have no bottom so first thing i have to do to clean this up would be drop another uh line right there close that up the other thing that happened is i got this segment right here another segment right here right here all these all these segments not a big deal because i can just select it this and then i can grab my soften and smooth dialogue box which is for some reason over on my other screen but here it is and then i can turn on soften c planer and then get rid of those extra edges so that looks better um but yeah let's let's do better let's let's uh let's do that in one instead of any cleanup steps so here's what i'm going to do uh i'm i'm going to come over here and uh start with my rectangle let's do a rectangle first so i'm just going to draw my shape this is the that shape that i drew my profile on so roughly the same size and then i'm going to do this a little bit different because then i'm going to grab my circle and rather than putting the circle right here where it was before i'm going to drop down slightly and put it down below so you can see it's down below by putting it down below oh i should also mention the circle size doesn't matter i think i happened to match the this footprint to the the circle it doesn't matter any circle works by having it disconnected here it's going to eliminate this need to fill in the bottom all right so let's go ahead and i'm just going to go through very similar steps to what i did last time so i'm just going to draw up over i apparently this is how i think vases work they have a step that it's going to come over here then i'm going to have it come out you do a big sweep this and that's going to kind of come in this come up and then i only want to bring it out part way not quite as far so same thing i'm going to do here i'm just a little bit differently though let's let's let's do this let's put a full circle here and a full circle here and a full circle here and then when we clean that up we'll get a shape that looks that kind of nice something a little different and then i grab my arc and we'll bring this up and around this um i think i'm going to not quite go with a full half circle something that oh yeah good all right then go this way and then bring this up here and then same thing i'm just going to clean up this outside edge grab that all right and oh i a little bump right here i don't really that so here's i'm just going to draw a segment that and just clean that up that looks better all right so same thing i did before i'm going to double click and then i'm going to deselect anything that's not the southside edge before i offset i'm going to right click and i'm going to say weld edges by welding the edges that makes this a single curve so i don't have to worry about doing stuff cleaning up the the pieces after the me so then i can just say offset and i can put that in here oh we got some cr oh there's i forgot where i was snapping from got some weird stuff going on down down at the bottom because the way i did this uh double circle thing here but that's okay uh because i will again i'll come right here take that straight across that get rid that and then same as did last time quick half circle right here all right oops oops is here what wait not sure there we go all right i'm going to do this one more time i'm going to triple click grab all those edges and then i'm just going to do another uh weld edges and then watch this so remember last thing we had we had we had bands in here all the way around circles around we had no bottom so this time when i select the circle down below tools me click the shape not only do we get a a much healthier looking vase this is a this is a vase this is actually a goblet these are vases over here there's a vase look at that thing that's sturdy you could park a truck on there um but see there's no broken pieces the bottom is is good we can delete that um actually i'm going to back up a couple steps because i want to do something here just as one more option we'll do that again so grab the circle tools tools oh come on tools me click here awesome get rid that so uh i do one more thing i want to show this is this is the bonus uh rather than doing a circle let's do this with a different shape let's go to polygon let's put a six-sided polygon right down below here that grab this shape tools me click the same exact shape and look what we get in that case that's a that's a vase with a long a if ever i've seen one that's just that's pure fanciness and maybe that's what differentiates a vase from a bos these are vases these are vases that's that's the big difference um yeah so there we go so when you are doing a me to create a vas shape and this is we were using vases but this could be a wine glass this could be a coke bottle this could be um i don't know a specific building depending on what you're doing anytime you do this sort of me thing the thing to do is put your path down below so it doesn't connect that way it'll close your faces up that's important and then weld your profile beforehand that's going to give you nice easy clean edges we got in these models right here so there we go not only do you now know how to do that in sketchup but now you know the difference between of bas and of oas and that was that's a little bonus education right there i i threw that in for free if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please leave us a down below did you pick up anything new out of that you have a different thing you to do when you create these kinds of shapes do you have input on base versus vase let us know down below we making these videos a lot we give even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
