##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here and today i want to with you some of my tips for taking sketchup's default style capabilities and pushing them to their limits so what do i mean pushing style capabilities to the limits i think most of us that are familiar with sketchup have already explored the styles menu we know that we have control over edges whether that's thickness or even color and we know that we have control over some overrides whether that's monochromatic or color by tag as far as the face style but there's a few things that actually get interesting when you combine those things so that's what i want to do i want to do a little bit of exploration a little bit of tinkering and uh i think the results are going to be fun so stay with me let's do this speaking of style i kind of wanted to start with a stylized model and not get hung up too much on realism for this uh for this lesson or this demo so i've got my little fox here that i modeled kind of created a little forest scene that i'm in the process of building out this is just kind of a starting point where i was playing around and um you can see it's low poly and that's perfect because what we want to do stylistically is not focus so much on adding materials in this case um we just kind of want to focus on line and color and shadow and light so with that said i'm going to go ahead and expand both my shadow and my styles pallets and kind of push them off to the side here make them bigger if i need to and i want to start by kind of pointing out a something really quick so by default if you are familiar with how shadows work you can adjust both the lightness and the darkness and what happens is is that when you're looking at something orange this is a single color in my model it's orange but you can see that the orange displays differently depending on how much light or shadow light or dark i want to play with so for this demo i actually want to push my darkness up toight 90 and i want to push my lightness down to zero and what that gives me is it gives me that true color so you can see that's actually the true color that i've got that i've applied so i'm actually not working with light in this case i want to work with just color and just line work and we're going to come back to shadows here at the end so don't i've got a surprise on that one so even with the shadows turned on you can see my shadows are on you see can they don't show up they don't show up because i've slid my lightness slider all the way down so they're on but they don't show up anyway so now let's kind of take a look at one of the first options that we have with styles um that's i'm going to kind of i'm going to ignore shadows for right now but we'll come back to this so under styles um i have the default style that most of it it's mostly default and what i mean is is that um if you look over here if you start at the far left which is edges most of the default style is set this edges are showing profiles are showing and set set to a thickness of two and your color is all the same and it's set to as dark basically solid black as black as black goes so that's pretty much how whenever you open a new sketchup model even if the background might be a little bit different color most of the time that's the setting that we all get so most people don't change that style which means that when they post their model or they it theirs is going to look a lot other people's because that's the default style so what i want to do is do a couple of things let's explore what happens when we start to customize starting with just the edges i'm going to go ahead and for this i'm going to turn edges off completely so what happens when i turn edges off i get just the profiles so a profile is kind of flank the outer line of the group so if i turn my edges on you can see that i've got some 2d trees here if i turn my hidden geometry on some of these are 2d face mees and some of these are sort of 3d i'm playing around stylistically with the geometry um but so if i turn those hidden lines off and i turn edges off you can see that all those interior edges that make up the polygons are gone so even with hidden geometry on those don't show up i get just that sort of outer profile which is kind of cool stylistically um and i'll give you an example why two that helps as you can see the rings on this tree this was actually done if i switch to monochromatic mode you can see that those edges actually show um and i may want to just use that alternating material between light and dark of the wood grain create that wood grain so by turning those edges off and leaving my color on you can see that i get a nice kind of stylistic color there so that's one reason kind of why you might want to um just turn the edges off completely just depending on what it is the level of detail that you want to show now for me here though i want to look at a couple things number one is the profiles i can push this up if i'm going with a cartoonish style i can push the profiles up higher which might actually help me now if you get too much it starts starts to get a little blocky maybe it starts to get a little messy so i might kind of try three that looks okay little heavy you know the default two isn't too bad if i go to one two if you go to one if you've ever noticed this that's basically the same as if you didn't have the profiles on and you had your edges turned on so that's that profile uh set to one you'll notice when i turn profiles on and off it shows up on round objects but on these objects it's no thicker than it normally is because our default edges are set to a thickness of one so if you do that sort of outer edge if i turn my edges off completely and i just want a nice thin profile i could leave that set to the lowest setting which is one same as my edges or you know if i'm okay with just something a little more cartoonish i could push this up personally the thicker the edges are the darker the more that that sort of black uh i don't want to say bugs me but it starts to read as heavy so one cool trick here is that under edge collar you can c click color here and that highlights and it means that the colors are active so this is black i want to kind of show you what happens when we go black little bit lighter and i'm just going to kind of step through i'm going through my crayons here i know if you're on windows or pc you don't have crayons but you can do this again with the color wheel if you just wanted to start with slide it from black and then just kind of pull that edge style i'm going to go all the way until we get to white and see what that looks maybe that's too thick so i'll set it back to one and that's an interesting look you can see the difference between white and black is that white lightens the model and black kind of darkens it or makes it more heavy so black white or gray light gray black now personally for me i to kind of step it down just a little bit two or three shades so it's somewhere in that kind of charcoal gray color what's nice about that is you get the definition of having those darker edges but you don't get the um you don't get the really heaviness that you would see with black while we're on edges i'm going to stop with the color here because instead of changing it to a single color that's what happens when the color of the edges is set to all the same if i change it to bu material what it's going to do it's going to pick up the underlying material that's underneath it i'm going to bump this up just a little bit to something two or even three for this so you can see this just a little bit better you can see that those edges are there if you look closely those edges are there but it's pulling the color from the color of the object so if i change the color of the object i can change uh the color of that edge so the bu material is kind of nice because you can see that there's just a little bit of definition but it's really subtle and i kind of that now one way to do that though is you kind of want to think about you may need to think about how this is grouped for example if i have this whole fox group here and i apply a color to it and i'm just bear with me here um nothing's going to happen because i've got subgroups so if you depending on where you want to apply color you can either pick up the color from the face or you can pick up a color from the group that's a little bit confusing i confuse myself when i say that you can actually have two different colors on a single object but what i mean is and let's maybe use the rock that's a better example because it's not made up of multiple pieces but i've got this rock here and if i select this you can see that i've got a color applied to the outside of the face but i've also got a color applied to the face as well so both the face has a color and the object has a color so if i change in under in my entity in info box if i change the color something again i'll try that pink see if that works you can see that i have now a different color from the color of the rock and that's because i'm using it by material so if i set it to all the same it's going to be all the same if i set it to by material then it's going to ask me well which material if there's no material applied to the outside if i set this back to say the default color then it's going to grab it's going to just use the default color which is the same which is this color which is the color of my um default line work so by applying a color to the outside if you wanted to say go lighter you could go lighter and you can have a just this object have a different color edge than the other objects in your model in this case going lighter might be kind of weird going pink might be kind of weird maybe going let's try this again maybe going just one shade darker if you see if you look really close it's one shade or maybe even two shades darker than the actual color the face color of the rock and again this depends on your lighting because if you have your lighting uh then the face color is going going to um either show or not show so right now it's why i turned the light off because i wanted to deal with just the pure color and not deal with um with sort of how the color appears with the way the light is hitting it so i'm going to wrap up here by doing one more thing i want to close out by kind of doing a an interesting trick which is colored shadows now i know that's something that some people have been asking for for a while i know that's something that maybe um is in the works but for now there is kind of a little bit of a workaround you can see that my shs are still there but they're not showing but if i change the color on the styles menu if i come over here to the background color i can set a background color that is different right now it's set to white which is why you're not seeing anything but i can set a background color let's say blue and then make sure that the shadows are showing which means on ground so right there i kind of had them off by default which maybe i shouldn't have but i should be on by default which is on ground so when i turn my shadows back on what's happening is that my shadows you can see if i zoom out my background color is sort of blue almost water but my i have this plane this is my ground plane and it sits it's sort of sits above the background or just underneath it maybe just slightly underneath it so when i zoom in i have essentially even though my lightness sliders turned all the way down i have this ability now to show colored shadows and what's cool about that is that i can just kind of play around with the hue so the lighter the color is the more it might feel it's picking it's letting that brown the sort of light brown of my ground plane come through um and then of course the darker it is the more it's going to feel it's standing out from the background so finding that sort of right balance as if it's almost a natural color that you might see um if you were out in the landscape is kind of cool now there's no shadows actually on the tree or the objects itself these are just shadows that are on the ground and that's why i say it's a bit of a trick and it may or may not work for what you're trying to do and of course if you zoom out your background is going to be colored which is why i have this ground plane so if i zoom in i get sort of an interesting stylistic um choice so those are my style choices and i think there's actually quite a bit more you can do i'm not going to go into it but if you wanted to play around with face style for example uh um and you wanted to play around with now face style and background color if i turn that background color to white you have just really really a lot of control with how objects are expressed and of course i didn't even really go into color by tag mode when we go into color by tag mode uh there's quite a bit let's see color by tag is on there we go so really cool stylistic things that we can do uh just depending on what you're um what you're after what you're going what you're going for each of these settings i think give you a lot of control on their own so changing the color of the edges changing the uh lightness of the faces the color of the faces based on the shadow settings each of those can be done individually to give you your own personal style but what's really cool that i'm trying to show here is that when you start combining methods now all of a sudden i'm playing with background ed color edge thickness lightness i'm combining these things and i'm getting something not only unique to me but i think unique to a lot of people who use sketchup who haven't seen sketchup sort of expressed visually this way so i'm going to stop there i'm going to encourage you to take over and start playing around and let me know how some of these tips or how some of these styles can be used in your work so as always post it in the comments below give us that thumbs up give us that so you can be notified of all the content that's coming out every single week and i'm going to leave you there i'm going to say thanks and see you next time
