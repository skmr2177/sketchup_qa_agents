##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we are going to model a fos i'm going to see how quickly you can do this not not rush through it but just see how quick we can go through the steps the big part of something this is breaking the thing down into modelable chunks so i want to do a quick breakdown of this this particular image tell you how i would go about modeling it and then try to put it together fairly quickly let's hop in all right so what i tend to do when i start looking at something this is i break it down into modelable chunks so when i look at this i wouldn't go in and try to model this all as one piece i would try to break it down into smaller pieces so in this case uh this base right here would be one piece uh this section coming up will be a second intersected by a thir on the end of that we have a fourth piece the neck that goes up and curves over would be a fifth piece and then the head would be the sixth piece so let's let's just model that i'm i'm going to do this fairly this is not a tocale image anything that so i'm just going to model beside this um i'm not going to take strict measurements off or anything that but um let's get that base in there real quick so the base looks it's a rectangle about that big and then it's rounded over at the end so i'm just going to put a circle and a circle and then just come through with an eraser i'm going to pull that up a little bit actually undo i'm going to select those edges and i'm going to weld them then i'm going to pull it up slightly offset bring it in a little bit and then i will push that up again and i'm going to call that my base and put it in its own group and then what we're going to do is we're going to create this next piece on top of it i want that piece to set right in the middle here so i'm going to grab a circle and go to the middle point start pulling down uh i can line that up with the other edge over here so bring that across so it hits that middle and then there we go and that circle's going to go all the way out that um for the profile what i generally do is something this i draw a rectangle coming up aligning with the middle of that that circle and then i will draw my rect my my shap tape on top of this so it looks i got two bump bump then it goes up straight bump and then i have a taper so i'm going to do something this i'm going to come in here a little bit and this is going to be the body of that and we'll come right here we'll do a quick circle this and then all i need is this piece so i'll just take that piece drag it straight down modifier key to put that up once right there and then we're going to take that again and we're we're going to bring that up to about there at which point this will kind of angle up that gives me that shape that um and i'm i'm going kind of quick but i can come through here and i can round this corner off a little bit that's probably more how that's going to look um looks good all right i'm going to take my circle i'm going to use me and there we go triple click that make it a new group uh oops here i don't need that i don't need the circle underneath there anymore all right so there's that base piece this piece coming out what i want to do is i want to make that actually here let's let's let me undo that let me go grab that circle right there copy it now i can delete it i'll come out here and paste that i actually was saying i want a circle just slightly smaller than this so i'm going to take this and i'm going to inset it just just offset just push it off just a little bit that and then i will take that we'll rotate that 90¬∞ and we'll grab it by the middle we'll take the middle of that and we'll line it up with the middle of this there we go and then uh we'll just drop it down a bit i'm realizing right now as i'm doing this it i i made this a little bit shorter than i wanted that's okay cu it's easy to come in here grab this and we'll just stretch that up a little bit that gives a little more space for this which makes a little more sense all right i'm going do the same same exact thing i did before i will take this out draw it straight up again i'm just getting a rectangle a surface just to draw my profile on and i'm just want to draw something along these lines so what this looks what we got happening is this comes out this to i don't know about there and then maybe we go uh it's kind of hard shiny stuff especially can be kind of difficult to see exactly how this works but looks kind of got these uh stepping doy shapes technical term right there apologize if that's over your head uh but we're going to do something this we're going to start uh this one's going to come out a little a little bit further it's going to come this come down this one's going to come out to about here step down and then this one's going to be about here it went off axis that's why that that line got weird well that's there's your problem all right i was not paying attention to my uh my number or my colors as i was going across and i wandered off axis there all right at the end the very end i do want to have this a little stem sticking out the handle will will tie into that so that's about what we want there and then i just have to put some curves on here so i'm just going to i'm going to use an arc and i'm going to just kind of do something this actually that one will go kind of further down almost almost to here and then what i didn't do is i didn't take this one back so we'll do that here that does that one step up too a little bit so actually what happens is this kind of returns a little bit and then goes this something that all along those lines cool and i'll take this again and then we will me with this we got kind of our there's our our shape and i can fine-tune a little bit here too because i can grab this geometry and i can say all right let's let's stretch that let's scale that out a little bit i to do this cuz i i it's kind of sculpting you know so if i want to grab maybe just this part and scale that and maybe drag that out a little bit more i can play with those those shapes and then what i want to do down here i'm going to close that and then just drag that in that perfect i'm going to triple click make that into a new group um and then i'm going to real quick uh we're going to throw together this piece right here i could probably do this actually on here watch this i could just i'm going drag line straight down and then i'm going to kind of draw my profile here that and then i'm going to draw a full circle right here uh when i'm drawing stuff this i will draw it a little bit ways because then i can always drag it and drag it back down where i want it that all right that's going to then go up out up little bit in up back out up back in and then i'm going the same thing i'm going to come up here this handle goes out this this handle goes out this and then i can use arcs to kind of just close a lot of that up so come back to here and then can also use arcs my round my roundness out there all right so something along those lines then that whole thing then would just be traced around a circle the circle i just drag right down here grab that just say me click there and then i'll triple click make that a group and then and i will grab it right by that piece that will go right into the middle of this circle right here turns transparent so it's real easy to line that up where it goes and then slide it back in all right last two pieces this one's pretty simple um i'm going to turn on uh my i'm going to turn go to view show my hidden geometry temporarily that's going to make it easier to find the center right here if i draw a line from here to here the middle of that edge is then the center so i can just say i'm going to draw an edge that going to go straight up straight out and then straight down and then i will create an arc here here there we go get rid of that get rid of that and then uh i'm gna triple click actually i'll do a group select because i don't want that i don't want this edge down here but i'll grab those right click and say weld edges get rid of these edges down here come here and draw a circle exactly that biggish going grab that one more not one more another me it's going to bring that tube up and around um see our our whole thing is a little chunky a little little wide but uh that's okay i can turn off my hidden edges too i don't need those uh hidden geometry anymore uh and then the last piece i'm going to have here is going to be uh this piece here and i'm going to do the same thing this doesn't quite hit perfectly flat so i'm going to i'm going to have to exaggerate a little bit but i'm going to have a piece that comes out this that comes in a little bit and then up here abouts we'll have a piece that comes this and then that and that's that's all that's all there is to it um i'm not going to get all the detail i want into uh the the head i'm not going to i'm not going to uh um just because of the time we're working with here but i'll i'll go ahead and just do something this will have a you know the geometry of the head will be there but i'm not going to put the little holes and such in there just cuz i'm making a quick quick version here so i'm going to drop a circle i'm going to hit my up arrow to make it flat pull it out again same thing select uh a me hit that here grab that triple click make that into a new group and grab it right by the center so i come across here this is not a circle because it's a me it's an extruded shape but i can always reference the two edges that and that'll get me the very middle right we turn upside down then same thing's going to happen here i don't have that middle ledge i'm go to one corner another corner pull that across go and drop it there we go oops too much deleting get rid of that edge we don't need that edge all right but there we go and then i can get rid of these circles over here i can triple click i can grab all of these pieces make that into oops what piece didn't i oh this was not a separate group make that into its own group now i could grab all of these make that into a new group itself and there we go there is there is our our quick faucet uh based on on just an image all right so we weren't this is this is by no means uh working off of machining drawings where i'm within a millimeter accuracy i don't i don't know my accuracy was at all but what i got was a faucet in what about a little over 10 minutes uh right off of a photo and that could very well go into my model and represent uh that faucet uh that the customer wants specifically and i can't find on 3d warehouse something that so not intended to be fabrication ready i wouldn't want to use this to create drawings and send to a machine shop anything that but uh it's enough in a quick amount of time to get that geometry where it's going to i mean no arguing that's a faucet right i mean that's that's what that thing is uh and it looks the one in there if i put a little gold on there uh hopefully that uh that helps and uh you learn some new tricks there if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please do leave us a down below are there models this that you can think of that you're not quite sure how to break down and how to model uh let us know that in the comments or if you have another idea that you think would make a good video something we don't do regularly let us know that too we making these videos a lot we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
