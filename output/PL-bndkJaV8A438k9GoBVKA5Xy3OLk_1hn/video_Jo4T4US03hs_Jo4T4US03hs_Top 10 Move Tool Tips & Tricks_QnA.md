##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i have for you 10 my top 10 tips and tricks for the move command i know that seems a lot right move seems pretty simple you click move you click this thing and you click where you want to go yeah it is it is that simple but there's a lot more that it can do and we're talk about all those things well at least 10 of those things right now all right first things first uh move command is up here under tools you click here to go to move um it's also on the toolbar uh i have it on the default toolbar it's part of large tool set um but i'm going to tell you right now the way to do that to get into to move is to use a shortcut key the default shortcut key is the m key it's great it's right above the space bar it's easy to hit uh it you know it's kind of stands out in the crowd it's got two pokey it's pointing up that's kind of nice so yeah m's an easy one to get to that is the shortcut key of course if you want to change the shortcut key you can go to preferences short cuts and assign a different key to it but as m is probably one of the more used modification tools i would recommend using a shortcut key that you are you know you're going to want to smack a lot this this is a a a key that you're going to want to use a bunch um all right so here is something that we can do with move so if you're in move and nothing is selected when you move over something it will automatically highlight so if i move over this group right here it highlights and then i can click to start my move if i hit escape everything's unh highlighted and i go to the next thing i want to move and move it um this works different from pre-select we'll talk about pre-selecting items in a moment but without anything selected move will automatically select something based on where you click when you click so it's a little bit different from other commands because uh there you can use it totally with nothing selected and which will let you just come in here grab something move it and then you're back out of the command again now you're ready to select something new select move it click to place it and you're back out and ready to select something new so it's kind of nice if you have a bunch of things to move or you have things you want to move to multiple locations you can without selecting anything just move over the thing one item at a time the other thing that you can do when you have nothing selected is you can not just move things surfaces edges but you can actually move points so i can actually move over this point right here click on it and now i'm moving that point around away from the rest of the model this can only be done if you go into move with nothing selected so to do that of course if i come in here uh if you tap the the escape key once you'll make sure nothing is highlighted if you're burrowed down deep into multiple components or groups or something that you might have to tap escape multiple times but escape will deselect everything and then you can pick any point you just hover over the point and when it's highlighted click and release and now you're moving when you find the spot you want it to go click and release and it will place it there i'm going to undo that cuz i didn't that speaking of moving or distorting geometry so when i grab that point you can see all the other all the other edges connected to that point moved along with my mouse i i made a mess of this uh this block that i got right here i can do the same thing with edges so normally if i move over an edge and i click i start dragging it i'm going to be constrained usually on one of the axes uh which is going to limit how i can move so that i don't overly distort the geometry so right now i did i did not hit an arrow key to constrain my movements i'm just just moving my my cursor in a circle you see it's only moving back and forth that is because something called autofold we have it down here in the toolbar see i'm on mac so it says the modifier key for me is command equals toggle autofold autofold is turned off right now so it's not going to let me fold up or change the geometry if i do tap that modifier key now i can move in any direction and distort this geometry however i want you can see as i move it over this way it does cause that front front face to break so i have two faces there instead of one i come back here slide this way so you can see that's what autof full does if autof folds turn on i can move this anywhere i want if autof fold is is not turned on then i am limited to movements that don't break the connected faces great tip to have if you know that it's going to happen okay um i'm going to go ahead and i guess some loose geometry i'm going to make this a group and i'll just make this a group maybe we'll explode them later but uh i mentioned coming into move which is the m key hop in there real quick and easy lets me hover over anything and move it but there are some cases where you want to move more than one thing or uh maybe you want to pick a thing first and then hit the move key um that's going to let you pick your from and to point uh the other thing i can do if i pre-select is i can select multiple things so i select all these bricks and then hit move and now i am moving all three of them in one go that can only be done if you select before you hit the move key again if i hit move key if i hit move before anything selected now i'm in the click to select mode i can only pick one but that is an option too all right the other thing i can do is when i do move so i'm going to just pick this one block and i'm going to go into move when i go to move i can hover over the corners of this container so this this what i'm showing right now is only relative to groups or components because they're the only things that have these containers um and if i go onto a corner right here i could actually grab it and move it from there to align that with another piece of geometry or something that if i want these two to butt up against each other i could grab that and move it right here um if i want want to change i can actually hit there's a if i watch the bottom right here if i hover over my selected group i have an option lists a modifier key and says click this to cycle through grip types so if i hit that modifier key i will change so that went from showing me the corner points to now showing me the midpoints of all the edges see that if i hit it again it'll show me the middle points of all the sides hit it again one more time and now i get there we go the middle point of the entire volume so just tapping that modifier key each time is going to give me a different set of points that i can move from so a nice option i said you do have to actually have what you have to have highlighted is a thing that is in a container so it does have to be in a group or uh a component for this to work but then you can actually choose where you want to move it from and get a point at each of those spots speaking of moving i don't have to grab a any geometry connected to the thing i'm moving actually so if i select this this brick right here i go into move and i click on this point as my from point and this point as my two point it will move that piece of geometry relative to those two points a lot of people i'm going to undo think that when when you go to move you do have to grab a point that is on here that's not necessarily true and there's some cases based on geometry if you have real complicated geometry working in a in a big builtup model you might not really be able to easily select the point you want to move but you can always use reference geometry to move things the point you move from or the point you move to doesn't have to be in any way connected to the selected geometry speaking of moving uh this tip should go without saying but doesn't always uh arrow keys to lock so if i want to move along this red axis but i'm having a hard time keeping my cursor directly on that dotted red line i can always hit the right arrow and that's going to lock the red axis in and now i can do things if i want this to line up with this piece i can click right here and then that will have moved along the red axis parallel to where it was originally arrow keys are huge don't forget them sometimes it is easy to forget that you do that get irritated i can't snap to the point i want to i can't move where i want to you forget the basics using your arrow keys all right uh the other one this is simple but uh move is also copy so if again if you look down at the bottom we have this thing right here there's a modifier key for copy stamp and i'm if i tap that key whatever that modifier key is if i tap it once i'll get a little plus sign next to my move cursor and then i can grab geometry and then when i click it will put a new copy in that location the other thing i can do is i can tap that button twice if i tap it twice then i go into stamp mode and stamp mode says okay pick my from command my from location and every time i click again i'm going to create new geometry and the cool thing is something to think about here i can combine some of this stuff too because i can come in here i go to move put turn on my stamp and and rather than clicking where i want to start from i could use something my my relative copy again or my relative move i click this point and say between this point this point place one there place one here place one here i don't actually have to connect connect to any geometry to move with copy or stamp just i don't have to when i'm moving that was 10 i was counting that was 10 things and i know some of those okay you probably maybe already knew about copy uh but uh maybe you use the arrow keys all the time every time you move no question about it but uh i would love to hear if there's anything in there that slipped your mind you forgot about or you didn't even know about it would be cool to hear that if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you be notified of all of them if you most importantly though do leave us a down below i was saying if there's something specific in this video you want to call out or if i miss something is there an 11th thing about the move command that i totally didn't catch tell me about that down in the comments as well or if you have an idea if there's another command inside of sketchup that you're i need to go deep with this tell me everything that just to know about this let me know maybe we'll try to whip together a tips and tricks video for that command or if you have something totally different something totally outside the box that you think would make a good video for us let us know that too write down those comments we read them cuz we making videos but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
