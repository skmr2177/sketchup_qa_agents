##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this time around let's combine 2d components with 3d components or even more versatile components so the idea is one that it's been around for a while of combining i could say 2d components and 3d components and then you put them into a nested component and turn different parts of it on and off via tags still i want to show how we can build that out and hopefully show a few tips if you are trying to create your own this is one of those things that can be used in a lot of different applications so let's have a look if you haven't seen these here's the basic idea so if i were to copy this i'm going to toggle stamp mode on and stamp this let's say a few times around this hillside and we could take any of these and scale or rotate them but if we wanted to look at this from a perspective view embedded in this component is a simplified version of that tree as well as a far more detailed version so depending on what you're doing and what stage your project is at for your final rendering you can turn on the detail tree but for a lot of cases your your performance will be greatly improved you know with something this and then of course you can also utilize a plan view so let's look at how we can create something this okay remove a few of these and turn this off now the first thing you'll want to do is create something this where you have added the tags that you need and you might get away with just two or you might add more tags than we have here we have three so create the tags that you're going to use and create a standard that you can use across similar objects that way you can turn them all off and all on when you bring them on bring them in let's create a version for this tree here now to give credit uh this uh is a tree as was the other one i found on the warehouse from this author so thank you and it's a lovely tree uh works very well but if we were to copy a bunch of these around turn shadows on it would definitely slow things down so i'm going to go to a front view turn perspective off and let's create a simplified version and i will start with a simple rectangle that is basically larger than the tree and move it in front of the tree depending on your preferences if you wanted a very detailed uh and accurate representation of this tree or something it have a look at a plug-in called fredo portrait it will take a 3d object and create a 2d outline of it and then even cast the image back onto it so it's pretty remarkable but we're just going to use a simple say simplified version so let me toggle x remote on and i'm going to use freehand to trace this now if we were to just start tracing let's say we trace this out this would be a problem because it's referencing back there all of the geometry of the tree however when i use the freehand tool i can tap the arrow keys to lock and access and for me that will be green so if i tap the left arrow key now when i draw because i started on the surface it's staying in the green plane and it's going to stay on that surface so that's we're going to use that to our advantage so here i am i'm going to draw on this surface i want to be careful i don't start drawing back here on the tree but i'm going to start on the surface and let me zoom about that far tap the left arrow key and start tracing this now if you want of course you can take your time and create a far more uh detailed version or simple version whatever is going to work for you we're just going to create something this another thing to know the freehand tool the new versions of the prehent tool you can change the segment count immediately after you've drawn a freehand curve i'm not going to do that in full transparency the build i'm using seems to have a little bug where sometimes that works and sometimes it deletes your line i suspect that won't be around for long but just so you know that's something that is an option that you can change the segment count i'm going to tap the left arrow key again and add just a little more detail to and even though i tapped i think it didn't work so let me undo that make sure there we go i'm not too worried about the segment count since we're creating a 2d version anyway okay and tapping the left arrow key but it's not always staying so i want to make sure that i'm getting that in any case that's the idea now if we look at this i can take this simplified version and i will just copy it or copy it over to the side but i've copied it on my keyboard and paste in place there we go now i'm going to make this component so i'm going to triple click on that surface we just drew and make it a component i'm going to make this a base me component so i'm going to click always face the camera and name it something useful again whether you have a naming convention that correlates to your tags or not we'll just do something that and i'm going to set the component axis at the base foreign let's create that and move it into position basically lined up the base of our full tree there and i'm going to move that to our tag which turns it off now i'm going to move this to our 3d tag eventually but for now i'll leave it alone while i create a quick plan view and to start i'll just draw a circle um we could just use a circle when i was going through uh architecture school this was a simplified way to draw a tree and plant something this there's a lot of different symbols out there for drawing it and um our other version we could spend time and create detail or not we could use the freehand tool we could come in and just be sure we are drawing you just create a little bit more of an edge down here if we wanted to oops so i will select this and make this a component as well now i would want to set that up initially by changing the axis but i didn't just to show that we can still do it after the fact if i turn the hillside on it's a useful thing at least in this case because landscape often you're dealing with things that are not flat if we move this around up here we we could have a situation where half of our our symbol is buried so i'm going to raise it up you know just a foot or two some distance and if i wanted i can also draw a line down so that we have a base to place this at or even a line up to represent how tall the tree is up to you and then i'm going to right click replace the axis place it at that base yep let's change the axis and we'll move this in place over here and move it to our 2d plan and then finally we'll move this to our detailed so we'll turn these back on select all of the pieces and make that to do something more do create a better name than green tree but whatever your your naming convention will be and i'm going to again set that component axis somewhere at the uh the base here so that when we bring it in we're placing it where it's going to sit again if you're doing furniture or a doorway there's a lot of different ways you might use 2d and 3d components so you might change that up a bit but there we go let's take our two trees here and foreign so you can create your own library of objects um something that would be useful for the type of work that you do the turn perspective back on and now we've got our simplified version it's nice and snappy and our more detailed version and again use this in different ways because you know you can use this for more than landscaping but depending on how you use it if you use it for furniture or vegetation just have a similar naming convention and then you can control all of these at once hopefully that was uh useful to you if you haven't seen that before then give it a try and if you have hopefully you have some different ideas of how you might approach it as always we want the conversations to continue so please let us know what other tips or tricks or questions you have or suggestions you have on this or other techniques we'd love to hear your thoughts and please do and click that button if you so thanks y'all see you next time foreign
