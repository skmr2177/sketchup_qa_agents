##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this is part two of using the scale tool as a modeling technique yes that's right so we do have another video released just prior to this one where we go into using the scale tool to manipulate geometry pull geometry out scale it up and down and in that one we stayed very symmetrical and cylindrical but in this one we're going to break away from that and do some different shapes and this plain example will be a good option to practice on so let's have a look this should be pretty interesting we have for example this bent wing and some things to try but let's start back here with the tail because this will a good way to introduce the simple idea before we're simply pulling out a shape then selecting that new shape and using the scale tool to scale either side or from the center then we pull this out some more but rather than scaling from the center all the time which we were doing previously this time we may be scaling from one side or the other we might be scaling from the center but it's a little more freeform modeling as we move along now if you get to a curve this you might add more steps in here than what i'm going to do because we're just going to keep kind of showing this idea but you can see here and and get the general idea of how this works maybe one more scale it from the center and of course we could come back in and select any of these and tweak tweak them as needed even select uh you know several and say let's bring these all downs make that thinner but even though this is you know fairly low geometry if we were to smooth these edges it still looks pretty good so you again you can add more steps um and make this look even smoother along this curve but that's the basic idea is just using that scale tool pulling out sometimes using move let's try that again this time we'll see uh about building out this wing a little bit i'm going to select this profile make a component and i'm going to do that so that i can make a copy of it and start manipulating it down here where i can see this now depending on how you set up your reference photos you may not need to do this because you might set these up a line better but this will be fine i'm going to align that a little better and maybe move it down just so it's close we just want to get the idea here so let's say we bring this down and we scale this a little bit and you may or may not if you're actually punching through your reference i am need to turn x-ray mode on somewhat frequently but so we've scaled that in a little bit made our wing a little thinner now we pull that out a little more i'm going to turn this i'm going to try and turn this with uh not too much detail just in the interest of time but you might make a few more transitions but let's rotate this and see if we can move it up a little bit back okay i'm going to do that once more and now here you can see it's it's doing something a little weird it doesn't have if we look at hidden geometry it doesn't necessarily have the geometry to move in the direction i want it to often when you use the scale tool it will create a whole bunch of auto fold lines for you and you can move it around but if need be we may invoke autofold to move it where we want now let's say we want to scale this from here so if i hit the scale tool you can see that the grips are not aligned with that surface and if i wanted to scale it just say from the center but maintain that that plane this isn't going to work so there's a couple things we could try here one thing that's always good to at least see how well it works is say a line axis this is going to align the axis with this surface right i'm right clicking on the surface say a line axis and now if i hit the scale tool it is aligned with that surface now it still may not fully be what i want maybe i want it to be more aligned with the length of this wing segment so if that's the case we may come back here and just say let's either grab the access tool or i'll right click on an axis line hit place and then i will manually set the axis now if i hit the scale tool it's aligned pretty well i that and i could let's say manipulate this wing a little bit more let's add one more bend to this and then we'll have that curve finished out so if i take this i'm going to scale it a little bit and i definitely want to be a little more careful of my reference photos but we're just trying to do the rough version here again the autofold is preventing it so i'm going to toggle my auto fold with the move tool and rotate this something that should be pretty close that looks alright again if i hit the scale tool it's not aligned so i'm going to test a line axis probably i wanted again manually place this axis and that should now if i hit the scale tool that should give me a good starting point for the rest of this so if i scale this down now i'd want to reference this other photo of course but that is the idea is that we can continue working on this and shaping this wing once we've changed this axis a couple times it's going to ask us if we want to have that as our new axis for the entire component we're changing it several times you may or may not want to do that but that's the general idea another thing to be aware of when i am looking at this and the axis is different if i wanted to go to a top view to say model this wing if i look at the top view here that may not be what you expect because it's showing me the top view of this changed axis so i'm going to stop editing that component of the top view maybe toggle perspective off and then come back in to this i may have changed that axis so it may not do what i need but that's the idea generally now one thing that we did and this is a bit of a mistake that i'd want to go back and kind of undo if we look at our geometry here when i was scaling this geometry and extending it it doesn't always leave a a line here so for example if i align the axis scale from the center pull again well we did get one but depending on if you scale just from one side you may not create that line now ideally this is you know flat so we could simply fix this by drawing it in but you may need to go back um now stitching but you may need to go back always just be careful of that you have edges to work from or you can have some geometry that so we need to take some more time to fix this up and make sure this wing looks good um but that's the idea we'll leave it there for now one final thing that i want to talk about when using this scale method when we're doing the wing you know we may take this make it a component mirror it to the other side but the fuselage we could either do as a mirrored component or we could do as one object that we're scaling and we just want to make sure we're preserving the center in everything we do so we just want to be very careful that we don't do something this where i scale from the other side if i look at hidden geometry i've pulled a wave that's that center point so maintain that center line so if i scale this scale this down and so forth see i i wasn't careful i'd want to scale from the center and then scale from here it's it's pretty easy to uh you know as you're learning this method to make mistakes that and you'll learn pretty quickly after you've done a few of these and you'll say oops i better go back and manipulate that a little differently so maintain that center line when you do here's one if i said that was the last tip here's maybe the last last tip or suggestion this um if it if you have a pretty cylindrical shape that you're working with it can work fine but depending on the profile you may have something this where it comes to more of a point and again maybe we are creating this as a mirrored component so let's create a component out of this version and let's create a component out of this version and pull them both up similarly so i'm going to take this flip it and do the same here but on one of these because these are different components what i want to show is that when you have a point that is at your center line you may this is a personal preference but you may want to come in and resolve that in a way that it is that comes in perpendicular on both sides something that just a little bit even just so slightly and the reason you may want to do that when i bring this up and i select this and i start to scale it i scaled in and i bring it up some more oh i got to be careful where i'm scaling from if i did something similar here so i bring it up scale it back scale it in full scale so i'm going to turn up in geometry and over here let's hide those center lines and let's smooth some of these others and then we'll do the same over here hide the center lines and smooth smoothies this is primarily visual but what you can see is that we still can see that ridge pretty predominantly now you may know that one thing that could help that is to come in and delete that interior surface and we could do that here as well but even when we do that because this came to a point we kind of have this visual ridge line now if that's something you wanted that would of course be great but just that little bit of an edge here makes this transition smooth so be aware based on how you draw your profiles that can you may want to have just a little bit a small edge that will bring those two mirrored components together in a nice parallel way where they meet as opposed to a ridgeline okay was that um i hope that was i hope that made sense we sort of jumped around there and and i get it this topic this technique of using the scale tool i love it i it's so much fun even after you've practiced fit for a while you'll still sometimes mess up and scale from the wrong grip and and have to fix some things but it opens up a lot of different shapes and objects that you can model using this technique and i wanted to sort of just introduce a couple of the things that you might run into again changing the axis or using mirrored components together go have fun with it if you have questions on it please let us know we'll try to answer and as always if you have questions or suggestions for future topics let us know please do give us that if you so and uh thanks y'all we'll see you next time foreign
