##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: modeling the american flag - warning, there's math involved! video id: tkk3zlolk3u playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkk3zlolk3u uploader: sketchup duration: 797 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:14:24.349919 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here and today the day that this video is launching to youtube it's our independence day here in the united states so in honor of that we're going to model an american flag now i know an american flag or a flag in general might seem kind of simple but when you really think about being precise with your geometry and copying things stars or stripes that are repetitive there's actually a little bit of not only thought that has to go into it to get it right but also it's a really good use of just kind of reinforcing the basic tools so that's what we're going to do let's just go ahead and get right to it so the first thing i need to do is you can see i've got my flagpole here so the idea is once we have our flag we will we'll hoist it we'll put it up um i'm gonna switch right now into i'm gonna start drawing when i draft i to kind of do it in plan view so i'm going to go let's go camera standard views top so now i'm in top view you can see there's my flagpole now what we need to do is start with sort of the basic shape of the flag now i know that uh at least the united states or the american flag is going to be approximately three by five in its proportions so i might go five foot comma three foot and you know kind of rule of thumb is to draw bigger than you need to you can always shrink or change the scale later so i'm actually going to do that now i'm actually going to scale this up by three and then if i want to bring that down i can but at least i know that my proportions are correct so where to start here the first thing i need to do is kind of uh decide where the stars in the stars and stripes go which is a sort of a box off to the side if i draw a midpoint if i hover with my line tool i can kind of split this in half and i know that this is uh i know that this box the blue box where the stars go is going to be 80 percent of halfway so i'm going to do a quick measurement that is if i check my measurements box seven and a half feet eighty percent of that believe it or not it works out to six feet so i'm just gonna start from this end and i'm going to use my move plus my modifier to make a copy of this line i'm going to go over six feet now i know where i can get rid of this that was just a reference so i knew kind of dimensionally you know how big i want to go so from here let's do some stripes now for those that don't know the american flag actually has 13 of them so i'm going to just grab both of these two lines you can see it broke the bottom edge broke when we drew that sort of 80 divider line and i'm going to switch again move plus modifier i'm going to grab this corner lift this up and i'm going to divide this by 13. so i'm just going to double check just to make sure my math is correct one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so that's correct and i know that there are six um on from the bottom up is six stripes and i know from the top down is seven so i'm going to count one two three four five six and then i'm going to go ahead and erase these because this is sort of the blue box that our stars will sit in and then don't need those because those stripes run all the way across you can see now we've got the basic shape maybe i'll zoom in a little bit if that helps you at home we have basically the basic shape that was pretty that was pretty um that was pretty good start let's move on to the stars i'm going to slide this over and i'm going to start with my it's just my basically my polygon tool i think this is maybe the easiest way to do this i'm going to click anywhere i'm not really too concerned about the size i do however want i will scale it afterwards so i'll draw it kind of nice and big and i'm channeling my elementary school days i think when i first learned how to draw a star by just crossing these points essentially just by connecting tip to tip or corner to corner of a pentagon and i'm going to delete the outside lines using the eraser tool and the inside lines again using the eraser tool so now i have a star i know it's too big i'm going to make it a component because anytime you have more than one of something by default just out of habit i'll make it a component so i know this is too big i'm just gonna i just drew it big i'm gonna scale it down i still don't know if that's the right skill i'm going to go ahead and scale it again probably in just a minute but let's use that as a starting point so for those who don't know we have 50 stars and they represent 50 states here in the united states so what i need to do is i need to have 11 across and then i'm going to do um sort of alternating five and four down which would be sort of along the the y-axis so what i want to do is maybe shrink this down one more time just because i already know that's a little bit too large i'm not worried too much about the placement all i need to know is that i need to start in this corner and i want to grab this here and i'm going to pull this over to what is about the same distance i'm going to use the divide tool so if you check my measurements box i'm going to say divide by 10 and the reason why is because if i select these i'm dividing by 10 because i already had one and that'll give me 11 components so that's perfect here again um if i knew exactly the dimension i was working with i can hit the uh you can hit the modifier i'm hitting the modifier which is option on a mac i believe it's control on a pc and then what that'll do is it'll change that i'm centering i'm scaling from the middle and that's a good thing to do for the star in this case i want sort of the all of the the edges to the corners to line up okay so now that we've got that array copied we need to do another array but this time instead of horizontal vertical i'm going to use the move copy tool and i'm just going to kind of eyeball it for this step i'm going to move this star down to what looks to be about equal distance and i want to divide that by four and the reason why is because i need five copies so if i select those now five should be easy for me to count just in case five components that's perfect now the next thing you need to do is shift this one down i would it centered between here and here i don't know where that center line is if i just kind of draw a line from here to here i'm just going to kind of say that that's the midpoint now i'm not sure if that's right but i'm going to call that right i'm using lines instead of guides because i'm just going to delete them after i feel it's faster for me i know that we all have our personal preferences there i'm going to grab this one i'm going to use that same move modifier you can see i'm just using the same sort of basic tools over and over again this time divide that by three so i have my row of five and i have my row of four i don't need any of these only that last one because it tells me where to stop because we already did that distance that measurement it's going to tell me where to stop i'm going to grab both of these here don't need to group them but i guess if i wanted to i could so the next thing to do is we're going to copy all of these together this time i'm going to grab this now we only have 6 on the top row we did 11 but that's because we had 5 in the middle and 6. so this time i'm going to do it differently instead of doing 11. i'm going to copy this over i'm going to divide this by 5 which is going to give me six rows on the top and it's going to give me um again i've got five on sort of that's in between row here and this one was an extra one i'm going to go ahead and select each one of those and delete those and i know that this one's an extra one too because i left that one so if i did that right let's grab all of these and i'm going to say entity info 50 components for 50 stars that is fantastic so that was the first step in the process i'm going to group that you're going to see why in just a second now i this flag but if i copied this and put it on my flagpole right now it would look a little stale because you know usually there's a breeze blowing and the flag has a little bit of movement and whatnot so in this case let's do that let's go the extra step of giving this a little bit of movement i went ahead and copied not copied i went ahead and used the rectangle tool to trace the outline so that i know that this is sort of the exact same proportions as the one above if it's easier for you to see i'm going to switch to perspective mode just for this step and what i want to do is i want to create something that has a wave to it so i'm going to use this as just kind of a temporary guide this little extrusion box here and then and the reason why i'm doing that is i'm really just wanting to create some arcs so i'm using the arc tool i don't know depends on how far i want the wave it may be too much but what i could do is i could always come back here i could always come back and rescale it so if i wanted to do something that and then i wanted to come over here and and do something this i'm not sure exactly what i'm what i'm doing other than the fact that i want about to be there and i kind of want that to be there and you'll see why in just a second let me see if i can get that again there we go because what i really don't what i really need is just this sort of wave form here and i'm going to leave that line you'll see why in just a second i'm going to leave a line there that's what i wanted i wanted a wave because i wanted to push pull this over and push pull this over and then there you go i don't need any of this extra stuff i really because the flag in this case i'm going to pretend i know it's got a thickness in real life but i'm going to pretend that it doesn't for this example let's see if we can make this one face instead of three i'm gonna open up my soften and smooth edges and just kind of push that a little bit and hope that that did sort of heal it or seal it so to speak so that's it from here we're going to drape the line work that we've created on our flat flag i'm going to bring that down onto our curved flag for this we're going to need sandbox tools and i'm going to select this and i'm going to say drape it using the drape tool here and drape it onto this curved mesh now i already know i've done this before so i already knew that this was not going to work for the stars and i don't know why exactly sometimes you know it's the sandbox tools or the drape tool it does things it has a mind of its own i think it's related to the fact that they're components so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select all the component instances i'm going to copy them come out of my group i'm going to paste them in place and move them down along the blue axis and explode them now that's why i made a copy because maybe i wanted to keep my original component intact and then let's try this again drape and stars and there you go it worked don't need those that was just temporary don't need this i'm going to hide it in case i want it later just in case you know to be safe but that's it let's put a splash of color on this bad boy we're going to start with red and we're going to alternate down as we go and then we're going to switch over to white now it's already white the reason why it's showing this is because my shadow settings are darker so actually i don't need to paint that white i could just leave it white if i wanted to and then we can do is come over here and maybe pick a blue so if i group that all together flip that on it's horizontal on its vertical flip it vertically 90 degrees and i'm going to grab a corner here let's see here and we're going to i'm going to grab a copy but yeah i don't have to i could have just moved it you know maybe offset that by two or maybe three inches just kind of looks it's floating a little bit and i don't need that one i'm going to delete that and i don't know about you but i think our flag looks pretty good so i'm going to wrap up by switching my style over to one that i already have set up it's a watermark we're going to finish this off in some style literally and set the camera to two point perspective and now i am ready to celebrate my holiday so again i started this video saying that the flag really sounds kind of simple but when you looked at all those steps especially the fact that there's some math involved the fact that we want to be precise and accurate so we want to make things that make sure that we're using the copy by divide so that we know things are equally spaced this is just such a an important fundamental tool and you can see that once uh you know it and you kind of mastered it it you can apply that to so many different things so in this case we applied it to a flag and we're going to go ahead and give a salute and go watch the fireworks show so hope has a great holiday if you're celebrating other than that have a great um day don't forget to give me a you know let me know what you thought we'll keep that conversation going there and i will see you next time thank you foreign foreign
