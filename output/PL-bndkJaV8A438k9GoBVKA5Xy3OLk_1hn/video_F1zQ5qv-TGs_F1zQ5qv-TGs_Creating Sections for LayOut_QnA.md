##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: creating sections for layout video id: f1zq5qv-tgs playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1zq5qv-tgs uploader: sketchup duration: 842 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:14:14.765838 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this time around let's create some sections in sketchup in preparation for taking them to layout yeah so this will be part one of two videos and here we're gonna just stay in sketchup and create some section cuts and some tips and tricks but this will be kind of a high level overview of creating sections for layout and then in part two uh the next video we'll build out some pages and layout with these sections again this is a high level overview of sections but with that said let's have a look this model is um the whistler library whistler canada it was designed by the firm hcma and let's jump right in i've created this model i've built it with a number of tags they may not necessarily be the ideal tags for what we're doing but that should work out now when i add a section plane i can tap the right arrow key left arrow key up arrow key you can align sections and lock them to the axes so i'm going to tap the right arrow key and cut a section let's say right through these stairs and this will be let's say our east elevation i don't actually know if this is east but we're going to pretend that it is when you create a section this you have a couple options under the view menu you have section planes section cuts which is the poche section sorry section cut is turning the cut on and off in section fill now i've added these options up here on my toolbar for simplicity so here you can see that is the section fill the section cut will actually be cutting through the model and the section plane is turning this on and off now because this is along the axis i could let's say jump through some of my views find the right one go up to camera term perspective off and i've got my orthographic elevation however that said i'm going to turn my section plane back on if this was not on the axis you can right click on a section plane and say align view and that's really handy i say especially if you have suction cuts that are not on an elevation or if you just want have a sec several suction cuts and just one automatically jump to one so with this setup i'm pretty close to what we want maybe i don't i may add people let's say in layout but the one thing i'll do here is uh let's turn some of the entourage elements off and then let's change the style just so that we'll create kind of a few different styles this one will just be a simple black and white style um i think i will simply turn the axis off the one other thing that we may want to do here i think i will leave this as it is but we might want to turn shadows on and then adjust them here now you do have some control in layout but it will probably be to our advantage to do that here if we wanted them i say i'm actually going to not uh not bother with shadows but go ahead and do that and then we'll go to scenes and save this now in layout one of the things that we'll do is we'll clean up some of this other the other pieces here so that this looks a little better it's really helpful to have tags that you can turn on and off and can those carry over the layout but some of this stuff will clean up in layout directly so that's a simple introduction to creating a section plane let's create another creative floor plan i'm going to turn my previous style back on and turn that section cut off now this section let's uh say we want to put it right around here and i'm going to tap the up arrow key and so we'll go to a top down view when i look at this i think what i want to do on this one is turn off some of this other some of the surrounding area here so let's turn off all the entourage which will turn off the ground let's turn off let's say the sidewalk and the garage level i'm going to generally fill my view here now a couple things that you can do i i actually this style um i will turn off the action display this looks fine i'm actually going to save this as a scene right now but you could some of the options you have let's say in the styles is to come in and say well if your section fill i think i just got a dark gray as a section field but you can change this to anything you would and another thing to note uh particularly in this view i'm going to dig into my model now the way i built this um originally probably wasn't set up very well for breaking it down because i think the floor and the walls i was i was just going off of a um some of the drawings i could find but when i look at the floor now i sort of broke it out separately if i hide the rest of the model you can see that this is just a really basic floor but i have broken it around broken it surface so that i can have some different materials and that's just aligned with the walls but it could be really helpful to build your model out you know as different um walls floors elements again different things you may want to turn on and off the other thing to point out here is that these doors i did put them on their own tag but we did a skill builder just within the past few weeks about how you could take something a door and combine several components inside it so i could have a closed door an open door a door swing symbol or various elements put those on different tags and then import that entire component and then i'd be able to close all the doors at once open them at once so if that sounds something interesting and you haven't seen that scale builder go check out the skill builder just uh within the last few weeks all right so we've got our floor plan our elevation let's do one more so i'm going to turn perspective back on and toggle these off let's say in this one it's um we kind of want an illustrated look where we cut a section plane just through the roof so that we can look inside the building and highlight something well a section plane will cut through whatever context you put it in as we've seen so far the section planes we've just put them on basically in the model as a whole so anything we put just cuts through the entire model but if we wanted to we could go into a group or component and cut just through that however and if i examine this it looks my roof i've got my roof i've got the the beams that's supported i've got a different piece for a roof so i'm going to combine all of those into one group so select the ceiling the beams this roof and i'm going to group those together and let me put those back on the roof layer roof tag old habits now if i wanted to put this section cut aligned with let's say this part of the building that's not actually aligned with the axis and there's a couple ways that we might try this one is we could simply put a a section maybe aligned with here and then i take this section i can move it in and right click on it and reverse let me do it up here and reverse so remember that you can reverse a section cut and it might be easier in our case to do that i'm gonna just to show one other way we could do this i'm going to turn off the roof assembly and let's say i put a section cut using the inside and it's facing the right way and i pull it back a little bit i'm going to cut this out of the model so i could go edit cut or use a cup board shortcut i'm going to turn the roof assembly back on and then i'm going to enter that roof assembly and paste it in place you can copy and paste section cuts uh just anything else so by pasting it goes exactly where i wanted it earlier and it's cutting just the context of the roof group that i've entered so before let's turn the section planes off choose a view i don't know if shadows at this point might be useful or not actually let's turn our entourage back on this looks fairly dark uh so let's lighten these shadows up something that and let's say you know this is just a we'll use this as an illustration purpose being able to cut just through the roof so view something this and i'm going to save that as a scene now let's double check make sure these are all working correctly so we've got our floor plan our east elevation all right perfect that we can take the layout and build some pages from great we're set up i say in the next video we will take these same examples take them over to layout and build some pages out um let us know if you have questions on anything we covered here say there's actually more we could do with sections and certainly uh some advanced tips if you were going to do um in-depth construction documentation but this is a good introduction if you have any other questions in general or any suggestions for other things that we can do in these videos please let us know in the comments as always give us a a and thanks all for joining us we'll see in the next one foreign foreign
