##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don’t hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter — the line will snap to that precise length.


✅ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You’ll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp’s way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


⚠️ Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it’s an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry — you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about scaling so i said scaling not quite as simple as just using the scaling tool what i'm actually talking about is going in and taking something and making it a specific size an exact scale so uh not necessarily make it bigger just make it smaller 50% size it was if i want to make something exactly a specific dimension a specific scale we'll take a look at how to do that right now all right so as with most things in sketchup there's a couple different ways i could go about this so here i have some rulers i chose rulers because they have to be a specific size uh based on what's here you can see they're very very big right so this is supposed to be 150 mm i'm not a metric guy as you know but i will say that i'm pretty sure 150 mm is nowhere near this big so these are obviously modeled very large so we've talked about this on some other videos there are cases we we in general with sketchup if we're doing an architectural model we do recommend modeling full size it's the easiest way to go about it but there are situations where you might model larger or smaller than full size so if i have something that's real small with a lot of small small detail uh i might have to scale up when i model so that's looks these were maybe modeled extra large to uh allow for a bunch of small detail little tick marks that kind of stuff the other thing would be if i was modeling something super big i might have to bring it down so if i wanted to you know i don't know model a planet or something i might model that much smaller than it is regardless if i ever model something outside of the standard size and those of you who watch our live models may know that i tend to hop in and just start modeling to get my shapes in and i don't worry about specific sizes sometimes until later on uh there may be a point where you have to scale something or or change the size of it so i have a couple different rulers here so the one at the top you can see goes from zero all the way up to 150 this is 140 plus there's 10 tick marks 150 millim now there is a scale command and we have a scale command for a reason to scale things that's right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select this i'm going to select it on the outside you see i'm on the outside of the component if i double click i come in here and then i actually have some the tick marks the numbers the geometry all separate i'm going to select on the outside of that so the the outside container and i'm going to click on scale all right so with scale you have all these sets of handles right so i can i can go in and i can scale and we've done again this is in we have a a square one video for the scale tool it's super simple how it works a lot of times when we use scale we do percentages so if i grab uh an a corner this i start scale it down and say i want to go to 05 and see down there in the scale in the corner right there it's scaling down and i could type in 0.5 it would make it half as big or i could type two which would make it twice as big but what we want is a specific scale we want from the end to end to be 150 mm so what i would do in that case is i grab this middle one see it's it's really important that i grab the middle one cu what i want to tell it is from that opposite handle to this handle is exactly 150 mm so i'm going to click and start dragging this now i don't want to squish it and make it 150 mm so i'm going to tap the modifier key to keep this scaled so in this case it is shift so if i hold shift i'm dragging down this and i'm going to release it and then then i'm going to type the exact scale i want i want that to be 150 mm so 150m enter and there it goes little teeny tiny now that is from this side to this side 150 mm or just under six inch so that works great for this one look how small it is look how big this is so obviously this one's going to be an issue right if i take this and i go all right scale it down and we're going to go this way do the exact same thing shift scale that direction and type 150 mm all right what happens with that well it scaled it down now my things are really far apart so let's gra let's grab this guy right here let's go move him over here and you'll see right away end to end they're the same see that so let's grab this guy right by the end and we'll put it right up next to this one and and n to end they're exactly the same which means something's not right here right because this is not 150 m this is 1 mm plus whatever this is 20 something more millimeters out here to the end so that's not going to work in this case this is wrong so let's look out here we have one more i want to scale this so that it is 150 mm from the end of the ruler to this without to mess with what's over here so what i'm going to do is i'm going to double click that's going to open up the ruler so i'm in now this is where i have i said these different these different groups that have this other stuff in here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab my tape measure tool not scale but tape measure and i'm going to go from this corner zoom in here at that corner and i'm going to click to so right now uh i'm going to come to right there and i'm going to click right there and it did give me see it gave me that that uh that guide there uh i'm going to hit command z um actually i'm going to back up one more step this is a copy of this component that i scaled so i'm going to go ahead right click and say make unique so that's going to say that uh if i make a change here it's not going to mess with this little guy i have up here either so by making it unique i did that and then i'm going to go all right one more time so what i'm going to do is i'm going to down here i have the option of i can click option i'm on mac so option to toggle create guides if i tap option once see that little plus goes away plus says make a guide without the guide i'm just in tape measure mode and i'm going to click here and i'm going to click right here and then type 150 mm and hit enter it's going to come up and say do you want to resize the active group that's the group i'm in i'm going to hit yes o it got small let's check it out let's zoom in here yeah that looks it could be right so if i go from here to here yeah just about 6 in and if i go grab oh really got to zoom out i'm grab both these just bring them down here closer where is it there we are all right so if i grab this one not the one i know is wrong i'm not gna i'm going to kind of abandon that but if i grab this one grab by the corner and then oops grab by the corner put that right up here here what i should see is my marks oh i grabbed the wrong one that's one i didn't want let's grab this one second tries a charm that's what they say all right so if i d grab this one right next to this one i should see my marks lining up all the way down even though i scale them two different ways this guy was scaled with the scale command and this one with the tape measure so depending on the content you have to scale there's different ways to go about it um the general rule of thumb is that container the outside geometry when you hit scale it's going to say okay absolute outside these this is what i'm resizing if that outside geometry can be brought to a specific dimension then go ahead and use scale if not if you're scaling about some intermediate geometry that falls inside that container then you want to use the tape measure and specify a span across there generally speaking i say grab the biggest span you can and scale it uh if we go real small that's where maybe rounding and that kind of thing fractional increments might end up causing a problem and you'd be a little bit off so usually i usually scale the biggest thing that i know for a fact is correct uh and well t there we go so uh yeah hopefully that works for you uh let me know if that scaling works for you if you have a different way of scaling i love to hear that too put in the comments down below let me know how you to scale and uh if you haven't done this before let me know that too let me know this worked out for you and you know while you're clicking around go ahead and this with somebody i really appreciate when you get a chance to do that uh and in the comments if you are leaving a let me know about some other ideas of things you might have what are some modeling techniques you've wondered about or something that you found that you thought were good and you want to with other people we making these videos a lot we them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you
