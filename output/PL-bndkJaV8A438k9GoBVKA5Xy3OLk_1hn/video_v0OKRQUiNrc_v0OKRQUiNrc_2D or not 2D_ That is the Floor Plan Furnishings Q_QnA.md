##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: 2d or not 2d? that is the floor plan furnishings question video id: v0okrquinrc playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0okrquinrc uploader: sketchup duration: 642 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:05:25.822554 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today i want to with you some of my tips for combining both 2d and 3d objects into one component in order to get the best of both worlds when creating floor plans right here in sketchup so when i say best of both worlds i mean that whether you it or not we have to work at some point with 2d information even though we're a 3d modeling app and i say information both on the front end so you might get something a four plan that was drawn in an application cad in which case you have cad blocks which then become sketchup components that's a 2d block that you're starting with before you begin to work in 3d whether you're building something from scratch or you're replacing it with an object from 3d warehouse now on the other end we also want to think about when we go to layout we might be taking our custombuilt furnishing or our floor plan and then communicating the design with somebody else also again in 2d so whether it's on the front end the middle the back end we're going to work back and forth between 2d and 3d and i want to with you my process for doing that right now so i've got a floor plan here um this is a co-working space it's kind of a commercial interiors that we're going to work on and i've got a few objects that some of these things i built from scratch and some things that i found online so what i want to do is kind of cover a what i think is a common workflow which is that you're starting with a floor plan that maybe was done in a program cad and then now you need to turn it into a 3d model so if i'm going to change my camera perspective to ortho for this and i may be switching back and forth but just so you know because we're talking about floor plans i'm probably going to look at it in plan view so looks pretty good in plan view obviously we're sketchup we're 3d when you tilt it yeah not so much so let's go ahead and get started converting our 2d plan into a 3d one before i do that i want to kind of also state or show that i have two tags set up one of them is called furniture 2d and one is 3d and that's because i want to separate i want to kind of pre-think about organizing my pl plan information on two different tags and you'll see why here so let's just go ahead and do it i'm going to take this table i'm going to copy it and then i'm going to go into my table group and i'm going to go grab find this table symbol which is really just a rectangle and paste my table right in to the table and chairs component and you can see because it's a component it repeats it for all of them now before i pop out of here i am going to assign this 3d table to my 3d furnishings tag and if i want to i don't have to but sometimes i will turn color by tag on just to make sure that that was done properly and you can see i've already got my my table assigned to the 2d tag now if it's not for some reason we can just go ahead and undo that i'll just undo that step just to show you how easy that is so we can go ahead and assign the 2d and then you can see the color change to blue and the 3d once again and the color changes to this kind of yellow color that just shows me that i can then toggle them back and forth or on and off so let's do um a couple more let's grab this plant and this chair so let's do the chair first show you how kind of easy this is go back into that component i copied that chair i'm just go and paste this here right there and i'm probably going to need to rotate that 90¬∞ so it's sort of facing the right way and then there you go now it's pink by default that's untagged that just kind of tells me pink means untagged go ahead or red depending on how you perceive this color i'm going to go ahead and put that on the 3d tag again same thing super simple and let's do one more while we're at it just because i think it helps to be able to see a few different examples this one has not been placed on a tag so what we want to do is grab this one again same thing 3d for the plant and 2d for the symbol so when we switch to plan view using keyboard shortcut for that you can see right now we've got both of them overlapping so what i want to do is i'm probably not going to show both at the same time i have to decide which that i want to show let's go and turn the 2d off and assume that i did all this work making this fl plan in 3d why would i not show that in 3d well one reason is because while it looks pretty good um this may or may not read as a plant first of all if you look at the plant symbol and second of all the chair well fairly simple it is a 3d chair and so if i try to add something dimensions to this and say okay i want this chair i want these chairs spaced you know certain you can see i'm having trouble finding it's trying to snap to all this sort of hidden geometry because this is a 3d chair after all so if i started if i snap here to here my dimension string may be a little bit off so i'm having a little bit of trouble maybe i can find that center point if i zoom in but again now i'm not doing my dimensions i wouldn't normally do them here i would do them in layout but just dimensioning to a 3d object might be a little bit trickier so if i compare that to the 2d version and i switch to my dimension you can see i have no problems at all it just grabs that center point and there we go we're good to go so same thing here if i wanted to go from the edge of the table to say the center of the chair that's super super easy because i'm dimensioning on just a 2d a very simple sort of 2d object and besides dimensions also just visually the style by having them separate you can just kind of control the visibility for example this plant reads more as a potted palm whereas if you go to the 3d symbol you know with all this extra geometry and stuff it may or may not read the way you want it to so just something to think about again we can always combine this method and you can have some objects that you say let's let the 3d read that works better or others let's let the 2d read or in this case of the table if you have just a rectangle doesn't really matter what reads um for the table um unless of course you want to show the chairs underneath it in which case having them sit on the same plane is the advantage so i want to show you one more example just to kind of reiterate this point and it's but for a slightly different reason i'm going to grab this couch over here and i want to go ahead and place this couch inside of this couch group or this couch component going to place that in there and i'm going to flip that around and there we go okay so now this c isn't super super high poly but if i turn my hidden geometry on you can see that it is high enough that i may not want to send this to layout for example and then if i rendering my floor plans in vector mode so that i can get that crisp clean line that can be edited in a pdf editor or something that this is a little bit more information than i probably need to render in vexter so if i'm rendering in raster that's probably fine but in this case it's i'm i'm basically asking layout to do a lot more work because it has to render every single one of these edges when um it's not really buying me anything when you kind of zoom out and you see it at this level so in this case this would just be another example of and i skipped this step because i was talking but i need to put this on the furniture 3d tag so it disappears and this would just be another example where i'm better off working with the more simplistic 2d symbol rather than the 3d one um that's just going to maybe increase my render times later depending on what i'm trying to do with it so something to think about and lastly i said is that the 2d um both directions now we can also start with for example if i wanted to start with a 3d object i can also embed a 2d object into this so whether this is handdrawn or imported cad block i'm just going to grab steel for myself over here i've got this door swing you can also come back later after the fact after your model's built and come in and place 2d objects just got to orient it correctly into the model and then here go uh same thing i would just double check to make sure that this is placed on the 2d tag and i would make sure that this everything else besides those two doors is put on the 3d tag and i will check that the color and that looks pretty good so the cool thing about that is if i wanted to go into plan view this now i can choose to show the door swing or not just by toggling that tag on and off again if i wanted to add if i wanted to dash that if you want wanted to show that show it is not really there because it's not physically there it's just kind of a representation of an idea of the swing um you can always change the line type and i just being able to control that separately from the 3d object so i want to stop there because i think you get the idea but i do want to also at the same time plug uh if you liked what you learned here or you want to learn a little bit more about this model that i'm working on or that i built the model of where we got the components and where we got the furnishings and how to build some of these objects for from scratch i do want to kind of plug really quick learn. sketchup.com check that out what you're going to get is sketchup campus has a bunch of free courses for learning um some of our core fundamentals but also some of the more complex industry specific stuff i just covered here in commercial interiors so if you click on that course enroll for free and it's got all kinds of cool stuff in addition to the tips that i just shared with you um got a lot more information about starting from scratch and taking a floor plan all the way to the finish line i'm going to leave you there i just want to say as always i hope these tips are helpful if you work a different way if you've got a different way to do it and you say actually combining two things in one component is not a good idea and here's because here's why i'd to know that so leave a below let us know what you think either way because these videos as much as we making them uh we it better when it's something you want to see so i'm going to say thanks and i will see you all next time [music]
