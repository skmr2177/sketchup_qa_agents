##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

2025-07-22t15:07:45.128197 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , it's , and today, we're going to model a business card holder. so i can already hear the comments, ‚Äúi already have a business card holder.‚Äù ‚Äúi don't use paper business cards.‚Äù ‚Äúthat's too simple.‚Äù the goal here is to give some good instructions on something that has to be modeled with some precision. and we'll actually talk about how to avoid exact precision, because there's some spots where we want a little bit of slop. the idea here is not necessarily to get to the end result, but to practice modeling. so if you're an experienced modeler who wants to kind of just keep on on top of your game. and this is something different from what normally model, it's a good practice to keep, you know, just keep going. keep learning with modeling. if you're a brand new user, then this is a. perfect thing. this is a simple‚Äî i'm i don't know i don't know how long this video will be ten, 15 minutes at most, that walk through every single step. so let's do it. let's hop in. let's make this thing. all right. so first thing we're do is we're going to create a business card. so i'm just going to come in here and zoom down on the ground. so keep a foot okay. so business cards about that big. i'm going to draw. a business card. so a business card is 3.5in, so 3.5 by 2 inches, 2. and it's that rectangle. so i'm just going to go that. so yes i could have used the rectangle tool. and no i did not. all right. so this is a business card obviously a real business card has some thickness. i'm not interested in the thickness of a card. i'm interested in the thickness of a stack of cards. so i want to have, you know, some space to put a handful of business cards in here. so let's go ahead and pull this up what's that . yeah 3/8 of an inch. let's go 3/8 of an inch. all right. and i'm going to. grab that. and make it a group. all right. so what i want right now i'm going to use rotate real quick just to bring this up. right. what i want is a thing that's going to hold this. now i'm almost ready to start building, but there's a couple things i want to do. one is if my business hold card holder, if the holder is exactly three and a half inches, these can be pretty snug, especially if i do 3d print it. and sometimes 3d printing material swirls a little bit as you print because it heats up and cools down, that kind of stuff. so that might be a little bit tight. so i'm going to come in here and i'm going to give it, not a lot, but let's say an 1/8 inch extra on the edge. that's going to just let me, you know, have a little bit of extra space. so there's room for it, but not so much that my cards are gonna slide around. and i'm going to see them, you know, all over the place. the other thing i want to do is i want to take this, and i want to lean them back slightly. i don't want them just facing straight up. so i going to say 20, 20 degrees. all right. so what i've created now is basically the negative space i want to maintain when i create this business card holder. so when i make this thing, i don't want it to intrude on any of this space. so this means i can do a couple things. one thing i could do is i could just model a you know, i could come in here and just. go, okay, here is this, and we'll go this. and then i can use solid tools, just carve that out and could be done. that's an option. i'm going to go a little bit further than that. we're going to actually create something that's somewhat aesthetically pleasing. so we're gonna do that by tracing around this. so again we're intentionally a little large this way we are‚Äîkind of an arbitrary amount this way at 3/8 of an inch. you know, how many cards is that? i don't even know. and then we're exactly the height of a business card here. so as we make our business card holder, we can decide: is it going to go past the card? is it going to stay low? we can make that decision as we go. so what i'm going to do is i'm. going to come in here and i‚Äôm going to trace across the bottom with an edge. i'm going to come up here, let's see a half an inch. yeah, that sounds good. 1/2‚Äù. enter. and then i'm going to come straight out this way. i'm going to come out i want to have a. some thickness on this. let's say, you know, actually, let's do this way. this will be kind of cool. this will look nice. i'm going to come out perpendicular to that by hovering over this edge and coming out to where 90 degrees is. it'll snap to pink, and i'm going to come out this way. , say, quarter inch. see how that looks? no, that's too far up. i want to cut that in half. so i'm going to go reference the middle. that's going to be an eighth of an inch. and i'm going to drag that down. i'm going to go along this. all right. cool. i'm going to come here. this is the lowest point of the cards. i want that to drop down. i this eighth inch. when i 3d print stuff an eighth inch wall is a pretty decent thickness. it's heavy duty enough that it's not going to, you know, warp or break easy. but it's not so big i'm wasting filament, so i'm gonna stick with that eighth inch, dimension for my thickness. i'm gonna come here, i'm gonna drop this down an eighth of an inch, and i run this over that. all right, so let's grab all that and that, and we'll bring that up. it's under ground this way. it's a little bit gray on the bottom there. all right, so there we go. so now looking at from the side this is what the bottom of my my holder is going to look . so let's, let's let's come up here i'm just going to draw a line that. let me go this way. same thing eight inch i'm going to bring that down that. i run lines long all the time rather than trying to meet up this. the problem with just trying to kind of meet up and make sure, well, this is snapping perfectly beautifully, no problem at all. but if i have multiple points in here or real close to , other geometry, i can sometimes grab the wrong one if i‚Äôm out too far. so if i know i want to come along the green axis i'll just run long this. then real quick, turn on erase and just erase those two pieces. so, your call, though. you don't have to do what i do. you, you be you. you do your thing. all right, so there we go. that looks pretty good. i think what i'm going to do. so what i want to do is i'm take this geometry and run it along that to hold the business card. but i think, okay, i just did that so i'm not going to think about it anymore. i'm going to take this and bring it down a quarter inch. 1/4 enter. all right. so there we go. so now when i do get down to that last card, it's gonna be real easy to grab it. i have a little bit of room for my finger to slip over and grab it. that looks cool. okay. something i don't so much. obviously, i need a lip here to hold the bottom, but i'm covering up a good portion of what would be on my business card with this lip. so you could do a couple things. one is i could bring it down lower, which is okay. problem with that is then it's more likely the cards will fall out. so what i do instead is i want to do something this. i'm going to go to the middle. i'm going to drop, i'm gonna drop all the way down. i'm going to go inference this point right here. and i'm going to come over this way one inch and i bring it up that. yeah. i'm going to take that, option copy it over to here. that looks good. and then i'll just push this back that. get rid of that there. so now we can actually see what's in there. i'm going to go a little further i that, i that look, but i'm going to get some, get some more space. i'm going to grab this corner but drag it over this way a half inch. and this one. this way a half inch. yeah. see there. so now my cards are in there nice and secure. they're held in. i know i don't have anything on the end yet. that's, that's still coming. they're in there nice and secure. and i could still see the bulk of what's on my card. i'm covering up a little bit in the corners, but most of what i want to show, my logo or my information, is still going to be visible in here. so let's, let's keep going. let's get the ends on here. so this right now this is all loose geometry and this is a group. so i can kind of work with this a little bit. i can just take that over that. and then i'm going to take this out again, that eighth of an inch that i'm trying to use for my material. and then i can also grab this, pull this out that. and then, if i erase these edges. that all goes together. so now it's holding that in there. if i want to check inside here. i can always temporarily hide this piece. just make sure everything looks good there. yep. all right. i‚Äôm going to ctrl z to undo that and then do the same thing over here. just a quick edge across. perpendicular to that. pull it out an eighth of an inch. pull this out to the same amount and then erase those extra edges. good. that looks pretty cool. now i'm it's possible, but it's unlikely that it's going to stay standing upright with this little tiny foot right here. so let's get some more . i'm just going to come back this. i'm going to go up to where it's. something that, and then we'll pull that through. i could type in eight inch again, or i could just come over right here and then erase that. i‚Äôll have a line down here. erase that. that's going to give it enough of a leg to stand on. no, i was going to say no pun intended, but i totally said that as a pun, so, yeah. take that how you . i'm going to bring this over an eight inch too. boom. boom. and there we go. all right, let me. take this and hide this again. that looks pretty good. that looks solid. it's not solid. it's actually. wide open. so i‚Äôm not‚Äî i could come in here and i could close up this right here. so it's one big, solid piece. downside of that, of course, is that's a lot of extra material to print. so i'm not going to do that. i'm going to keep it open this. and i think that this 20 degrees is a shallow enough angle that most 3d printers could print that without any . same thing here, because i'm coming up. i don‚Äôt need that edge. i'm coming up here at 20 degrees. i think all of this could be printed with no . so i could actually sit this right flat on the print bed, print it in place as one piece, no supports or anything. and have a finished business card holder, in, i don‚Äôt know, maybe a couple hours of printing, something that. hour and a half. i‚Äôm going to triple click and make it a group. and if i do want to make sure this is actually 3d printable, i would want to come up here and go to entity info make sure it says solid group. it currently doesn't. so in, sketchup for web or with the extension solid inspector i can always come in here and i can check and see what the problem is, and it's telling me that i do have a stray edge somewhere in here. i could hit fix all, or i could turn on x-ray, and i could see where it is. and you can see it's right there. so if i turn this off, see, i got that extra edge is floating in there and i can erase that. all right with that. now we have a solid group. perfect. we could take that then, if i wanted to 3d print‚Äîwe've done this in other videos, this is not the point of the video‚Äîbut we could take that, export it as an stl, take it in a slicer, print it out and have this sitting on my desktop ready to hand out my cards. i said, in an hour and a half or so. if you wanted, you could take this further. i could put some 3d text right here. i just have to make sure i merge it into the geometry. if i wanted to take this longer, i could take this up higher than the business card and put a logo up there. something that. but there you go. pretty simple. pretty easy. basic modeling tutorial. but, you get what you, yeah. i mean, not bad for ten minutes, huh? ten minutes. half an hour‚Äîor an hour and a half on the printer, and you got your own, custom made, one of a kind business card holder. well, one of a kind, except for other people who along with this and have one, including myself. but, yeah. there you go. again, a fun little quick modeling practice thing. i do think that if you're going to get good at sketchup, the best way to do that is really to just get in there and use it. stuff this, if you can spend a couple minutes modeling something that has some real world dimensions to it, it's fun to do just fantasy models, right? just model a castle or whatever. that's a that's a great time. but sometimes a little bit of precision is a good way to get good at, you know, precision modeling. makes sense, right? but this in particular, i said, we had very specific dimensions. but at the same time, we want to give ourselves a little bit of space so things work together. we've got to be conscious of how thick the walls of things are, that kind of thing. so. yeah, try it out. let me know what you think of this. do you this kind of modeling practice? this is a fun way to spend ten minutes. tell us what you think about this, because we're always playing with our video types, making sure you get what you want to see, what you want to watch. and, we know that most by hearing from you. if you the video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly though, i said, leave us a . let me know what you think of this. if you think there's some other model that would make a good video this, or if there's a whole other topic or type of video you think we should make that we haven't yet. let us know about that down there too. we making these videos a lot, but we an even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
