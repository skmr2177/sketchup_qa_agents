# Top 5 Push/Pull Tips - Q&A Guide

## Tutorial Overview
This tutorial covers five essential tips for using the Push/Pull tool in SketchUp, including how it works with different geometry types, modifier keys, connected geometry, and common challenges like pushing through walls. The tutorial demonstrates advanced techniques that many users may not be aware of.

## Q&A Pairs

### 1. What is the first tip about using the most recent version of SketchUp for Push/Pull?
**Answer:** The tutorial emphasizes using the most recent version because "changes have been made to push pull in the previous few versions that make it so that you're more likely to get proper faces on push pulls." the tutorial demonstrates that newer versions automatically make faces white (outside) regardless of pull direction, while older versions (2018-19) might create gray faces in certain directions.

### 2. How does the tutorial demonstrate Push/Pull behavior with standalone faces?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates two simple rectangular faces - one flat and one rotated - and demonstrates that when using Push/Pull on any standalone face, "the bottom turns white, everything around it is now the outside" creating a six-faced box that "could be grouped and become a solid." This happens regardless of whether the face is flat or at an angle.

### 3. What does the tutorial explain about Push/Pull with connected geometry?
**Answer:** The tutorial demonstrates that when geometry is "completely connected to other geometry," Push/Pull assumes the face is "on a surface of some larger geometry" and "pulls out of that surface and does not make a new face." The tool treats it as part of a larger world rather than a standalone shape, like "pulling a sink down or pushing a window in."

### 4. What are the two modifier keys for Push/Pull and what do they do?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates two modifier keys: "toggle create new starting face" and "toggle stretch mode." The first creates brand new faces when pulling, indicated by a plus sign next to the cursor, while the second stretches existing geometry by moving connected edges rather than creating perpendicular sides, shown by a face with arrow icon.

### 5. How does the tutorial demonstrate the "create new starting face" modifier?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates tapping the modifier key to get a "little plus right next to your cursor" and when pulling up, it creates "brand new faces" as if it were a new surface. The tutorial demonstrates this by creating a unique cubby design and notes that this creates interior geometry, making the shape no longer solid.

### 6. What does the tutorial explain about the "stretch mode" modifier?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates that stretch mode "grabs the edges that are already connected and just pulls it with" rather than creating new perpendicular sides. It moves geometry "like it's push pulling" but stretches existing edges, going "perfectly 90 degrees to wherever the face was" without needing additional geometry or inference.

### 7. How does the tutorial demonstrate Push/Pull limitations with nearby geometry?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates that certain geometry "fills the whole edge" and stops Push/Pull from going past it. The tutorial demonstrates this with steps where pulling up stops at a certain height and "I can't inference up to this." the tutorial demonstrates the common workaround of doing multiple Push/Pull operations.

### 8. How does the tutorial solve the problem of Push/Pull stopping at geometry?
**Answer:** The tutorial demonstrates using the "toggle create new starting face" modifier to "push past geometry where normal Push Pull will stop and limit you." This creates new geometry that "doesn't care about the inferencing or the limitations of that previous geometry" allowing users to type exact dimensions like "five foot enter."

### 9. What does the tutorial show about pushing through walls?
**Answer:** The tutorial demonstrates that with perpendicular walls, users can "inference to the back" and snap through to the opposite face. the tutorial demonstrates this works by snapping to corners which provide "very simple snap points" and works as long as the wall is perpendicular to world axes.

### 10. How does the tutorial handle non-perpendicular walls?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates that with non-perpendicular walls, users get "weird stuff" when trying to inference the back wall, with faces "changing color and running through." The tutorial demonstrates the solution: drag geometry through, triple-click to select all, right-click "intersect face with selection," then delete the unwanted parts.

### 11. What does the tutorial explain about the difference between Push/Pull and Move for vertical movement?
**Answer:** The tutorial acknowledges that Move can do similar vertical movement but notes that with Move, users "have to make sure I lock into that vertical otherwise it can bounce off and connect to other geometry on accident." Push/Pull with stretch mode "only goes directly normal to a surface" providing more controlled movement.

### 12. How does the tutorial demonstrate the visual feedback for modifier keys?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates that modifier keys provide visual indicators: "toggle create new starting face" shows "a little plus right next to your cursor" and "toggle stretch mode" shows "a face with an arrow pointing away from it." These icons help users know which modifier is active before performing the operation.

### 13. What does the tutorial explain about the consequences of using "create new starting face"?
**Answer:** The tutorial demonstrates that using this modifier "is not a solid shape anymore because it has interior geometry." the tutorial demonstrates with x-ray mode that "these two faces are in here" making it impossible to use solid tools on the resulting geometry, but useful for intentionally adding geometry on top.

### 14. How does the tutorial demonstrate the mathematical advantage of modifier keys?
**Answer:** the tutorial demonstrates that when Push/Pull stops at "four foot four and a quarter" due to geometry limitations, using the modifier key allows typing "five foot enter" to get exactly five feet without having to "do math" to calculate the remainder. This provides precise control even when geometry blocks normal Push/Pull.

### 15. What does the tutorial emphasize about the importance of modifier keys?
**Answer:** The tutorial stresses that "modifier keys are so important and yet it seems to be one of the last things people learn or acknowledge exist." the tutorial highlights that "every command you use in SketchUp is going to list some modifier keys down at the bottom" and they change depending on whether users are on Windows or Mac.
