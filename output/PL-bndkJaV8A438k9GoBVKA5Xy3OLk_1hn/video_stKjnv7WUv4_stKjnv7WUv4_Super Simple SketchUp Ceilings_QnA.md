##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today we're going to take a look at modeling some ceilings so this came up we did a a a video a couple weeks ago about making ceiling plans inside of layout and that was for vaulted ceilings on uh on roofs and that kind of thing but the question came well how do we frame down ceilings how do we model ceilings that come down um you'd see in a basement or or something that how do we go about that process and i figured well let's do that let's let's let's answer that question by by doing it let's in fact let's do it right now let's stop talking go all right so i have a very very simple room here this is just a little little pretend basement room and i got some duct work or some steel beams or whatever there's stuff up here that drops the assumption is of course that there's another floor you know up above this and and this is the place we're in so i didn't have that in there because i being able to look down from above but in this situation how would we come in and just frame down so that we're underneath here um i'm going to get rid of this because i don't i don't need to see that so really i want to what i want to look at is okay if i drop a line down i'm going to hold down the shift to lock that so this is about 10 in so i'm going to say i want to drop down at least 12 in to frame some kind of a ceiling here there's a couple options what we could do we could actually do something that is framed down so as long as there's you know an inch and a half for some flat tu by members and then a half inch of drywall so if i come down if i came down 12 ines i could actually do that pretty easy so this could be as simple as this i could come down 12 in typ 12 enter and then from there i could just kind of come across here cross here cross here and you know what with that if we're looking for the mvp the minimum viable product the least possible work that would work right that gives us uh a ceiling plane i'd probably want to grab this group it um i'm going to go into my tags and and make some stuff i'm going to put in a few ceiling layers ceiling one and then whoops i didn't hit enter ceiling one enter ceiling 2 enter and we'll do a third one and we'll call this one ceiling five ah kidding ceiling three okay so i'm going to take this minimum ceiling and we're just going to assign that to ceiling one and then i can turn that off that so that works that's not a bad solution that is that that's going to be you know you know that could be how i put that in um let's look at some other options so let's say i do want to frame it down maybe i want to put some volume in or recess some lighting this this stuff right here does cause an issue for me obviously i can't frame into where this beam or the hvac is but i could create a volume that i can play in a little bit by doing something more this so if i come in here and i'm just going to draw an edge across we're going to come down to 12 in same same depth for the ceiling 12 in and go that and then i could push this back here this what this gives us is rather than just that one plane this gives us a volume right so we could actually do some stuff inside of here so if i wanted to i could come in and do something um you know i'm going to put a rectangle that and then push that maybe all the way up to the top or we'll go we'll go up 11.5 there we go and i could give myself that little recess right so i could i could actually have a little vault a little higher space up there and to take that a little bit further as well i could even grab this i'm going to bring this down 8 in select and delete that and then we'll pull these out i don't know 3 in something that and what that will do that gives me just a little you know a little lighting recess so i could in that volume i could actually have you know i it wouldn't sketch up doesn't place lights but i could go into my render or something and put a put a a lighting a light across those spots which would put light up into that recess and kind of make that section glow but pretty easy to do one of the things i might want to do if i'm playing with this i arbitrarily drew a rectangle but obviously i'd want to be more if i want to be more specific i could work in x-ray mode too cuz then i can actually see how close am i to this so if i'm framing down and if i want to get the most possible volume i could take you know these two pieces and just pull them this direction a little bit closer there so same thing here grab that slide it back that and this is give me my biggest possible uh space right there that one actually no it actually didn't click to it so turn x-ray off there we go i got my biggest possible space i might maybe want to give myself a little another couple of inches or something this bring this another three inches out little little more space for lighting in that ledge and uh with that obviously i didn't frame that we didn't go in and figure out exactly how it's going to go together but um the general idea i think should make sense there and the fact that this volume covers up the other materials that's fine that doesn't that doesn't hurt anything uh it just gives us more space space to to kind of work in there so i'm going to go ahead and make that a group and assign that to ceiling 2 now there is one other uh one other thing we want to look at uh it's not the most popular but it does happen a lot and if you're creating an existing space you may have to mess with a drop ceiling so if i was doing a drop ceiling here's what i would do um i come in with a rectangle draw 25 4x 48 cuz that's a a standard size of a a ceiling uh drop ceiling acoustical tile um and let's see we'll give that a half inch i actually don't know how one inch i don't know i don't exactly how no that's not right either 3/4 of an inch i don't know now now i'm messing with details that don't really matter that much i'm going to take that and make it a component um i'm just going to call it my top i'm going to take that and we're going to stick it right here and then pull it down 12 in get us to that same ceiling height we have before all right now i'm going to take that piece option copy this way and then i'll say i don't know four times all right we'll grab that whole run right there take it option copy over here and then we'll go do that i don't know 12 times that nail it nope a it's close i was you're not going to believe i'm winging this if i get the guest right both directions all right so there that gives us our tiles now in some cases that might be good i might be yeah cool that's fine um but anybody who's done or dealt with this knows that there's an important piece missing and that's the track that those acoustic tiles sit in so i may want to i say may because this again is is all about level of detail what is the appropriate level of detail um and of course you're going to want to model the level of detail that makes sense for your model so i'm going to draw this little little 1 in by an eighth of an inch rectangle i'm going to extend it all the way down to the opposite wall going to grab that make that into a component actually i'm not make it a component i'm just going to make it a group i don't need to uh i got i got an issue with my clicking all right there we go right make a group i'm not going to repeat this or it's going to repeat but not there's no reason to sync them together so do that and then say 1 two 3 four five six 78 8 x that gives me half my grid the other pieces so i do need pieces around the edge so i'm going to come in here come over half an inch actually we'll say one inch this way to and then same thing i'll drop down actually you know why am i doing that let's just let's just do this take this and we'll just option copy this over here same thing on the end this is a little different because this is a full piece uh so my spacing is a little off right because this is now a half inch smaller than than one in but still works all right and then i need some going this way so same thing i'm going to start i flipped upside down here i'm going to come this way 0 five i could try to grab uh an existing piece and scale it and make it work the right right you know size and everything but for me just drawing that rectangle and push pulling it real quick is a way quicker easier way to do that i know it's a little brute force but still all right then we going to make a group there and then i'm going to say option copy this way and that is 3x and grab all of those and we're going to go here to here 8x go and then this last row i'm going to grab all of these and i'm going to scale them now i'm going to turn on x rus the inside of here and then i can go to zoom in kind of tight there it is i'm just going to pull that out to here now it's scaled the right size turn x off and now before i do anything else while it's still selected i'm just going to hit move and that's going to let me option copy that right over to this right here because these are shorter too and then the last thing i have to do is grab a row of those actually the way this would work would be i would have one more of these so let's go oops let's go vertical take this piece option rotate it this way that runs this way and then these actually what'll happen is all of these pieces if we're trying to get it right look look as right as possible without overlapping geometry i hate when geometry just slightly overlaps and causes issues so if i look down here it's exactly what i got going on see that so i'm going to hit scale i'm going to turn x-ray on again so i can see inside the wall and i'm just going to grab that middle handle pull that so it hits the face of this other whoops whoa i got kind of crazy with my zoom i apologize wouldn't make anybody sick there right and i'm just going to pull that back to having a hard time getting that there we go and with that we have our third type of ceiling which we can also grab i don't need the ceiling stuff uh make that into a new group assign that group to ceiling three and there we go with that we got a drop ceiling frame down ceiling with a lighting nook i don't know what that's actually called but a vaulted or a tray ceiling raised up ceiling there or the super simple just a face any of them work and uh here you go see how easy that quick and easy it is to actually just put one of those in there um yeah i know it's kind of when you think about it it's pretty basic modeling nothing i did there was exceptional or difficult or anything that but there is something inherently uh challenging about modeling a thing from underneath i don't know why that is maybe it's because you flip it over and it looks backwards i i don't know what it is but i maybe i'm just talking for myself too i used to struggle with modeling ceilings because it was always i had to stop and just think reverse i don't know maybe i'm making it more difficult than i have to but really it's pretty simple to model that geometry it's really a question of the right level of detail you need for the job you're doing and the right geometry and organizing um pretty simple grouping pretty pretty simple tagging and uh you can have some options in just a couple of minutes if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below uh did you that do you have to model that did i miss something is there a thing that i should have done differently or do you have an idea for a video something we've never showed before let us know down in the comments we making these videos a lot we them even more when they showing something you want to see thank you [music]
