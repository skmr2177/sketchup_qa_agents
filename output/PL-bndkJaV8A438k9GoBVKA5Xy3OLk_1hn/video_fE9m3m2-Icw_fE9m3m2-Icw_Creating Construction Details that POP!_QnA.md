##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: creating construction details that pop! video id: fe9m3m2-icw playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fe9m3m2-icw uploader: sketchup duration: 626 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:04:19.008653 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today i want to with you how to make your construction details go from flat to fab using just sketchup's native tools so we've most of us in the environmental design industry whether you're in landscape or in um architecture or even interior design you're probably going to come across construction details one way or another whether you're working with them in sketchup to build something in 3d or going the opposite so taking something from 3d and going to construction documents i want to kind of look at the difference now between going again the traditional method which is just kind of cutting a section slice or looking at something in plan view and drafting it in two dimensions something you'd see in autocad and then instead going a little bit further which is adding some depth adding some shadow and some texture and some realism and then of course you know looking at it from different angles so that we're getting one detail in a way can actually become multiple details so let's just go ahead and get to it so this is here what uh i've got it's a finished detail but i want to kind of start here for example this is a landscape planter wall and stair and again this process doesn't have to be for landscape it can be for architecture or interiors as well it just happens to be a model that i had details that i had access to and um you can see that now you know this tells us pretty much everything we need to know know but it's looking at one slice so if you were to draft this in cad you would have to do this slice for this one and then you'd have to slice it again through the wall you'd have to do a separate one for plan view and i'm just wanting to do sort of one that then i can get multiple um pieces of content out of so i'm going to pop over here to my axo so you can see the difference here between the sort of 2d and the 3d so all the same information obviously there's some text call outs that i wouldn't do in sketchup i would do those in layout and we'll do another video on that uh soon but you can see you've got all the information about what's happening with the footings i think i have something here that i had hidden so i'll just make sure that everything is of course showing and that's how easy it is just pop into that group and there it is so now this is an example of one where i had the detail and actually modeled from the detail but let's look at it let's look at sort of if we were starting from scratch so i want to take this away and i want to kind of look at at let's see here let's really quick take away that section cut so we can do that over again and let's look at for example this may be pulled from my model meaning that this could be part of a bigger model so this doesn't have to necessarily be built just as a construction detail this could be built um as part of my model and i can just grab the stair and grab the planter and the handrail and all of the things that come with it and i can just copy those either into a new file or copy it off to the side you know you may or may not want want to use the entire model and add construction details to it because you know you may want to modify it you know and you want it to be a little bit different because again construction details sort of read um a little bit different than how you might have it um before so let's pretend we're not let's pretend here for a second i'm going to go ahead and take this out there we go i don't want to jump to the next step let's pretend we are starting from scratch i grabbed the stair and the handrail and the planter from my model and i copied it into a new model first thing i might want to do is come over here to tools and section plane now you can add a section plane on the outside the problem is if you had multiple details then what it's going to do it's going to cut through everything right so as a safer bet you may want to actually go into whatever group that you want to show a section cut through and do that same thing tools section plane use the arrow keys if you want to align it you know to an axis and then there you go and what's cool about that is then what i can do is if i wanted to just cut a section through in this case the stair so i can see what's happening underneath it i can do that fairly easily um without interfering with sort of the other geometry the handrails and things that so now i've got a keyboard shortcut you can come over here and go view section planes i've got a keyboard shortcut for that just kind of allows me to toggle that on and off and then this is where you get to kind of decide here i purposefully extended these handrails um the post for the handrail a little bit lower so i kind of want to start there i'm going to let's see example i'm not going to do the whole detail i'm just going to do part of it but for example i'm hitting the modifier which is option alt and then i'm using the left arrow key to make sure that i'm aligned to the green axis that way i'm getting a rectangle that is centered here and if i want to bring that up again i'm going to just make sure to snap that there i'll push use push pull to pull that back and you could leave that you could just use a rectangle and cut this out or you could offset it you know or i could kind of do something a little bit fancier let's see if this works is come over here and use something the the um use something the circle tool and i'll show you why here because what i want to do is i want to remove this piece to show that there's some space around it but in order to do that i kind of need to pull up this arc which is a half circle and then when i delete that face maybe even take these and reverse these come over here reverse those turn the shadows off just so you can see that so if i turn my hidden geometry on you can see that i've got that arc there and it just gives a little bit more depth when you look at it straight on so if i change my camera to um if i wanted to show this almost as a traditional detail i could set the camera to parallel projection and then you can see that depending on your light settings so your shadow settings depending on where your shadows are hitting you're getting that depth that's coming in there and that's actually kind of cool i'm also using sketchup version 2024 so you can see here if i go to edit and then my faces you can see the difference that the ambient occlusion makes maybe i'll back out a little bit so you can see that now again whether you the sort of flat style um that works too and then you can add that ambient inclusion and especially works well when you switch your style to um for example hidden line style you can see that you still get that all that cool depth and stuff and i'm really liking the way that looks so let me go back let me leave all that stuff alone go back to textures make sure am inclusions on okay cool so speaking of styles and surfaces and textures so once i get this done here i can group that or make it a component depending on how i want to use this again and then inside of that i'm going to open up under not my crayons here which these are mac os a lot of people asks where these come from these come from the mac operating system so if you're on pc it looks a little bit different what i want to point out here is under patterns you get some kind of cool things that look a little bit construction details they lines and there's textures and there's just things but more on a um almost a handrawn or a cad drawn look so what i want to do is look for this one kind of here and i can apply that to the concrete so i apply that to everything within there and then that gives it kind of a concrete looking uh texture which i think let me switch my camera angle which i think looks pretty cool now depending on how you model this you can also come over here and i'm i'm going to copy this i'm going to delete it and i was kind of thinking ahead so i made this handrail um i made this a component so if i go in and place this in go up here to edit paste in place you can see that if only by uh pasting it one time and it shows up wherever this handrail shows up uh the footing will the concrete footer or footing will show up as well so now there's more to it here obviously um depending on whether you're making this up from what you know how it's going to be built or whether you're using construction detail as a reference i showed in the beginning let me go go ahead and just undo that last step because i already have all of these things in here so if i turn this on i can come over here and say unhide and for whatever reason that one stays likes to stay hidden so i'll unhide that and i will turn off that so that's again super cool i said in the beginning um you can look at it a few different ways you can look at it in a in axonometric you can look at it in elevation again i probably want to take the uh camera perspective out of that or you can look at it in this case in plan view and then you just turn that section off and then depending on how you've set up your file in this case i have 2d plants and i have 3d plants um 2d as an assemble and 3d as in a face me it's not actually 3d it's they're both 2d you get what i'm saying it's kind of cool cu then i can look at this in plan view and i can look at this again i can look at styling it and then when i'm ready i can send this off to layout and add my annotations i wouldn't do that here so that's it you can see here if i move this around whether you are cutting a section through it whether you're showing the footer whether you're adding plants and details and notes and things that it's really up to you on how much information you want to show the cool thing about this again i said in the beginning is that once you get it into 3d you can choose after the fact how many different views you think you need to explain how this particular planter needs to be built or can be built and i just love the idea of having options as always and choice and control so if i just cut that one section and then i find myself contractor ask questions later you know this really helps kind of just add that extra level of detail and polish and dimension to your construction details so i'm i'm going to let you go there i'm going to say thanks as always for watching let us know what you think in the comments below uh have you used this method have you tried it are you worried about it does it is there something do you just cad it's okay we can um i won't tell anyone so let us know in the comments and we will see you next time [music]
