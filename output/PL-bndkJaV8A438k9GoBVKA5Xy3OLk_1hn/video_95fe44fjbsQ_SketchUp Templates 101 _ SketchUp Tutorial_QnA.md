## Q&A Pairs

### 1. What is the main purpose of SketchUp templates according to Aaron?

**A:** Aaron explains that SketchUp templates are **preset starting points** that save you from repetitive setup work. He emphasizes that templates can contain much more than just basic geometry - they can include components, styles, scenes, tags, environments, and settings that you use repeatedly. Aaron notes that many people "do the same stuff over and over again" when starting new models, and templates eliminate this repetitive work by allowing you to "change that once and save as a template."

### 2. What specific elements does Aaron explain are included in a SketchUp template?

**A:** Aaron details several key elements that make up a template: **components in the model** (like scale figures), **screen display settings** (axes on/off, camera type), **tags/layers** that you use repeatedly, **styles** (edges, profiles, materials, ambient occlusion, backgrounds, watermarks), **scenes** (front-facing, top view, side views), **environments** (new to SketchUp 2025), **components in the browser** (furniture, cars, set dressing), **fog and shadow settings**, and **model info settings** (units, dimensions, text preferences). Aaron emphasizes that all these elements are saved and will appear automatically in new files created from the template.

### 3. How does Aaron demonstrate the importance of scale figures in templates?

**A:** Aaron explains that scale figures like TomTom serve a crucial purpose beyond just showing "we are people." He demonstrates that without a human-sized reference, it's impossible to tell the scale of your model - a simple rectangle could be "the size of a wood block like a child's toy" or "could I fit a car inside here." Aaron notes that each SketchUp release has a different figure (TomTom is the 2025 figure), and these provide immediate visual scale reference so you can tell if something is "probably like a couple feet tall because TomTom's a human size person."

### 4. What specific style settings does Aaron configure in his custom template?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates several style customizations: **turning off profiles** to get default line length everywhere, **keeping all lines black**, **setting materials to "faster transparency rather than nicer"** (his preference over multiple levels), **turning on ambient occlusion** (which he mentions he likes and talks about a lot), **turning on the ground** with a gray color (replacing the "offending" green), **turning off "show ground from below"**, and **turning off sky** because he plans to use an environment instead. Aaron shows that these preferences can be saved once and reused in every new model.

### 5. How does Aaron demonstrate setting up environments in his template?

**A:** Aaron shows the new SketchUp 2025 environments feature by selecting "At Sea" environment and configuring it with **reflections enabled**, **skydome enabled**, and **midday lighting** to give shadows from above. He notes that environments are "new to SketchUp 2025" and can be set up once in a template to appear automatically in new files. Aaron demonstrates that environments replace the need for sky settings and provide more realistic lighting and reflection options.

### 6. What does Aaron explain about including components in templates?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates adding a wine glass component to his template and explains that **any components you drag into the template will be available in the component browser** for new files. He notes that components don't have to be visible in the model - they can just be saved in the component browser. However, Aaron warns that **adding many components can "weigh down an empty template"** because SketchUp has to load all components even if they're not visible, which can slow down file opening. He recommends being selective about which components to include.

### 7. How does Aaron demonstrate creating and organizing tags in his template?

**A:** Aaron shows creating three specific tags: **"ref" for reference layer** (which he uses a lot), **"main" for main content**, and **"existing" for existing/remodel work**. He explains that if you "use the same tags repeatedly" for similar work (like designing houses), you can set them up in your template and they'll show up automatically populated. Aaron warns that **empty tags will be removed if you purge**, so you need to be conscious of this when setting up template tags.

### 8. What is the process Aaron demonstrates for saving a template?

**A:** Aaron shows the complete template saving process: **File > Save as Template**, which prompts for a template name (he names it "Aaron template"), and offers the option to **set it as the default template**. He demonstrates that after saving, a new untitled file opens with the template applied. Aaron explains that templates are just SketchUp files saved in a specific location, and any SketchUp file can become a template by being placed in the templates folder.

### 9. How does Aaron explain the difference between default and custom templates?

**A:** Aaron shows that **default templates are hardcoded and cannot be messed up** - they're protected. Custom templates are just regular SketchUp files in a specific folder. He demonstrates using **File > New** (uses default template) versus **File > New from Template** (lets you choose any template). Aaron shows the heart icon that indicates the default template, noting "only one of these can have my heart" and that's the template that appears when you just hit "new."

### 10. What specific workflow tips does Aaron share about templates?

**A:** Aaron emphasizes that if you "go in and start clicking and changing stuff" when you start a new model, you should consider making those changes once and saving as a template. He notes that many people "get rid of the scale figure and then they go do this and they do this and they do the same stuff over and over again" - templates eliminate this repetitive work. Aaron recommends looking at your workflow and identifying repetitive tasks that could be templated to "save yourself steps next time you model."

### 11. How does Aaron demonstrate the relationship between templates and file size?

**A:** Aaron explains that while most template elements (styles, tags, scenes) don't significantly affect file size, **components do impact the template weight**. He notes that if you put 70 components in a template, every new file will have to load all those components even if they're not visible, which can slow down file opening. Aaron demonstrates this by adding a wine glass component and showing it appears in the component browser of new files, but warns against overloading templates with unnecessary components.

### 12. What does Aaron explain about template file locations and management?

**A:** Aaron shows that template locations are found in **Settings > Files**, where you can see the templates folder path. He explains that **any SketchUp file placed in this folder becomes a potential template** - there's no special file format required. Aaron emphasizes that templates are "just SketchUp files in a folder" and SketchUp recognizes them as templates. He notes that unlike Microsoft Word templates (which have special formats), SketchUp templates are just regular .skp files in a specific location.

### 13. How does Aaron demonstrate the difference between model info and application settings?

**A:** Aaron explains that **application settings** (found in Settings) apply to all of SketchUp regardless of template, while **model info settings** (units, dimensions, text preferences) are saved with the template. He shows that model info settings like preferred units, dimension appearance, and text settings will be saved into the template and appear in new files. Aaron demonstrates that this distinction is important for understanding what gets saved with templates versus what applies globally to SketchUp.

### 14. What does Aaron recommend about fog and shadow settings in templates?

**A:** Aaron shows that **fog and shadow settings can be enabled and saved in templates**. He explains that he doesn't use fog often (only for very large models to fade out the back), and while he likes shadows, he doesn't love "the toll they take on my modeling process" for complicated models. Aaron demonstrates turning off both fog and shadows in his template, noting that these settings can be configured once and reused rather than being set up repeatedly for each new model.

### 15. How does Aaron demonstrate the component scaling issue in templates?

**A:** Aaron shows that when he adds a wine glass component to his template, it appears "big" in new files because he "didn't rescale it before" saving the template. He notes that components maintain their size and properties when saved in templates, so you should adjust components to the desired size before saving the template. Aaron demonstrates that the wine glass appears in the component browser of new files "ready to use" but at the size it was when saved in the template.

### 16. What does Aaron explain about the relationship between templates and scenes?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates that **scenes can be saved in templates** and are particularly useful for repeated workflows. He shows that if you "do the same views over and over again" (like front-facing, top view, side scenes), you can add them to your template and they'll appear automatically. Aaron explains that you can also add sections and key them to scenes, saving significant time for users who work with similar view setups repeatedly.

### 17. How does Aaron demonstrate the template selection interface?

**A:** Aaron shows the template selection dialog that appears when using **File > New from Template**. He demonstrates the different categories: **default templates** (like "Simple") and **custom templates** (like his "Aaron template"). Aaron shows the heart icon that indicates the default template and explains that clicking the heart changes which template appears when you just hit "new." He demonstrates switching between different templates and shows how the interface organizes template options.

### 18. What does Aaron recommend about template naming and organization?

**A:** Aaron names his template "Aaron template because Aaron made this template" and explains that template names should be descriptive and indicate who created them or what they're for. He shows that templates appear in the selection dialog with their names, so clear naming helps identify which template to use. Aaron demonstrates that you can have multiple custom templates and choose between them based on your current project needs.

### 19. How does Aaron explain the relationship between templates and the component browser?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates that **components added to a template appear in the component browser** of new files created from that template. He shows that even if components aren't visible in the template model, they're still available for use in new files. Aaron explains that this is useful for frequently used components like "2D scale figures, face me trees, furniture, cars, whatever set dressing you use the same one all the time."

### 20. What does Aaron demonstrate about template customization workflow?

**A:** Aaron shows a complete template customization workflow: **changing the scale figure** (replacing TomTom), **modifying styles** (turning off profiles, changing colors), **adding environments** (At Sea with reflections), **including components** (wine glass), **creating tags** (ref, main, existing), and **saving the template**. He demonstrates that each customization is done once and then saved, eliminating the need to repeat these steps for every new model.

### 21. How does Aaron explain the difference between template components and model components?

**A:** Aaron demonstrates that **components in the template model** (like the wine glass he adds) will appear in new files, while **components in the component browser** are available for use but not automatically placed. He shows that dragging components into the template makes them part of the template file, and they'll appear in new files created from that template. Aaron notes that this distinction is important for understanding what gets included in template files.

### 22. What does Aaron recommend about template file management?

**A:** Aaron explains that **templates are just SketchUp files** and can be managed like any other file. He shows that you can place any SketchUp file in the templates folder to make it available as a template. Aaron emphasizes that there's nothing "magical" about templates - they're just files in a specific location that SketchUp recognizes as template options. He notes that this makes template management simple and flexible.

### 23. How does Aaron demonstrate the template preview and selection process?

**A:** Aaron shows that when you use **File > New from Template**, SketchUp displays a dialog with all available templates organized by category. He demonstrates selecting different templates and shows how the interface displays template options. Aaron explains that the heart icon indicates the default template, and clicking different hearts changes which template is used for regular "new" commands. He shows how this interface makes template selection intuitive and organized.

### 24. What does Aaron explain about template file locations on different operating systems?

**A:** Aaron notes that he's on Mac but mentions that the template functionality works the same on Windows. He shows that template locations are found in the **Settings > Files** menu, where you can see the exact folder path where templates are stored. Aaron explains that this location may look different on Windows versus Mac, but the functionality is identical - any SketchUp file in the templates folder becomes available as a template option.

### 25. What does Aaron conclude about the benefits of using templates?

**A:** Aaron concludes that templates are "another one of those things where people get concerned with or worried with poking at or changing or messing with" but emphasizes that they're actually simple and safe to use. He notes that you "can't mess up the default templates" since they're hardcoded, and custom templates are just regular SketchUp files. Aaron strongly recommends examining your workflow to identify repetitive tasks that could be templated, noting that templates can save significant time and eliminate repetitive setup work for users who "do the same stuff over and over again."
