##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

what does that mean when you say a template? what is that? i mean, obviously it's a preset of some sort, but what all is included in a sketchup template? that's the first thing we're going to touch on. then we're going to talk about how to set it up, how to save it, and how to choose if it's your default or just one of the templates you choose from. let's hop in. all right. so, i'm right now i'm with the the first default basic, i think it's called, something that. but, uh, it's got tomtom here, gray floor. i just, you know, that sky blue background with the axis right in the front. uh, this is the simplest template. there's really nothing much going on here. uh but a template can be used for so much. i can put so much stuff in here. so i want to talk a little bit about what it is that makes up a template uh before we go any further. so first thing is what's in the model when you start. most templates have this scale figure. if it's if it's a default template from sketchup, it is the years each each release each annual release has a different figure here. so it's that that year's figure. so this is sketchup 225. so we have tomtom here. uh that component's in here. it's a face me component just a little ways from the axis. uh yeah, pretty simple, pretty cool. that's easy. we do put this in here on purpose. it's not just to brag that we are people. um it is to have a humsized thing. otherwise, i come in here, right, and i draw a rectangle and i push pull this up. how big is this? is this the size of a wood block a child's toy? is this, you know, could i fit a car inside here? if i'm just zoomed in this, i really have no idea unless i start checking lengths and sides. if i look at it here, i can go, okay, so it's probably a couple feet tall because tomtom's a human size person. um, all right. so, that's the one thing. what's going on on the screen? and not just not just what components are in here on the screen, but also things do i want my axes on? do i want to turn my axes on or off? um, what what camera do i want to save in my my default parallel or perspective? all of that is part of the template. additionally, if we come over to, and i'm i'm on mac, so i'm going to show you the mac wind windows here, but this is the same stuff that's in the tab bar on a windows machine. um, tags. if you have tags created and you save a template, that template will show up with tags. so, this is really cool. if you do, you know, similar work day after day, you're design houses again and again and again, you do landscape, you do whatever it is you do, if you use the same tags repeatedly, you can set them up in your template, save that template, and they will show up automatically populated. now, you do have to be careful because if you purge, you can get rid of empty tags. so, you do have to be conscious of the fact that empty content will get thrown away if you purge. so if i if you save this and then the first thing you do is you purge, it's going to wipe all those out. but if you want to populate tags, you can do that and they'll show up in there. likewise, styles. so in here, this is the default style, right? so i got this this style here. and i could go through here and see, okay, i got edges and profiles. all my lines are the same colors. uh my materials, ambient occlusion, what's the background , watermarks, uh my selection and section information. all of this is also saved into this template. so if you find yourself repeatedly every time i come in here, i come in here and i set my section line width back to one and change away from the gray fill to a blue fill. what whatever it is, you don't doing that every time. do it once. save it into your template and then when you come in, you won't have to do it again. likewise, keep moving down here. scenes. scenes can also be saved. this is really cool because if you do again if you do repeated types of things, if i want to always have, you know, this front-facing scene, top face and from the side scene, top view, um, if i do the same views over and over again, you can add them. you can add sections and save them in here too and then key those sections to scenes. all that can be set up and saved over and over saved and then used over and over again. uh, big time saver. i so many people i talk to first thing they do is they come in and they they get rid of the scale figure and then they go do this and they do this and they do the same stuff over and over again. they can save themselves so much time by changing that once and saving as a scene. so we'll come we're going to come back here and actually do this but i want to just run through the things real quick. uh new to sketch 2025 is of course environments. so you can see right now we have no environment in this default scene. so, if i wanted to come in and say always start with the same environment and then choose how does that actually get applied, i could set all of that up right here one time, save it, and then always show up that same way. um, uh, the other thing is components, right? components. if you have components that you use repeatedly, so i always drop in the same 2d scale figures in all my drawings. i use the same face me trees. i use the same whatever it is the same furniture cars whatever set dressing you use the same one all the time you load it in every time you can save it in here not even it doesn't have to be in your model you can just save it in as a component and it will be here in the component browser ready for your drag in now point of clarification the rest of these uh aren't going to affect the file size so much once you start adding components it is going to save that file into your template so, opening starting a new file if it's got, you know, if i put 70 components in here sounds great because i have everything right here ready for me. the problem is every time you open the model, even though they're not on the screen, if they're saved in here as components, it has to go through and open all those up, make sure they're all there. so, this can can weigh down an empty template by saving a bunch of stuff in here. so, just something to be note to note there. um, last couple things. fogs. fogs. i've never pluralized fog before, but i guess it would be fogs. fog settings, maybe that's where i was going. fog setting and shadow settings can also be enabled and uh set. so, you can actually come in here and choose how do i want those to go and they'll be saved also. so, if you always build in the same location in a certain time of day to show your model, you can set that all up and save that in there. um some other things of course if we do come up here go into settings this stuff is going to be saved in here too. uh actually this is this is mostly uh sketchup stuff. so i'm just looking nope. all of this all of this is saved regardless. so these are all settings that apply to all of sketchup no matter what template you use. over here in window. however, when we go into model info, this information is going to be saved into the model. so, if you have a preferred unit of measurement or you want your dimensions to appear a certain way or your text, you can set all of this first and then save that. that will get saved into your template as well. all right. so, having said all that, let's make a template that's different from the default. um, all right. i love tomtom, but let's uh let's change this up so it's immediately noticeable as a different file. i'm going to drop a new face me in here, and we're going to stick that in. and this is just going to immediately tell me, oh, yeah, this is this is the good stuff. all right, so different face me character in here. that's awesome. um, let's change some background stuff, too. so, i'm going to come in here to scenes. nope, not scene styles. uh, let's go. so, i'm just going to edit the default. i'm going to turn off my profiles, so i just get the default length everywhere. i'm going to leave it all as black. uh, i all the default materials, faster transparency rather than nicer. i prefer that. some people really that multiple levels to see through, but i think this is that faster is fine. i am going to turn on ambient occlusion because i it. you watch the videos, you know, i it and i talk about a lot. all right. over here, um, i do want to turn on the ground. uh, that green color is offending me. all right, let's go grab uh brown or no, let's just go with a gray. let's just keep gray. okay, the silver. that sound that looks nice. uh, i'm going to turn off show ground from below. i'm also going to turn off sky because i don't want to see the sky because the next thing i'm going to do is pop down to environments and uh choose an environment i . um, kind of that one. that's that's nice. i don't know if i've used that one. the highlands. um, we say edit. yes, i want to use it for reflections. yes, i want to use it for skydoome. um, and then i can if i want to change this exposure, how how how that affects or interacts. that's i can change that. but, you know what? highs is boring. let's go. uh, that's better. i want to get some sky in there at sea. now, i'm just being midday. that's going to give me a shadow from above. that looks cool. i that. uh, okay. so, i got that in there. um, let's say i have uh i'm going to get rid of the components that i don't actually use. so, i'm get rid of those and i'll just keep this one in here. um, if there's some other stuff i wanted, right, if i wanted more than just a person in here, i wanted uh, you know, a little little table or something that. and then maybe i'll drop in a prop that i . i'll put this wine glass in here. that's a big wine glass. i should probably shrink that down a little bit. all right. so, if i if i had something this where maybe i was doing a series of models for a bar or something that where i want to start with something. i don't know. i'm making stuff up. but i can bring that stuff in here and then i can actually have it as part of the model. so, if i save my template right now, when i start up a new model, this would be . this would be this box. this would be the wine glass would show up. if i just wanted the scale figure, i could get rid of this. and you notice because i pulled it in, the wine glass is still part of the model. so, anything i drag in here, it's going to already be here. so, when i start this, i can just grab it, drop it in, and i'm set. um, additionally, i said, here's the other stuff i could come in and add. i could say i always want to keep a fog on. i don't i don't use fog very often. if i'm doing something real big, i want to fade out the back. i'll use fog. but as a default, i don't that. same with shadows. i shadows, but uh i don't love the toll they take on my modeling process. uh it's a little too much work to do shadows once you get a complicated model. so, i'm going to turn that off, too. and then just uh let's let's go ahead and add a couple of tags. so, i'm just going to hit plus and i'm going to say um i don't i'm just going to or no, here's one i use a lot. i use a reference layer. ref. so, i usually put that in. uh, and then we'll put in another one here that is uh main and then maybe we'll do a remodel or existing. we'll put a tag in there called existing. uh, there we go. so, we got a couple of tags in there. um, i could save that in. i could get the look that i . where where do i want this to be? once i've got all that put in, it's all set up the way i want. i go to file and i hit save as template. when i click save as template, it's gonna say, "what do you want to call this?" and i'm just going to call this um template because made this template. that's why it's called that. all right. so, we have an option here to set it as the default template. if we go ahead and hit save right now, stuff's going to flash. and then this actually popped open on my second monitor. here is a brand new untitled thing with that template. so if i close this, i say file, new because the default template, that new, it keeps coming to my other screen. that new window is always going to look this. if i say file, new from template, it's going to pop up and say, okay, which one of these templates do you want? so here's all my default ones. right? this is the simple that we were working from before. but over here in my templates, i have all the templates i've created before. you see this little heart here? this is the default. only one of these can have my heart. my heart only goes to one template. um, that is the one that's going to show up if you just hit new. so, if i was to come back over here and say, okay, architectural is actually my favorite. then when i just say file, new, it's going to pull up on the other screen, of course, that default architectural template. so if i go back into new from template, hop back over here, this is the one i want to see when i start new file, new. boom. my other screen, of course. there we go. and again, because it's part of the template, if i come over here to tags, i will see, okay, here's my empty tags. that's awesome. if i go to components. oh, here's my wine glass even though i haven't it's still big because i i didn't rescale it before i yeah. um, but that's still part of it, right? that's still part of my template. so, it shows up in there and is ready to use. so, maybe a wine glass isn't the perfect thing to add in there. but, i said, if you put cars or 2d people into all your models, that sort of thing, you can do that and then have them just show up automatically. but that's it. that is how easy templates are. the other thing to mention is that templates are just sketchup files. there's nothing magical about them. they are they're sketchup files that are saved into a specific location. that location is in your settings menu. and if we go to our our paths, we can see hold on. i i can't talk and uh look at the same time. so uh here's a list of our templates, but if we go to files, we can actually see where our templates are stored right here. so any files that are dumped into here become potential templates. so it can be literally anything. any sketchup file you have can be saved into this folder. it will show up as a potential template and can be chos. so there we go. uh templates are a funny thing because they they're another one of those things where people get concerned with or worried with poking at or changing or messing with. you can't so you can't mess up the default templates, right? those default templates are saved. they're hardcoded. you can't mess up a template that comes shipped with sketchup. uh, as far as creating your own, i said, it's just a sketchup file. people think there's and i i know in some things microsoft word, there was a special file format for templates and there was something different set apart. it's just a sketchup file. it's a sketchup file in a folder. sketchup recognize it as something. that's it. that's all there is to it. so, i highly recommend if you look at look at your workflow when you start a new model, do you go in and start clicking and changing stuff? if so, you should consider making those changes, saving as a template, and saving yourself steps next time you model. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week, and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly, though, please leave us a down below. did i miss anything with templates? do you have a way of using templates that i didn't touch on? do you have questions specific to templates or do you have an idea for a new video? something we haven't done before, something we need to go deeper on, let us know down in the comments. we making these videos a lot. we them even more when showing something you want to see. thank you.
