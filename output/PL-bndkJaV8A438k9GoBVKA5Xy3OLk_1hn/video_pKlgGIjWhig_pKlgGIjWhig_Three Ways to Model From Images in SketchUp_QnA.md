##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: three ways to model from images in sketchup video id: pklggijwhig playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pklggijwhig uploader: sketchup duration: 641 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:09:09.957429 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today i want to with you how to create a sweet looking existing conditions model kind of this building here behind me using just free images found online so when i say free images found online i mean that sometimes we need uh to build a building uh especially if we want to show a context building or something that exists in the real world and uh we don't really have cad floor plans we don't have ads built drawings we just have an image of it so question is is how can we model from just an image and not only that but how can we use more than one image where do we get them how do we import them into sketchup let's go ahead and cover that process now now i will say right now this is just an overview of the process because i'm going to plug a campus course that we've done that shows the entire process so right now i just want to kind of show you what are the three image sources that i can use to build a model this this is an existing building in portland oregon h it used to be a trimble office so i thought this would be really cool to see if we could build this and maybe do a redesign adaptive reuse who knows so the first thing i want to just kind of point out and this sounds obvious but you know i to start with the footprint so in order to do that i need to go to plan view so when we go to plan view then when i say reference image i think it should be obvious but maybe not that i'm referring to this aerial image so there's different sources that you can get especially depending on version of sketchup you're using but for me if i hide this and pretend we're starting from the beginning this aerial image is really important because it kind of tells me some things it tells me where the sidewalk is tells me maybe where the cars or where this ramp is you know where maybe the existing trees are there's a lot of information that can be gathered just from the aerial so we have other videos on geolocation so i won't spend a lot of time but i will point out one cool feature i'm going to go ahead and say add more imagery because i've already kind of geolocated this model you can switch between a satellite photo or a street map so the difference between the two is that the satellite gives you more information i think as far as the context around the building so the sidewalk maybe some cars an air conditioning unit some of those details that i think are going to be important to bring this existing space to life in 3d but the street map gives you some information that you don't get maybe necessarily or gives it to you in a different way for example le you get the building footprint you get maybe a parcel line you get kind of you can estimate better where the street center lines are so what i'm going to do is grab uh since i already have the aerial i'm going to grab just this regular map so you can do both you can go back and forth and grab both the satellite and the street map so i'm going to hide this for a second um what i want to do is pretend i'm starting from scratch you can see here that if i was going to start from scratch this makes it a little bit easier to see compared to the aerial where my building footprint lines or edges are going to be now the aerial itself is taken it's a taken from remember the roof down so depending on how tall the building what you see as the roof may not be what's actually touching the ground so i do get my building footprints from this sort of non- aial more diagrammatic map view and then once i've done that let me go ahead and get rid of this don't need it that was just for reference once i've done that then i can go in and extrude my building and then start to populate out the pieces around it so that first piece of information here is going to be both the aerial and the street map that you can get from geolocation and if you don't use geolocation or you don't have access to it you can always bring in an aerial from a different place or you can bring in something from near map or placemaker there's other sources that you can get aerial information from beyond the geolocation feature so definitely start that process there so now once we've got sort of that footprint here and we just maybe bring it up and we're ready to kind of start the 3d part the 2d to 3d part so what information can we work with here so this is where going down to street level in something google maps or bing maps or apple maps and grabbing a street level view that you can then bring in to model from in this case i'm going to start with match photo so match photo is a feature here so when you import into sketchup you can go import it's going to give you the option to use it as an image use it as a texture or this third option which is use use as matched photo so if you select use as matched photo what you get is sort of an interesting way that it brings the image in not as a watermark not as a texture but as sort of an overlay so you can see when i zoom out here what it's doing is it's fixing it's locking that image into perspective and then i can go in and align my models perspective if i come over here and open up my matched photo panel you can see here is that it gives you some settings that i can then go in and turn the grid on and off i can adjust these grid lines so i can basically match the model to the photo now i'm not going to go into too much detail on how to do that because we've got tons of great videos actually already existing that go into way more detail about how to get the perfect match photo in this case the point is is that you can bring an image in you can use it as a match photo and for example i'll give you an example why this is really helpful if i was to go in and place uh my utility poles you can see it's ma it's matching the perspective um it's locking the perspective of the photo so that when i go to place it i can just kind of place that right where i want it and i know that's going to be u pretty close to what it is in real life so that's really helpful for me so i'm going back and forth between my modeling view you know if i rotate i lose that match photo perspective i'm out of it and i can go back to that match photo i can bring that back in anytime so that was two that was two ways the plan view the street view as matched photo the third way that i to do is now match photo is great but not every angle works for match photo especially if you're doing an elevation where the perspective you don't get that two-point perspective as well so i to think about it as a watermark as well for those that uh have seen my videos before you know that i love working with the watermark feature the watermark you can see when i zoom out here let me just go and toggle that section cut off when i zoom out unlike that matched photo it didn't zoom out with my model it stayed fixed and that's because this image is not being referenced in the model it's not being referenced in the match photo setting it's actually being referenced as a style so under the style under whichever style i'm have that watermark for you can see if i go to edit under watermarks i can turn the water off and on i can change the watermark from above the model i can switch it back to below the model so i can switch it you know the order of where i want it to show up and i can also go in and select the watermark and edit its transparency or or opacity settings so let me see probably better if i do that above the model where it was in the beginning and then come over here and i'll just change that so if i want to see more of the image i can see that but of course the line work gets hard to see so in this case i'm going to push that image back where i can still see it as a reference but um it's not super bright or super bold because the point is it's not for me to keep this image it's really just to model for so click okay and let me go back to that scene now i from this point on it's basically just moving the model and maybe zooming in and out and using the pan and zoom tool to sort of align this it's a little bit different method than if you've used the match photo before and again it's not going to be perfect and that's okay it's just a reference that i want to use to work so i know if i kind of look closely here i know that there's a tree well here i know there's a tree right here i can see that in the photo and and it gives me kind of a pretty close approximation on how to start so that's pretty cool so if i switch to my working view i can pop out at any point so i can switch kind of back and forth between the watermark view um and then i can switch to the working view and that pops the watermark out and i can kind of see how this building is coming together or if i'm in the match photo view and i start i start using that as my reference to kind of align things and i switch back to that working view and as soon as i um orbit i lose that m photo and i get to actually start working on my model so i'm going to go ahead and pause here i'm going to wrap up to say that i built this entire building i mean it's not 100% accurate but it's pretty close and this was built using just those three images or used actually three images in three different ways so what i want to do is i said in the beginning is that i'm going to go pretty quick because the point of this was actually to plug a course on sketchup campus so our latest course that we've launched here as of the day of this recording is architecture building from reference so this process that i use to bring in these three images and trace and draw from and reference it's all here for you step by step through a much slower pace where you actually can download the files and you can along with us and you can go ahead and practice each one of these techniques whether it's the match photo method the watermark method or the geolocation method and then of course we go beyond that where we go to 3d warehouse and we look at some other details that don't show up in the images and just kind of how to basically approach a process this where you're modeling from just images so that was it that was basically three images brought into sketchup three different ways and basically just using what i see in the images to model a building um that then i can use in my r renderings or i could use in a concept design or i could send off to um you know another team and then you can start doing some test fit exercises so whatever you the use is for something this this technique obviously that's up to you but hopefully you found uh something in here useful uh take that campus course let us know there's a ch place to give feedback there as well so if you've taken it already let us know how it went if not go check it out at learn. sketchup.com and i will leave you there with thank you and see you next time [music]
