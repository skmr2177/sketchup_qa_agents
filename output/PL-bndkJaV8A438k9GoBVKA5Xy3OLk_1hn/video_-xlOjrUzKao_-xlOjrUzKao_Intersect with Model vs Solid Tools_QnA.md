Here are the Q&A pairs based on the transcript:

**Q:** How does SketchUp's Intersect with Model tool work?
**A:** The Intersect with Model tool is used to extrude a curved profile along a circular path to create crown molding. The process involves selecting the path first, then clicking on the profile. Inside the mug group, right-click on the surface and say "Intersect faces with model" to create edges.

**Q:** What are the differences between using Intersect with Model and Solid Tools in SketchUp?
**A:** Using Intersect with Model is a method available in any version of SketchUp, whereas Solid Tools are part of the Pro version. The solid tools can get you there faster and simplify the process, but sometimes one method works better than another.

**Q:** How do I scale down the result after using Intersect with Model?
**A:** To scale down the result, click on the "Scale" tool in the toolbar and adjust the factor to 0.1, which will return it to its original size.

**Q:** What is a keyboard shortcut for hiding the rest of the model in SketchUp?
**A:** The keyboard shortcut for hiding the rest of the model is Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows) or Command+Shift+F (Mac).

**Q:** How do I select and paste the copied edges after using Intersect with Model?
**A:** To copy the edges, press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac), then expose the rest of the model by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F (Windows) or Command+Shift+F (Mac). Then, move to the handle part, select both groups, right-click "Explode", and paste in place using Ctrl+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac).

**Q:** What is a solid group in SketchUp?
**A:** A solid group is created when you triple-click on an object and make it a group. This creates a single object that cannot be broken down into individual parts.

**Q:** How do I create an outer shell using Solid Tools in SketchUp?
**A:** To create an outer shell, select both solid groups, then go to the "Solid Tools" menu and choose "Trim" to remove intersecting parts.
