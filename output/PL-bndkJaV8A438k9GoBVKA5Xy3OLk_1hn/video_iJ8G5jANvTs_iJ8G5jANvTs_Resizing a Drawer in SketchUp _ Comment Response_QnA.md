##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- uh i got called out by you on youtube about this drawer and i got to respond okay so maybe called out is a little bit extreme uh but we did have some comments and uh some questions and some thoughts on how to do the drawer different which is exactly what i asked for at the end of every video so really there's nothing controversial about this but uh that image of me looking unhappy will probably be on the thumbnail i don't make the thumbnails but we'll see what happens anyhow uh i had a couple things come up questions about making the drawer one thing was called that i did something incorrectly and i'm going to address that absolutely another was a different way to possibly make part of the drawer we can check check on that and then another question about actually editing the drawer we changed the size of it how would that work so we're going to look at that stuff right now all right so this is the file that i have this is the actual drawer uh that i created in that last live mod or uh video um first things first one of the things that was mentioned was that i did the dovetails backwards not in that the dovetails were done incorrectly these should be these should work just fine but the direction of the doveet tails going the wrong way that that meaning this piece right here and this piece right here should be the front and back and these should be the sides idea being that if this this whole thing was pulled by the drawer front the tension would go into you know where the dovetail strong is rather than right now it's going to kind of pull it out so let's take a look at doing that real quick um this is easy and and i absolutely i i went in i just started drawing i didn't think about how these what direction these were facing whatsoever so yeah this was not this was not correct i i fully own that one um so what i want to do is i'm going to take these five pieces spin them around and then resize everything so it matches the same size of the drawer so what i'm going to do is real quick i'm going to make a new group that's just that just the outside uh here i'm going to raise it up just ever so slightly so you can see all this is is a rectangle that's tracing the top of this drawer and i could go in and note and write down the dimensions on both sides also but this is easier for me for my brain just making a quick group that is reference geometry is going to be easier than uh trying to go through and um remember what each side of the drawer dimension is and then i'm just going to take these pieces and pull them over this i will start by spinning at 90¬∞ and now when i look at these individual pieces so see these two are solid groups these are groups i didn't make these into components so it would have been a whole lot easier to do the work i'm about to do if i made these in components so we're going to make them into components to do that i'm just going to delete two of them i'm going to grab this one and i'm going to make a component and i'm just going to call this side a grab this one make it a component and call it side b this is not one of the things that anybody mentioned or said anything about uh i just wanted to point this out because this is going to make it easier to edit it one of the questions was how hard is it to change the size of stuff afterwards and that's that's what we'll look at and this is going to make that easier as well so i can take this piece and put it right back where it was by just option mirroring right there grab this one too same thing option or modifier key mirror different on windows than it is on uh mac of course all right so that looks pretty good so first thing i'm do is i'm going to grab all of this and i'm going to slide it over this way till it hits that piece then i'm going to take this piece right here and i'm going to slide it over just use a move till it goes there and now i can grab this piece right here and i'm going use scale there's a couple ways i could do this but i'm going use scale grab that middle handle and pull that till it slots right back into the middle of my slot there all right so far so good now what i have to do is i have to come into this piece grab this right here and just pull pull it out to here all right so with that we've made a square drawer so if if that was what we wanted to do we'd be done butt that right back up against that face all right but it's not of course because because life's never that simple i'll just be honest with you all right so let's here's what we got to do here i'm going to grab all of this and i'm going to move it from the final edge i'm going to pull that back and just have that go to that right there click out of here grab this one move it straight back that and then final piece right here so i saying there's a couple ways i do how to use scale last time this time i'll actually go into the entity or go into the the group push pull and just drag that right back to here with that we have now changed direction of those doveet tails so pretty quick not not a difficult process and the same thing goes here for let's let's make a couple copies of this oh i just noticed i didn't never group that face oh man who was watching me wow somebody somebody should be paying better attention to what i'm doing all right so i want to do a couple different uh versions here so one i want to say is how wide is how wide is this drawer right now this drawer is 1 foot 6 and 3/4 so i'm going to say we have one that is 9 in wide so so maybe it's a a smaller piece um up above whatever i don't know uh so what i'm going to do is i'm going to take this piece and this piece is going to slide over this way 9 in that's where i want it that's the final width of the drawer that i want so i could do a couple things here so this piece just we did before i could pull this back in hit it into the slot we'll do that that simple the other piece means taking these two and pulling them over just we did before but if i do that right now right if i come in here right now grab this just i did before slide it back look what happens great that looks good but if i look at all my other pieces oops that's not going to work so what i'm going to do before i move anything is i'm going to select both of these and hit make unique now when i hit make unique and two items are selected i knew have have a new instance now that is these two what that means if i grab this and slide this back see the other one comes along with it so these two are unique together if that makes sense they're unique at the same time which i defies the the meaning of unique i know but you know that's what it does so if you have multiple selected it'll make a new instance of those selected copies all right to get this bottom in here i'm just going to right click and just do a quick hide and then i can do the same thing i did before i can select right here scale i working with extruded rectangular shapes because you can scale everything everything is scalable i can't do that um so i'm just going to say edit unhide last and that's going to bring it back i can't do that with this piece if i grab this piece and i hit scale and i pull it out i can't just pull this out cuz look look at watch my doveet tail down here on this end see how it stretches i can't do that unless it's just a pure rectangle this and that's why that it's it's just so easy to do that all right so last thing i have to do of course is pull the face over on this drawer so um again my shortcut for this is just going to be to check okay it's a half inch so what i'll do is i'll just come over here and draw a half inch line then i'll grab again i can't i can't scale this i got to go into context grab all the geometry that makes up the end and then pull it back this way until i hit that line that i put in as reference i can click out erase that line and there we go so now i have a drawer that's half the size well let's say hold on you say but wait what is if the width is right but i need it to be shorter so right now we got a drawer that's this is 5 in what if it's supposed to be a 3-in tall drawer well let's do that so i'm going to do this a different direction i'm going to go right here first and i'm going to grab that and i'm going to drop that down 2 inch all right so that's my new front maybe this is the top drawer in a dresser or something that now as far as this goes so i said because this is not a simple rectangle angle it's not quite as easy as going all right i'll just grab this top geometry and then drop it down 2 in you can see that's not going to work that's going to make a mess so what i'm probably going to have to do in this case is go in and chop it off two inches down instead now same thing happens here 1 2 3 4 all need to be made unique so that's not now four new unique pieces that's two unique pieces two copies of each so i'm going to come into this one right here i'm going to come here i'm going see where 2 in is oh look at that 2 in is right in the middle of that dovetail so i'm just going to go ahead and run that across that push that across that this may not be proper dove tailing technique that looks awful slim right there we may have to clean that up but i'm going to come in over here and with this one i'm just going to draw a line this and push that all across that then triple click here delete it oops this is on the other one got some extra geometry there delete that and there we go i said i'm not 100% sure if that's going to pass the doveet tail police um what i may want to do is something grabbing this section and pulling it down yeah even another eighth of an inch oops i grabbed the top two i won't do that uh let's see what would be the best way to do this we probably hide the rest of the model actually we just got to move this one down so if i grab if i want to put an extra e inch grab that piece grab that piece just do do do both sides at the same time we'll drop it down let's yeah let's go down 3/16 of an inch perfect and then we can do the same thing here this is just going to mean selecting this piece and this piece and then we can uh unhide the rest of the model and that way we can actually use snaps to make sure everything's perfect and there we go so pretty quick pretty easy uh not too difficult um but that gives us three different drawers with proper dovetails and yeah sized in couple different ways so uh i think i got everything that was mentioned i didn't i didn't get everything was mentioned one of the other things they talked about we had a in the first video that said when you put dove tails in the first piece and you overlap the second couldn't you use solid tools to trim that and that absolutely would work i didn't do that i drew lines and push pulled um because i did that's what happened so you could absolutely do that put your dove tails on we've done a couple other videos just on dovetails so you could check those out too i think that was a solution i offered put the doveet tails in one use trim to cut it out of the second uh either way works but uh yeah there we go so i just wanted to point this out and say this is why we talk about we ask you for please do please let us know your thoughts on what we're doing um you know fill it in go to comments and tell us your thoughts there's different ways you do it you have questions about how we did it um and we also got a lot of feedback on new ideas for videos different things to model different workflows to show so uh hopefully you will keep doing that because we love this we love doing this but i said it's your ' input that makes makes us know that what we're doing is worth it so if you haven't already done it do click on the down below we appreciate that very much and if you're not subscribed and you've gotten this far in the video you should probably we create a lot of content you be notified of all of it if you and i've already ground this into the ground seems redundant uh but please do leave comments let us know what you think of this if you think there's a different way you should do it if you caught me out on something i didn't do right love hearing it making these videos a lot a more when they're showing something you want to
