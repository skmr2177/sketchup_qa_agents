##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this time let's do some inference locking uh practice [music] examples i love inference locking i think it's always worth uh practicing and making sure that you can just sort of use all kinds of different locking techniques so this is set up to practice a few different ways both with drawing and the move tool that uh you can use inference locking now this is not hard to recreate or recreate something it but if you want to along jump over to the warehouse and i put this file under skill builder inf lock so uh you can download this file along if you this file also has um if we zoom out here this roof example and we'll do this in the next skill builder so this time we're just going to focus here let's jump into it and let's start here what we're going to draw is this shape uh with the line tool using these um blocks for our reference so i'm going to delete this shape and i if you're not at all familiar with inference locking this is not going to be a super basic introduction we're going to kind of move fast but the idea of course is that you can lock a direction so as i'm drawing i can tap the right arrow key to lock the red direction the left arrow key to lock the green direction and the up arrow key to lock the blue direction you can also find a direction and hold the shift key to lock that and we're going to practice both uh you can also lock to a diagonal direction which is what we're going to be doing as well so let's start here i'm going to start drawing a line and i'm going to start moving in the green direction so let's say i tap the left arrow key now i'm locked in the green direction now from here i can lock and reference some of these points but what i want to reference is this edge see the difference between the point and the edge i want to reference the edge because in each of these cases i want uh this shape to merge into these rectangles so i click here and now i'm free to move around again well i can just click here here now if i hover or it already found it we get that purple line but i need to lock that to know how far to draw so i'm drawing here and i can tap the down arrow key and the down arrow key will lock a um a non-axis uh an edge so as i do that then i'm going to hover down here now i don't want the point i want the edge so i click here and now i'm going to start drawing back in the green direction this time instead of using the arrow keys i'm going to start using the shift key because i find in some cases it it can be just faster so hold the shift hover over this edge i'm not clicking hover click then click click hover and hold the shift key right so i'm not worrying about uh finding this edge i'm hovering on it hold the shift key and that locks me to it and then move down here click move down i'll come back to this one in a moment lock the green find the edge click click click hover hold the shift key and i'm locked i can just reference this edge find the green locked in the with the shift key hover click click click hover and this is what i i tend to call this pre-lock right i could hover on this edge hold the shift key and i'm locked to that edge if i let go and hover on this edge hold the shift key i'm locked to that one so i'm just hovering holding the shift key locking click click i love the inference locking engine in sketchup absolutely love it now this one i just wanted this one is um perpendicular and i just wanted to show that the rectangle tool if i click here and hover here for a moment it is also another way to get an inference now i do want to be careful actually this edge if i drew this the other way here here and then draw over i found that the midpoints really close see how close that is and and how it's kind of messing with my rectangle there so just something to be aware of if you're uh always always be aware that there are multiple inferences in sketchup and and sometimes some of them tend to get in the way when you don't want them all right so that's that idea again just to emphasize again i can pre-lock uh which i to do with the shift key i'm hovering over for example this edge hold the shift key i haven't even started drawing but i can hover over this edge click and now that point click hover lock click hover lock click so that's the idea is that you can do some really great inferencing by drawing and holding the shift key or the arrow keys or in some cases pressing the shift key and arrow keys before you're drawing now this is a similar exercise the difference is that i want to line all of these faces up with this surface so we're going to do the similar thing but we're going to be using the move tool so for example i'll start here and i i do want to note see how this is how your blocks if they were groups they tend to be this right because you tend to draw a block group it and then rotate it but the axis is drawn correctly i purposefully if you look at these bounding boxes i purposefully messed up the axis on some of these to force so that you can't use the axis direction so you have to use uh this pre-lock but this one still is so here's the idea i grab this edge invoke the move tool and then i can start moving from that endpoint and in this case i'll just tap the left arrow key the green and again i want to be careful not to this point or this edge i want to hover and lock to this surface and then do the same thing here select this edge use the move tool grab that endpoint and i'll just simply tap the left arrow key to lock because this one is on the green axis click and get outside that group and that's it's lined up and that's what we're going to do to all of these this time because we don't have the luxury of the left axis so if we were to do the left axis right that warps our geometry this time i select the edge use the move tool hover on this edge and hold the shift key so i'm locked to that edge i haven't clicked to move anything yet so i'll click to move this edge i'm still holding the shift key and click here now i can let go of the shift key and i don't even have to orbit i know this edge is through here if i look at x-ray i can kind of imagine where this edge is so i'm drawing a left to right window selecting it use the move move tool hover hold shift click on my endo and now i'm moving that edge referencing the surface clicking to finish and then letting go of the shift key if you haven't done this before it's definitely a sequence that you're going to need to practice right so select move hold the shift pick the correct point hover click and let go of shift you just need to hold shift to hold that lock the entire time but this is this is just good practice for doing that sequence and finally got this last one if you so uh if you're comfortable with it by all means turn turn on the x-ray mode so that you can see through i could hover through this now and grab this point but here i do need to be a little bit careful that uh you know what i'm clicking on because x-ray is on but this is what we were trying to achieve that we were lining all of these up with this surface using inference locking now this example is uh also very similar we're just going to kind of reverse engine engineer that in a couple ways so in this case let's say we use the line tool and i'm going to hover on this edge hold the shift key and i'm locked to that edge now if i h uh hover on this surface and click i know i've started my edge correctly now because this is parallel i could do something hover here and find a parallel to that and again there's going to be multiple ways to do this so i lock that direction click and then maybe i'll just be lazy on this one and push pull this away but we can do the whole thing let's say over here here this time let's turn x-ray mode on and i'm going to hover see how i'm on that face hold the shift key now i only can draw on uh you know in um direction that will be on that plane so as i click here here and i'm going to keep holding shift and work my way through all these edges now i'll finally let go of shift but by locking to that surface i could work my way around one more example of that that let's uh let's have a look at let's say i hold the shift key on this surface so now no matter where i draw i'm just going to draw some random shapes out here that i know are going to be big enough but you see how yep i'm locked to that surface and in this case just to make things simple let me ungroup these and select all of these select this intersect with model and then a little bit of cleanup will get us and if we have some reverse faces which we do looks we might even have a an extra face or two here oh yeah we we you see what's happened uh because i intersected that face it also intersected here which created that extra those extra edges in this case i'm just going to take these three faces reverse them and then delete that geometry and that's that okay so i say uh in the next video we'll go ahead and tack tackle this roof using not all of these but a few inference locking techniques but go ahead and you know try this out on your own i hope that um hope that was clear inference locking i say is a sequence um you've got to know when to tap the arrow key or when to hold the shift key and to keep holding it down and it just takes practice if you haven't done it a lot if you're kind of old school you're really used to using the shift key and then once we introduce the arrow keys that will cover most cases but i it is useful to know both and sometimes it's a little bit faster to use one or the other uh so i find it's just it's useful to practice both hopefully you you got this if not let us know um if there if if this was confusing or if this hopefully made sense i know it's an abstract example say in the next one we'll we'll do a roof a little more something a little more tangible uh but download that file if you want to to do this on your own and thanks for following along see you next time [music]
