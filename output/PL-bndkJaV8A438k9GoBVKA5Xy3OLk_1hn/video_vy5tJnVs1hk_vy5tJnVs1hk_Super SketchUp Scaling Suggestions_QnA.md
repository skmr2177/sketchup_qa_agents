##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at some super successful secrets solely for scaling in sketchup that would just happen is called alliteration so here's what we're going to do we're going to hop in and we're not going to cover the basics of using scale we did that in the square one video a little while ago we'll link to the square one video in the description what i want to do is jump past the basics of how scale works and i want to dive specifically into how you can use scale to change your model some things to note about how scale works some people jump in you know oh yeah scale makes stuff bigger smaller that's true but you can deform geometry you can deform materials uh and there's some stuff in there that people don't generally know about scale and that's the kind of stuff i want to touch on so let's hop in right now first things first we got two things here i got this uh this fountain in a component here and over here i have a group of a one inch cube so one of the things i want to talk about is how you use scale on different objects so these are two very different things with something this one inch cube what i could do is i could come in here i could hit the scale i'm just hitting s on my keyboard to activate the scale shortcut i'm going to drag this this way and i'm gonna tell i want to be exactly 3.5 inches and i'm going to drag it this way exactly 1.5 inches and then this i want to go up and i'll say eight foot enter okay so from that one inch cube i just created an eight foot two by four i have used this specific method to frame entire structures to put in floor framing trusses wall framing everything has come from this one cube there is a lot of editing that happened obviously trusted some stuff had to get cut at angles and that kind of thing but basically the same geometry is used over and over and over again so an important piece of that is that it is a group and not a component because if it's a component as soon as you edit you know i i take one right here and i bring one over here and as soon as i edit this one i got a problem because it's going to change that but uh yeah so i can grab this right here drop that down four feet four feet long and i have two uh two by fours you can even use this method to report upon using something the native report generator because what i can do is i can report on the blue the z-axis length of each of these components to get a cut length so it is important in that case just side note that i do keep this blue axis the length of this piece so if i wanted this to be laying flat on the ground i wouldn't want to use scale to you know distort this length this i wouldn't want to do this this would cause problems because now my blue length is you know my inch and a half what i want to do instead of course is take this piece uh use rotate then to lay that down flat and then the cut length of this piece because the axis stays inside the group would be this four foot still even though it's laying on its side so that's some some super cool easy editing you can do with scale you can take just that cube and you could make all the framing you need with a couple of clicks pretty cool when it comes to let's say none symmetrical geometry this i can use scale of course to change the sizes found is this a little sitting on my desktop a little cute fountain that or is this you know in front of a palace or something is a huge that's pretty easy right scaling the whole thing not a problem if i go and start distorting in other directions though so say i want to just make this scale or make this i don't call it a scale it is a fountain i want to make this fountain taller i can do that but look what happens watch the bass at the very bottom see how that base is squashing or stretching that's because scale always uniformly distorts the geometry so as i stretch it up this it's going to end up with a longer piece up here than it is down here and this might be okay this might i mean this fountain might not be exactly the fountain but i know it represents something that's eight feet tall so i'm going to stretch it up to eight feet and that might not be a big deal i might be oh perfectly okay with that where i want to be careful is doing stuff if i grab this and squish it this way now this is obviously well most likely not what i'm gunning for this is a distortion of the geometry that's making it look weird i mean this could be this is kind of a cool look this uh you know i it i it but um yeah now we're just talking about fun stuff uh but yeah so it is possible to distort but you do have to be conscious when you move something in one direction on the non-symmetrical thing this and it's not a cube basically it's going to distort the geometry it could be good it could be bad it's just something to note and if you know this is going to happen ahead of time i can prevent yourself from ending up with some weird ugly looking geometry because you stretched it out all right let's talk about components everybody knows in the world of sketchup if you come in and you manipulate a component it's going to change both components right so if i grab this this handrail on the end or this this end of this chair i start moving around it moves in both copies i select it from the outside and i hit scale i can actually take this and i can make it smaller without changing this piece over here now that's not without repercussions so i'm going to go ahead and squish this this way and i made a chair out of this bench that's cool but if you look at this metal piece right here see how thin that is versus over here significantly thicker because it took this whole thing and squashed it down you didn't notice it with these horizontal pieces because the cube we played with over here they're just getting scaled along one axis this is okay if i'm doing something you know maybe not that that exaggerated of the scale but if i took this and i wanted to make it you know it's a five foot bench but in i'm using it as a four foot bench so i could scale down that if that's in the grand context of a huge park or something that awesome all good no problem at all obviously if this was gonna get fabricated or something that this metal piece is not the right size anymore that could be an issue if i wanted to do that then i'd have to come in here and you know probably use a combination of maybe move to move this in a specific direction and then i guess i could still use scale on these right here but i'd want to do something that if i wanted to really be careful about maintaining the piece thickness inside here but i did want to point out that you can use scale on the outside without affecting the other copies this is because i'm i'm distorting the container i'm distorting this this blue box that's around it and not the actual geometry so something to think about it's a quick easy way to you know add variants and old diversity to your components in your model uh without messing with every single piece that's in there all right let's talk about materials if i had to pick a question about scale that comes up the most often on our forum forums.sketchup.com for those of you who have not been there i would say it has to do with scaling materials so i have two identical squares here with the exact same materials on them this right here is just a face yes raw geometry this right here is a group it could be a component doesn't matter they behave the same in this instance if i grab this face over here and i hit scale and i start scaling look what happens i'm scaling down the geometry but the material that's applied to it is staying the same that is intentional that's how it's supposed to work if i grab this piece right here and hit scale this is the group as i scale it look what happens it shrinks that because again just the bench i had over here this is taking the container the wrapper around it and squishing it so everything inside squishes together and that means the material as well so if you want to scale something and have it maintain the default geometry you do have to scale the geometry on the outside if you scale every scale component or group or anything from the outside it's going to squash down the material because you are that's what you're telling to do you're saying take it from the outside and rescale the whole thing all right one last thing i want to touch on this is the thing that there's several ways that that this issue uh brings itself to light so right here i have a little toy car i come in here i got uh the body and then i think each of these wheels both sides yeah so that's a component and then inside there got some nesting going on there we go there's two so i have a couple pieces here i grabbed that made a copy scaled it up by five so that's all i did was this is the group not a component made a copy scaled five boom that was it that got me this now if i select this i have the option to reset scale if i hit reset scale look what happens it goes right back to the size of the original geometry i could actually come in here piece by piece so i could grab this piece and say just reset the scale on that guy and then you reset scale and then you this is gonna be bad because it's gonna be all this different location now but i can reset each of these pieces individually or i said you do it all as a group now this is not a good thing or a bad thing this is just a thing this is how this works this is it could be a great way to get back to where you were it can also cause problems the biggest problem that i see people hit here is they scale at a large scale they you know i do this too so this is not this is not calling anybody out or complaining but i'll model at a large scale and then afterwards take the whole container and scale it down to what size it's supposed to be that's fine but the problem is if you hit rescale on something that was you know 30 feet and then you scale it down to three inches and you hit rescale it's going to go back to 30 feet so it is something to be there's you know a caution on there uh if you do have reset scale on something that's small you may run into a problem because it may shoot it back up to the scale you scale to that you can always fix that if i have something that's small that would scale larger just right clicking and exploding and then making it a group again will reset that geometry so you don't have that problem uh just something to be conscious of you notice on this one reset scale is disabled because this is at the original scale this guy right here that's bigger he has reset scale so i hit that it scales it back down now that i click on it reset scale is disabled because it's at the default scale so that is a handful of suggestions specifically for scale when using sketchup so i said hopefully nobody's let down by the fact that we didn't go into basics and how to use scale and modifier keys and all that i said check the check the description down below and you should see a link to a square one video that will give you that information that's simple stuff uh this i wanted more to be a little bit you know the next level this is what i call level up sketchup you know take sketchup to the next level if you that video go ahead and click down below if you haven't already please do if you know somebody who would benefit from this i don't mean that a bad win isn't it don't use this as a disc don't don't call somebody out on their weak scaling skills by sending this video but if you know some new models with sketchup and they might get some out of this it with them that'd be awesome and of course please we create several videos this each and every week and you'll be notified of every one of them if you and to top it all off leave us a i know i'm asking for a lot guide but uh yeah let us know what you think of this do you have a scaling tip that i missed i love hearing that sometimes and we do these every week so we have a lot of stuff going on and every once in a while we'll miss something love hearing you go oh here's how i use scale here's a tip that i found out leave that in the comments down below see you next time thanks foreign
