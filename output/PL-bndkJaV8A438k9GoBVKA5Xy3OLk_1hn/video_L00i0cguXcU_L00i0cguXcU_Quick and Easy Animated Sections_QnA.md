##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: quick and easy animated sections video id: l00i0cguxcu playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at adding animated sections to your model so what's an animated section that's when you take something well you're going to take your 3d model and kind of move through it and cut through it one slice at a time and see the insides all the way through that's taking a camera and just kind of pushing it through going through walls everything just seeing all of it and this can i mean a normal section is something we just have a normal tool for you go and you put a section it cuts the model off and you look inside it from there but an animated section actually takes that plane and moves it through the model as you transition from one scene to the next it seems it could be daunting but it's actually incredibly easy and we'll take a look at how to do it right now all right so i have a model i intentionally went and grabbed a model from the three warehouse that was a longer model right so this would be fun to add a section through here so a couple things we're going to use to do this this uh this animation so we're going to use our scenes over here i'm going to look i'm going to open up scenes and we're going to use this section tool tools intersection section is under tools and then right down here i have section plane so i'm going to use section plane and scenes that's it this is going to be very very very simple um so what we're going to start with is we're going to come in and we're going to put a section where we want to put the first cut so i'm going to start that on the outside over here i'm going to go to tools let me go to section plane and i'm just going to let that just going to snap it right right to the side with green boom that i'm going to call this start we'll start with a little one there all right so that's number one so now before i do anything else what i'm going to do i can right click on this make sure it's active yes this is what i want this is active and i'm going to come over here and i'm going to say create a new scene but before i click the plus button hopefully if you're following along you were slow and didn't do it already i'm going to come down here to what i want to include so i have the option right here to choose what i want to include with this all i want to see in this in this scene i'm about to create is where the section is at so i'm going to turn everything except for active section plane off all of it's turned off only include an animation turned on so turn all the rest of them off and i'm going to hit plus and that creates my first scene that's good you call it scene one that's cool i don't care now i'm going to create another section plane so i'm going to come over here i'm going to kind of come right here i'll take it all the way out to the end of this deck here so we'll go to tools again section plane again um i might be able to snap to the end now i'm just going to hit the left arrow key to lock it to green and then just click right here i'm going to call this end okay now a couple things are happening here right now we have two section planes only one section plane can be active at a time and right now it should be number two it is it's the active cut it's also facing the wrong way right it's cutting this direction i want it to actually cut the other direction so i'm going to right click on it i'm gonna say reverse and everything's gonna disappear but that's okay so you can see here's what's going to happen well let me let me back up let's go ahead and say this in a scene before i do anything else so i'm just going to come over here active section plane is still the only thing turned on i'm just going to hit plus i got scene two so scene one this is active scene two this is active what's going to happen now is as i transition from one scene to the next sketchup is going to animate one section plane to the other so if i come to scene one i click all i'm going to do is click on scene one it's going to run back look at this it's going to run back through the whole model until it gets back to where that first section plane was placed oh yeah that's the stuff that was cool now because we didn't save anything camera location that i can come in here and figure out where do i want to look at this from let's try this let's hit scene two yeah look at that cuts through that's pretty cool i that let's get let's get to the point where i'm just staring right down i just want to see this this thing just get built right in my face let's try this here it comes also a 3d movie so you can see each of the pieces getting built very cool very simple animation now this is taking you know a few seconds to animate that's all part of my my settings right so if i come in here to view animation and i go to settings i currently have this set at 10 seconds uh let's just for the sake of brevity let's drop this down and say we're going to see that as five seconds instead and then you can hit this button yeah look at it go through there that's awesome very cool one of the things i don't care before in this though is that my section planes show through the whole thing right so here i can see them i don't that very much so i want to go ahead and get rid of them so i'm going to go ahead and just grab both of them right now i'm going to right click on them and just hide them and this one's highlighted oh it's because it's active um now if i hit play oh yeah look at that you'll notice i didn't have to go back in and update the scene with the hidden sections because the state of the visibility of those sections wasn't saved because the only thing that was saved was the section plane so very nice way easy way to uh you know save yourself some work later on this and then hit that again i love it look at it look at oh beautiful i feel getting built better than i it disappearing though i think this is cool how it comes out uh i could see this as an animation for a product this container on as a product or something that um it is a little quick though so i might actually come in here to animation and hit settings open that up to i don't know 10 felt it was dragging let's see if eight feels better yeah i think that's it uh very cool so that's it i don't know if you are counting but the actual process of adding the scene or adding the sections and then adding the scenes the whole thing takes about three or four minutes it is very simple very easy to do uh again i would recommend any time you're working with scenes be conscious of what information you're actually saving with the scene this this will bite you all the time i mean it gets me constantly where i just i'll just save everything but i didn't need everything i only needed one or two things so if you're conscious of that it's going to save you some pain that hiding hiding my two section planes i just did it and i didn't have to update anything so there we go that's all it takes a couple of clicks a couple session planes couple scenes and you can have this very cool building or unbuilding animation created in sketchup so hopefully you that if you haven't seen that before i said when you see that animation oh that's cool how that happened very easy very simple to do a couple of clicks and you can have it in your own model if you that video go ahead and click down below maybe this with somebody uh maybe leave us a have you ever done this before do you use section planes or animations at all how to use them are they different from what we just did love to hear what you're thinking if you don't already you should probably if you made it this far in this video it means you have some appetite for sketchup and we aim to serve you as much tasty sketchup as we possibly can all right we'll see you next time thank you [music]
