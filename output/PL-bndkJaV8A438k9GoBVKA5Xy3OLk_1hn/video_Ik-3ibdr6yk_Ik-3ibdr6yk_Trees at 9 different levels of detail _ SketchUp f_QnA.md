##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik-3ibdr6yk uploader: sketchup duration: 885 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:14:43.502807 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today we're going to level up our sketchup skills by taking a comprehensive look at a variety of different vegetation components that you might find yourself using in your model so if you're me you probably come into any one of these videos asking yourself okay so vegetation components i get it how many are there there's 2d and there's 3d most things in sketchup and i think that that's where i want to say that actually there's a little bit more than that i think especially when you're browsing for stuff on the 3d warehouse you might find something that looks pretty good then once you drop it in your model it doesn't really work that well or even if it works well it may stylistically contrast with some other elements in your model so i want to take this time to kind of go through each of the different kinds including render trees so that you can see the difference and make the best pick that's going to work for you and your needs so i've got my model here i've got some trees already in it now i'm going to start with 2d because in this case i want to kind of work my way up with complexity so i think as always i would recommend a 2d face me tree as your starting point and the reason why is because you can always replace components so in this case it doesn't make any sense to really start a model with really high poly vegetation when you're still working in your model and you're still moving things around and you're sort of adding that complexity or you're adding potentially some performance uh decreases when early in the process when you don't need to do the face me tree stylistically you can see in this example it actually works really well it complements uh sketchup and sort of the clean lines that you might get in an early conceptual model so if you do want to stick with 2d trees but you're not wanting something that maybe feels cartoonish or unrealistic there is of course the realistic the photorealistic 2d tree now this is just an image if i kind of tilt this way you can see that is just a 2d image it's a png that was imported and it was made face me so when i rotate the camera it follows me now one thing to keep in mind if you do bring in a png image they do not transparency so you would in this case here's one that's been exploded this first one has not been exploded which is why it's not casting a shadow the second one has been exploded but you can see the shadow that's being cast is not very realistic at all you wouldn't want that so in this case if you are working with a tree that you picked out yourself and you're not downloading from somewhere else it may be worth the time to come in here and if i just kind of switch to hidden line style and turn my hidden geometry on you can kind of see the level of sort of edge fidelity or detail that i took in tracing out this particular tree and in this case i'm getting a much better shadow so one thing i found though that you know combining these two different styles diagrammatic and photo really sometimes looks a little bit weird so for me my recommendation is just if you're going to go one way go that way and stick to it and again it's really more about consistency than it is about any one particular tree type or style so that's 2d definitely got a couple options to consider but there's some more uh you know this is a 3d modeling program so let's pop over to 3d and talk about some of the differences i want to start with low poly so one way to do low poly with a 3d tree is actually to combine methods so we just looked at a png texture used for a the entire tree but this case here if i turn hidden geometry on switch to hidden line style you can see that this is a png texture that was brought in and bent so that it looks gravity is kind of pulling the leaf down and it's being applied to 3d geometry for the trunk and the branches and again here is the what it looks with just one leaf isolated and i'll turn that texture back on just so that you can see that let's turn our shadows on here though and just so that you can see the shadow here that's being cast same as i just showed it is going to be a square shadow now that may or may not matter to you and from a distance this kind of blocky or boxy shadow may be perfectly fine or it may not be again it just depends on where it shows up in your scene and the level of detail and sort of realism you're striving for if if you're looking for something a little bit more realistic you're seeing over here then you would want to take the time to just kind of quickly cut out around the leaf and then all of a sudden you're going to go from a square shadow to something that's much more articulated now it's going to add a little bit of geometry anything in sketchup it's going to add you know instead of going from whatever this is you know four edges all the way around to something 16 or 10 it's going to add a little bit more geometry to the model but it shouldn't be a big problem this is a low poly tree after all um just something to consider now if you know you're going to go to render it may not be worth this effort i know that this is a level up sketchup and not beyond desktop but you know i mean these trees do we do want to think about how they affect rendering in this case you can see it just doesn't matter if you look at the two different shadows v-ray or whatever your rendering engine of choice is will handle them exactly the same way because your rendering engine actually doesn't care about the png transparency the way that sketchup does so just keep in mind it just depends on what your final use is as to whether or not this sort of low poly or low resolution shadow versus a higher poly higher resolution shadow makes a difference for you so staying in low poly but staying but switching to a full 3d tree so instead of relying on a group of leaves to act as a texture you could actually find one that uses geometry full geometry so again turning hidden line style you can see that each one of these leaves are actually just a face that's been colored and the branches themselves are just solid colors sometimes you'll find with your 3d trees that a lot of the size when you bring one in that's quite large it may not be the geometry itself in this case this is fairly low poly fairly responsive if i were to try come over here and even with my shadows on make a copy of the tree you can see it responds quickly sometimes the size of the tree is the textures so if you have something with lots of textures that may actually increase the file size even if it doesn't change you know the geometry count so get rid of that backup one that second one don't need that so not a bad looking tree i do the shadow so if i sort of adjust the shadows you can see kind of the difference on the shadows just are a little bit more accurate because each leaf is casting you know that shadow directly so again if shadows matter then something to consider as well when choosing a low poly tree so those are our low poly trees let's switch over to talk about working with a high poly tree now i've got one here i'm going to recreate this in just a second i've already done this myself just as for practice i'm going to hide this but that's a little sneak preview of where we're going um this tree here was purchased from biz park so if you are familiar with their assets they've got some nice 3d stuff so you can see i've got not only a 3d tree but i've got some really high-res photo realistic textures along with the pbr maps normal bump all reflection opacity any of that stuff that you might associate with rendering will also come in with this tree as well that's why i mentioned that before with file sizes so i return my hidden line style on turn my hidden geometry on and you can see this is a fairly high poly tree at about half a million polygons so you can see you're going to get much more detail than you uh would with any of the other trees that we've looked at so far so the only challenge here with this one is that with one tree at half a million polygons and you know 100 megabytes per tree because of those textures you may see your file getting quite large quite fast so that's where that technique of making a proxy which i'm going to just go ahead and unhide this one so depending on if you're rendering or not this tree is actually designed for rendering so if you're just going to fly through or snap some views from sketchup then you may be getting more detail in your tree than you need or in your component but if you do know you're going to go to rendering and you do know that you're working with these trees and moving them around and rotating them and making lots of let's see i'm going to stamp a few around you can see that having something this tree this proxy tree could be really helpful so v-ray for example has the option to export a proxy so if i select this and say export proxy you can go ahead and say well how many i want to maybe reduce the amount of triangles that shows up it's going to send it to your hard drive and when you render it loads all that information all those materials all of that geometry it's going to load it in at render time only so the nice thing about that is if i click render here you can see even though i have this sort of light looking placeholder tree which is the proxies because to me that's a kind of means the same thing as placeholder so it makes the model it keeps it light but all that detail and all that photorealism and stuff is still there it just loads it at render time so that's a pretty cool feature if you are working with these really really high poly trees just consider doing that maybe sooner rather than later so that you're not um finding sort of any performance issues as you add more and more vegetation to your model so speaking of render only this sort of proxy method i made one custom here but that could be time consuming if you have a hundred different trees and you want them all to be proxies so i want to show you one last tree which is one that's already comes in as what i'm going to say render ready as a proxy in sketchup so you can see this is if i turn my shadows on i get just a simple shadow turn my hidden geometry on i have a simple canopy very very light very very low poly but the advantages here is that this one on the left comes from what's called chaos cosmos so if your v-ray user you actually have options for browsing for trees and you get these really high poly trees let me see here you can just pick one and when you find one that you you can download it from the internet and it comes with your license it's built by max tree so you know it's coming from a trusted source and you import it and there it is so you can see that in this case you can search for not just trees but anything that's going to be really really high poly in um that comes from cosmos will come in as a proxy already so they've already done the hard work by creating that proxy for you and then when you go to render here let me just press that render button one more time you go to render there it is you get this very very highly detailed model that still stays very very light and i this because you can see that it's got this nice canopy shape so you can see where the branches are so if you wanted to rotate this around you could do that and i think that would just makes it just a little bit easier to see sort of replacement especially when you have multiple trees and you want them to look a little bit different from each other you know you may want to it's going to be much easier to see using that proxy shape so that's really helpful i want to show you one more before i move on and that's because for some of you v-ray cosmos on cloud library may be somewhat new but for me i've been using these trees called lab work for quite a while so lab work is a german company that makes trees that sort of function the same way here's a proxy tree that's a lab work tree so you can browse by just kind of scrolling through all of these different not just trees but shrubs and things as well and what they do is they come in as placeholders the same way that we just did with the chaos cosmos ones now keep in mind lab work is the extension is free but the plants are paid so i just want to always point that out so if you do really the quality of these you know they may be worth purchasing and then the other thing that's cool about lab work is that you have these options in this case i could say i can click the plant attribute editor and i can go fall winter summer so if i go to summer you can see the canopy changes colors and the other thing i can do is i can say well do i want this to be fully grown young middle aged i actually have quite a few options here so just one tree actually from lab work is worth the equivalent of 36 trees when you count four seasons three ages and three varieties so lastly i'm just going to kind of press render on those ones and see what that looks let's see really quick and there they are so if i zoom in as well you're going to get you're going to get that really really high resolution that high poly or fidelity that you get but you're going to keep the model actually running relatively light so you can't really see my shrubs under there but they're there too so that's cool i've been talking about trees mostly but of course everything i mentioned does apply to shrubs as well let me stop that because that pretty much wraps up our review for today so that's pretty much it i know that i covered a lot but i said that in my intro that there's actually more kinds of tree or vegetation components than you might think and i think i i showed that here is that the reason that we want to take this into consideration is not to add complexity to our model but to remove it by pre-thinking what's going to work well for us whether that's aesthetically or whether that's geometry count for performance we can choose specifically what we know is going to work the best and i hope that when you go forward with your models that you can make those same kinds of better decisions so let me know as always in the comments if any of this is new to you if it works for you if i missed one i'm sure there's probably a few more options out there that i didn't cover let me know in the comments we'll keep that conversation going there and before you go don't forget to and um as always and we will see you next time [music] thank you
