##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i want to talk to you about a controversial topic groups are temporary okay so yeah not killer controversial but uh i do want to talk about the concept of using groups for a little bit and then getting rid of them and how that works uh not all the time i mean groups are still going to be good we'll talk about when when to use groups when not and where you might just use them as tools let's take a look right now all right so first things first let's talk about general use of groups so groups we have videos on this too if you if you're if you're what's a group uh that's cool no problem uh go ahead and go into our web or into our youtube channel and search for groups and components and you'll learn all about them um what a group does primarily is isolates geometry so as soon as i go and start drawing i draw some stuff i drew this this shape right here this board uh idea being that this uh metal maybe a metal piece slots into this gap on the board that's that's the idea here so if i wanted to when this when i'm done modeling this i would come in select right click make it a group now this group is isolated so that means i can take this piece right here i can drop it right here and then if i want to move it later i can take it away if i don't do that if these were just all raw geometry and i was to grab this right here pick it up plop it in here this is cringe stuff right cu then when i take that and i move it a it's all connected it's all stuck together this is sketchup uh sticky geometry doing exactly what it's supposed to do which says two segments come in line with each other they join all right so i'm going to undo that and i'm going to put that back into a group and i'm going to put this back into a group all right so that i mean that's that is the fundamentally why we use groups right there but i'm going to propose an idea what if there's other reasons we want to use a group i'm say i'm going to put this one right here and then in this slot right here i need a similar holder that where the height's the same but this this round piece for whatever reason is turned 90¬∞ okay so maybe something sits inside here and i need one that goes the other direction so if i come into the group i'm going to double click uh that's another thing if you want to get in and change geometry in your group just double click don't don't be exploding that's that's not necessary there are times where it makes sense to explode and we'll see that but not right now so if i want to turn this 90¬∞ um just kind of as a tip if i want to turn that around the middle of this cylinder if i go to view and i turn on my hidden geometry i'll get that dotted line and i can just kind of move my camera right above see here's the middle line so when i go to rotate i can hover hover till i find the middle hit the up arrow to lock into that blue axis and then grab it and turn it 90¬∞ now looking from here it doesn't look too bad but if i come down here and see what that did that was not ideal that was that is not what i want want to have be happening right here actually you know doing some cleanup here could be kind of cool but this is not the thing i want what i want is this piece down here similar to where it is before but with this turn sideways so i can't do that because undo of sketchup sticky geometry what i can do is i can grab this i can rightclick and i can make it its own group as soon as i make it its own group look what happen it is now separate from this section below so you'll notice that it did duplicate geometry right this edge right here these edges coming around here are both in this group and in this group that's cool that's awesome that's the way it should be it should be that um but what's not happening is these two are no longer connected so what i could do now is i go through the process of turning this then putting it down rejoining with the bottom i'm going to take an extra step right here and group select everything down here right click make that into a separate group now realistically as long as one of these two pieces is inside of a group uh i'm good right because if this is in a group it can't merge anything down here so raw gam down here is safe i to put in its own group because say i was to do something i'll put this back down here and then when i go to grab this group for whatever reason if i do a group select right now this i'm not getting any of the geometry that's part of this lower group because i'm not selecting that group i'm dragging left to right using that solid group only things that are totally inside of that selection window gets selected this is safe cu i can't select it so not a requirement but something worth considering all right so i'm going to go ahead and take this and i'm going to use the handles oops wrong guy i'm going to take the handles rotate it around the middle 90¬∞ come over here i'm noticing you can see that's off center right so i'm just going to move it to center i'm just going to grab this and move it right over to center have line up that perfect um so obviously this geometry is not going to close up i got gaps and everything so one of the things about putting in a group that's kind of nice is i can do something double click and then just edit this geometry um right now obviously this geometry is hard to see because this other shadow geometry is in the way but that's easy enough because i can go to view component edit say hide rest a model and now i can do something uh let's just draw a rectangle from here to here delete this little arc delete this little arc and then uh if we go back up so i actually have a shortcut key assigned to high addressive model so i can toggle it over real quick with a a shortcut key i do that a lot when i model in groups or components i can take this and i can move it straight down and i just want that to kind of bury itself in that maybe maybe i'll go a little bit further and i'll take this piece right up to the edge this thing all right so maybe that's what my holder needs to look so the base is looking pretty good top obviously has an issue so let's slip let's uh flip over grab that okay so yeah i got to get this over here so i'm going to go to view again high address the model and i want to get this over here so there's a couple ways i could do this i could click here click here erase this erase this and i could do that each time around the half this half a circle uh but not everybody enjoys doing or watching stitching so much as i do that's what that's called when stitch geometer together so what i can do instead is turn so i'm looking at right on the edge this do a group select left to right that so that i get just the lines of this arc right here and watch this if i just go to move grab it slide it over then i can just hit delete and it's closed up so model smarter not harder as much as i would have enjoyed sitting there and clicking and clicking and putting all stitching all that stuff together uh that's probably a better quicker easier way to do it all right so now i bring these two back awesome they are looking perfect uh another advantage of grouping geometry as you work on it is if this is a solid tool or a solid group i can use solid tools to just put these two together this one right here is not solid so if i was to go in and try to figure out what this was i would probably want to take it looks okay from the outside i'm going to turn off go view hidden geometry and turn it off so the circles don't look quite so weird but if i look at this in 3d space this looks pretty good um so what i to do if i have a problem is double click i'm just going to right click and hide the bottom face and see right away oh here's the problem i have this face on the inside delete that edit unhide last and now i got a solid tool and i said because i have these two pieces i can select both of them go to tools just say outer shell that'll work just fine and there we go now i have a new version of whatever this holder is i can pick up in its group plop it right over here and drop it right where it needs to be and again it's still in a group now because for whatever reason odds are good if i was really modeling this this would be a component this would be a different component uh but anyhow the the the the object it sits in the container it sits in can be temporary so when i do want to do that it's a great way to isolate geometry and separate geometry from the rest of the model and let you do easy cleanup and merging geometry that so again not saying all groups are temporary but there's a chance that you can use a group to temporarily isolate geometry and make edits that uh yeah let me know if you've done this before let me if you've done something let me know if you have a workflow that does this specifically or maybe something slightly different uh i'm not saying i have you know all of it figured out obviously but i love to hear what you are doing how you're using sketchup and tell me did i miss some is there a better way to do this is there a different way to do this if you haven't already please click down below and obviously ly we create a lot of videos and you know about all of them including our live streams every friday if you most importantly i was just saying leave us a down below tell us what you think of this let us know if you have other ideas you think would make a good video we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
