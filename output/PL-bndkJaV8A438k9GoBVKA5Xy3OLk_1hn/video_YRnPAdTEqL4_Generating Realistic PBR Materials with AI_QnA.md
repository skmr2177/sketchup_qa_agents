# Generating Realistic PBR Materials with AI

### 1. What is PBR and why is it important in SketchUp?
**Answer:**
PBR stands for "Physically Based Rendering" and refers to really good-looking materials that behave realistically with light. In SketchUp 2025 and later, you can assign material properties to imported images to create PBR materials that interact properly with environmental lighting.

✅ **Key Point**: PBR materials make your models look much more realistic and professional.

### 2. How do I import an image to create a PBR material?
**Answer:**
To import an image for PBR material creation:
- Go to **File > Import**
- Select your image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Drag the imported image onto your model surface
- The image will be applied as a texture with default PBR properties

⚠️ **Note**: The imported material will have default metalness and roughness values that you can adjust.

## AI Material Generation

### 3. How does AI material generation work in SketchUp?
**Answer:**
The AI material generation feature:
- **Analyzes your image**: Looks at the image content and name
- **Creates seamless tiles**: Generates a seamlessly tiling material
- **Auto-generates maps**: Creates roughness and normal maps automatically
- **Processes in the cloud**: Uses AI to enhance your material
- **Improves over time**: The AI engine gets better with each use

✅ **Pro Tip**: The AI engine is constantly learning, so results may vary over time.

### 4. What is the "Generate Material" button and when should I use it?
**Answer:**
The "Generate Material" button (sparkly button) uses AI to:
- Create a seamlessly tiling texture from your image
- Automatically generate roughness maps
- Generate normal maps for surface detail
- Improve the overall material quality

**Use it when**:
- Your imported image doesn't tile well
- You want more realistic material properties
- You need normal maps for surface detail
- You want to enhance a basic texture

### 5. How do I adjust the AI-generated material properties?
**Answer:**
After AI generation, you can adjust:
- **Metalness**: Controls how metallic the surface appears (0-1)
- **Roughness**: Controls surface smoothness (0-1)
- **Normal Map**: Controls surface relief and detail
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Controls shadow intensity in crevices

✅ **Tip**: Use the sliders to fine-tune the material until it looks realistic for your specific use case.

## Material Properties and Settings

### 6. What are the default PBR settings for imported materials?
**Answer:**
Default settings for imported materials:
- **Metalness**: 0.13 (slightly metallic)
- **Roughness**: 0.5 (medium roughness)

These can be changed in **Settings > Graphics > Automatically Enhanced Materials** or adjusted manually for each material.

### 7. How do I adjust metalness and roughness for different materials?
**Answer:**
Adjust based on material type:

**For Drywall/Plaster**:
- Metalness: 0 (no shine)
- Roughness: 0.7-0.9 (matte finish)

**For Finished Wood**:
- Metalness: 0.1-0.3 (slight shine)
- Roughness: 0.3-0.6 (semi-gloss)

**For Carpet**:
- Metalness: 0 (no shine)
- Roughness: 0.8-0.9 (very matte)

**For Metal**:
- Metalness: 0.8-1.0 (highly reflective)
- Roughness: 0.1-0.3 (smooth surface)

### 8. How do normal maps work and how should I adjust them?
**Answer:**
Normal maps create surface detail by:
- **Analyzing shadows**: AI determines high and low points from your image
- **Creating relief**: Simulates 3D surface detail on a flat texture
- **Enhancing realism**: Makes materials look more three-dimensional

**Adjustment tips**:
- Use the slider to control the intensity
- Too high: Looks like stucco or extreme texture
- Too low: Looks like a flat image
- **25-50%** is usually good for most materials

### 9. What is ambient occlusion and how do I use it?
**Answer:**
Ambient occlusion:
- **Creates shadows**: Adds dark areas in crevices and corners
- **Enhances depth**: Makes materials look more realistic
- **Intensifies detail**: Emphasizes surface irregularities

**Adjustment guidelines**:
- **Stone/Brick**: Higher values for dramatic shadows
- **Drywall**: Lower values for subtle shadows
- **Carpet**: Moderate values to show fiber detail

## Best Practices for Material Creation

### 10. What makes a good source image for AI material generation?
**Answer:**
Good source images should have:
- **Uniform lighting**: Same brightness across all edges
- **Consistent color**: No dramatic color variations
- **Even edges**: Top, bottom, left, and right should match
- **Adequate detail**: Enough texture without being too busy
- **Proper scale**: Appropriate level of detail for your use

⚠️ **Avoid**: Images with shadows, uneven lighting, or dramatic color variations at the edges.

### 11. How do I take better photos for material creation?
**Answer:**
For better material photos:
- **Use even lighting**: Avoid shadows and bright spots
- **Take multiple shots**: Try different angles and lighting
- **Check edges**: Ensure all sides have similar brightness
- **Use proper scale**: Get close enough for detail but far enough for uniformity
- **Avoid shadows**: Don't cast shadows on the material

✅ **Pro Tip**: It may take 5-8 photos to get one good enough for seamless tiling.

### 12. How do I fix tiling issues in my materials?
**Answer:**
To fix tiling problems:
- **Scale the texture**: Right-click > Texture > Position to adjust scale
- **Larger scale**: Reduces visible repetition
- **Smaller scale**: Shows more detail but may repeat more
- **Adjust properties**: Fine-tune metalness and roughness
- **Regenerate**: Use AI generation to create better tiling

### 13. What should I do if I don't like the AI-generated result?
**Answer:**
If you're not satisfied with the AI result:
- **Undo and retry**: Edit > Undo, then hit generate again
- **Try different images**: Use a better source photo
- **Adjust manually**: Fine-tune the properties yourself
- **Wait and retry**: AI improves over time, so try again later

✅ **Remember**: AI results can vary, and the engine is constantly improving.
