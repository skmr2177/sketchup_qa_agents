##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

2025-07-23t08:31:58.049693 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about how to use tags and scenes to explore [music] options so we've done something this before but uh i did want to talk about specifically to interior design and some ways you can use things i also wanted to cover a couple things that i've seen recently uh about how people think scenes and tags work and they don't work the way that i've seen people thinking they should work work so i wanted to cover that as well but what we're going to do is we're going to go into this living room right here and look at a couple different ways we could arrange the furniture and we'll save both of them so we can flip back and forth with a button click let's check it out all right so here we have uh just this little building vignette with some walls and inside we have some furniture so i group i mean we could do this piece by piece by piece but i just to make this easier i grouped the furniture into groups so over here we have against this wall is a piece of art uh a couch and then a end table uh on this side we have a couch some end tables chairs and a different piece of art and then here below the window we have uh a couple chairs and a little end table as well uh there's a coffee table in the middle we're just going to leave that where it is and we're going to look at the how this all could work if maybe maybe we wanted to switch these so put you know i i think the art goes together the colorful one with the gray couch and the colorful couch with the black and white photo i think that works so let's i was saying just as a whole i'm going to keep these sets of furniture together and just flip them so let's figure out how how we could do that um what i don't want to do is have to have multiple models that i switch between or anything that i want to keep this simple so what we're going to do is we're going to use tags and scenes to make it so i can real quickly and easily just check out one thing or what get out of here all right sorry about that some s loose geometry sneaks in and tries to ruin my day so we're going to see what that looks so first thing we'll do is we will save this setup so this setup is the first one we going to look at so i'm going to go over here to tags and uh i'm going to start by looking at tags so i have some uh tags in here there are different um i don't know different materials imported from 3d warehouse that kind of thing so i'm going to make a a new tag and this new tag is going to be op option a enter and i'm going create a second one called op sh b you probably already figured that one out um and then i'm going to take this group this group and this group and assign all three of those to option a so i'm going to come in here i'm going say put all these on option a and there we go now if i turn option a off my furniture goes more loose geometry trying to ruin my day all right so all the geometry goes away if i turn off option a that's perfect that's what i want now what i want to do is i want to create a new thing on option b where the furniture is different so i'm going to go back into option a i'm going to select these three pieces i'm going to copy them and paste them just out here off to the side that sort of thing so now i have a copy of both now i'm going to take them all right now before i do anything else and i'm going to put them on option b so now when option a goes away my furniture for option b is still here i'm going to take this here's what i'm going to do for option b we're going to get rid of these tables here we're going to grab this stuff right here flip it around 180¬∞ and then we'll just plunk that right against the wall that and then we'll drop it down so uh it's on the ground which just you know i don't want to judge you for how you do things but i my couches on the ground okay pull it for a little more that looks all right um i obviously the end tables this stuff needs to be on the outside so i'm going to make a change i'm going to go into this group and i'm going to grab these pieces slide them over this direction and then uh we can actually flip them i with that that and we'll slide it back over that looks good and then this one right here same thing come in here we'll grab this and this we'll take that right over here this way and i liked it the way it was too with the actually i kind of that that's kind of whoa i don't know what's going on there actually uh i feel that needs to be in there any i doesn't matter um i could do cleanup but that's not what we're here for so now my option b is reversed so i can switch these by going tags boom tags boom but that's a pain in the butt so i don't want to have to click stuff on and off i just want a single button to say option a option b and i can flip back between them and this is where scenes come into play i'm going to close entity info i'm going and expand scenes and i want to see all of scenes so first thing i'm going to do is okay so let's get option a set up this is where we started option a so what i want to do is i want to make a scene that shows all these things are visible so i'm going to come in here and i'm going to say turn turn everything off except visible tags everything else gets turned off and then i can go ahead and create a scene all right and i'm going to call this uh furniture a okay so now i have an option for furniture a now i'm going to swap i'm going to turn a off off b on and i'm going to create a new scene and that new scene also has only visible tags on and i'm going to call that also furniture b so now what i can do is i can swap just with the click a and b i can switch between the two sets and the cool thing is because the only thing that these scenes are connected to is the visibility tag means i can walk around and look at this model so i'm look i'll look at it right here i'll look this and see what does this look a b a b i'll flip around look over here how's this look from this side how if i switch it oh yeah i that uh and i can make my decision based on i while i'm orbiting around i can swap between the two so this is a pretty cool feature if you're trying to show somebody options uh you can do it this way so i said i was going to mention things it doesn't do so what scenes or tags don't do is they don't control location of geometry so that's why the first thing i did after i set up option a was i copied it all out and put it on a different tag option b so this sofa right here this is in the model two times this one's in the model two times this picture in the model two times it only controls the state of visibility it does not control location so some people try to make animations in sketchup by grabbing something all right so i'm going to have this here and then the second scene i'm going to have it over here expecting it to move across the scene as they or move across the screen as they change scenes that's not how sketchup works what sketchup does is it looks at all of these settings and says okay activate these settings that are saved for the scene so for this one by switching scenes all we're doing is saying check which tags are visible and set them to this so that's why so it's nice because the other thing that people think with scenes is that scenes is be probably because of the name it always controls where the camera's at but it does not have to if camera location's not turning on this i can swap between it and this the camera never has to move at all so very powerful way to use the tools that are already there i know some people use scenes for just animations some people use scenes just to set the camera but remember scenes can do so much more all this stuff can be turned on and off so i mean you could have a scene that is just dedicated to control rolling your section planes flipping section planes on off maybe we'll do that next let me know in the comments you want me to see me create a section plane uh scenes because that could be kind of cool too but yeah so check that out if you are doing something a layout or alternative ways to view models or rearrange stuff quick and easy super simple just uh set up those two tags and then assign each tag on a visible tag only scene and you can flip right between them so i'm hoping that that connects with someone um i think it's a cool way to do it i've used this on a lot of different projects as ways to just flip through stuff we've done this a little bit we did this is kind of a a variant of the thing we did around the holidays last year where we did chasing lights very similar the thing to remember is that tags and scenes don't move stuff they just turn turn it on and off so you can mimic animation or things moving by doing that a you know still frame animation kind of thing but for the most part if you're using animation or if you're using those scenes you're just setting the state of what's visible right now and just remember the big thing if there's anything to remember it's that not everything has to be turned on you can turn on just certain items and then that'll only activate those things in that scene if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you more importantly than that though more importantly than anything leave us a down below and let us know what you think is this useful did you get something out of this uh do you have a different way you would do something this love to hear about that too i love to hear your workflows when you have them and they help me out a lot uh most importantly though do you have an idea for a video you think would you would us to see or us to make we'll see it you'll see it when we make it uh let us know about that too we making these videos a lot we me more when just showing something you want to see thank you
