##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look what makes a good and not so good photo for match photo so we've done a handful of videos that show match photo and how to how that works how to import a file how to line up the lines and everything i'll link to a couple of them down in the comments or the description excuse me when i get this posted but what i really wanted to do was spend a little bit of time looking at some some images that i created some some pictures i took and which ones are good and which ones are not good and how you should go about taking a picture if you want to use it for match photo let's take a look at how that works right now all right so i'm going to import a couple different images uh i'm gonna just just to keep the slate clean i'm going to start a new model for every import just to show you how how it works we're not going to go into actually importing and modeling so much they said i'll link to the files down below or some some videos below that show that process what i want to do is just look at a couple of images and why some of them work and some of them don't so i'm going to go to file import and i'm going to look at the files i have here i took a bunch of pictures and i wanted to look at what does make good so i have this one called ideal that's we're going to end with ideal we're going to go out on a good note we're going to start with this one called bad one and we'll see why i have that so i'm going to go ahead and select it i'm going to make sure i have use as match photo turned on i'm going to import it all right some of you are looking this and going yeah that's not going to work but you would be surprised how many people have images this wanting to know why match photo doesn't work for this so match photo works if you look at these lines see how these lines are disappearing towards the back match photo works by taking the vanishing points and the change of geometry to match your modeling space to this geometry this doesn't have vanishing points we're looking straight at this picture would be great if i wanted to apply it to a model to make it look this building but for match photo i have to see two sides and i have to see vanishing points so this is terrible this is not what you want to have when you look at match photo you definitely want to be seeing something from the side and i want to point out i'm using this i've used this building before it's just a building utility shed that's near where i live it's nice for match photo because it gets rid of slopes and it only has straight lines and very clear-cut easy to see lines um match photo of course works with far more complex building but this is a very clear illustration of how maxed photos should be working so this model it doesn't matter i could move this over to this line i could align my green lines to one side of this building but i can't go any further than that because i can't see the other side so no matter what i do at best i have a surface this won't work for match photo all right let's start a new one and we'll file new you can also just i don't know if everybody knows this but you can start a new match photo from the match photo window by hitting little plus right here same dialogue same thing comes up but let's uh let's grab the next one go ahead and click open all right some of you are looking at this and going i know what's wrong here so the issue here is uh i took several of these pictures with just my iphone and my iphone has two separate lenses on it one is the standard which is what uh the good spoiler alert that's what the good picture is taken with and one of them is a kind of a fisheye a more wide angle so as you look at this you can almost see see how much more exaggerated this this front and back are than over here so it kind of kind of i almost have this swoop that comes up depending on the severity of that swoop depending on how exaggerated the fisheye has made it so you can see here this is not the worst but you can kind of see how this this concrete dips down just a little bit below the straight line this is going to be it it's not going to this i said it's not super exaggerated in this example but i can see same same thing there you can see see the the blue coming through between where my line is and where that concrete is that means that this one is just it won't work out this will i'll get i can get probably get close enough since it's not terribly exaggerated but this fisheye this exaggerated uh zoom is going to cause issues and i'm not going to get a perfect alignment between geometry and the image i'll have these little little gaps this this won't line up perfectly so you want to make sure that when you're using a lens it's not distorting this it's an issue with lenses on small shallow lenses you see on a phone because it doesn't have the big depth between one lens to the next they're very shallow so it's easier to kind of just have a wide lens to get more in it can cause a little bit of an issue so if you see an image this just be conscious that you might be able to make it work but it's not the ideal image for match photo keep going uh one of the questions that always comes up whenever we talk about imagery is what about drone footage well let's look at some drone footage all right so one of the nice things about drones of course is when you get drone footage you get to see the roof right a lot of the images we take from the ground mean we're looking up at the roof so depending drone footage actually ends up being no different from standard footage in a lot of ways primarily in that if you're using a camera that is not going to cause distortion drone footage can be awesome depending on the lens if i use use a lens that you know that does squish stuff down it can cause a little more of an issue we can see what this drone foot is looking at from above this works pretty well now there are limitations right because because it is taken from a drone because oh look at the little shadow of the drone because it's from above and looking down i don't get to see stuff it's harder for me to see where the door is i can't actually see the underside of this overhang so i'm guessing a little bit but overall drone footage can be very very useful and can actually make a good match photo if the lens you're taking from is not distorting anything it's keeping everything fairly clean um and it's taken from the right angle this was a directly overhead image it might be a great reference image for a sloped roof right if i was looking straight down on my house i wanted to match the roof great reference photo but not necessarily good match photo this one however turned out pretty good all right let's look at something that's not so good start one another new one and i'm going to import the worst possible scenario maybe not the worst i'm sure there's there's worse than this but uh yeah this is definitely not a good one and we see it a lot so right away when you look at this uh people who are used to 3d modeling will look at this and go what there's definitely an issue here so what happened with this is this was sort of an attempt to use photo editing to create an isometric view so in this case my my lines here here here are pretty close to equal which means the vanishing that photo match relies on isn't going to work so this this kind of thing this is an exaggerated view i mean on this little tiny building i don't know why anybody would go in and do something stupid this other other than myself uh but i only do it to prove a point um this happens all the time with larger buildings people take pictures of skyscrapers tall buildings and when you take a picture from a a sky you know multi-story building a 20 30 story building from below and you look up it it's going to taper upwards so what people will do is they'll use photo editing software to make the sides of the building rather than go towards each other be perfectly straight which kind of pulls them out distorts the geometry looks good in an image of a building but you can see what happens when i bring in here to photo match if i try to align it look at look at this should be vertical that's not even close to vertical because i've i've distorted the geometry as much as i have so i see this a lot uh when pulling stock photos of glamor shots of buildings which makes sense because you know most people who are taking a photo of a famous building and publishing it aren't doing it so you can get a good match photo set up in sketchup i know how rude they're doing it so the the building itself looks good in the picture so it happens a lot and unfortunately it does kind of ruin the ability to use that photo as a match photo see yeah see how this is this is not the way stuff should look all right so let's do one last image here and this is the how to do it right so i'm going to go ahead and import again and i'm going to use this one right here all right so this photo was taken from pretty close to ground so a few feet up from ground level uh it was taken the center of the photo pretty close to the middle is this edge coming towards me this is taken with a lens that does not distort the geometry hardly at all and you can see almost immediately as i'm starting to line this up you can see the vanishing points right so you see how that corner that's near me is much taller this line right here is way bigger than what i have on either side that's the vanishing i'm talking about that's what is super important for match photo that's basically how match photo functions is those vanishing lights you can actually see as i'm putting dragging my my uh points around and you can see how it's setting up my grid to match and align and look at that when i get my when i get my green point my second green point in there you can see how that lines up and this vertical line shows up perfectly you can scale it so it's about the right size this is how a photo should be taken so again not on one side not at an exaggerated uh you know wide angle lens not necessarily high up from above this makes the perfect photo for match photo don't you love when content creators spend the whole time showing you how not to do something and then right at the end they're and then do it right um there's a point for that you know i i guess i don't know this is the way it worked out hopefully that helps if you've ever had a photo come in and you've tried to use match photo and it hasn't worked uh i would be interested to hear if these were the things you ran into or if there was something else let me know if i missed anything if there's any type of photo or type of setup for a picture that causes match photo to not work i would love to hear that tell me in the comments down below uh and if you haven't already please do and maybe even suggest this to somebody else um if you have an idea for a video this let us know about that in the comments too we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
