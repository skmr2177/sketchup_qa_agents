##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson this time around we're going to have a look at the intersect with model command intersect with model is uh one of these tools that's been around with sketchup for actually quite a while and some of the things that you might use it for have been replaced with the solid tools or some of the solid tool uh extensions out there but there are cases where this tool will still intersect geometry in a way that the solid tools wouldn't work and there can be use cases for it otherwise another interesting thing about it is that you should be able to use intersect with model in any version of sketchup web ipad desktop whereas the solid tools aren't always available in every version so pretty interesting stuff and there's um there's some nuances to it that i think are also kind of interesting we're going to have a look at all of that so let's jump in all right um if i extend these shapes something this intersect with model is going to create edges so right for example they don't these things don't work and it would take a lot of work to actually trace out all of these edges which is what we'd want to do if we wanted to cut these shapes out so if i undo that instead i'm going to select all this geometry right click on it and say intersect faces model and it cuts out every place where surfaces intersect and in fact if we look at the x-ray mode it's done that even internally with these arches so let me undo intersect and you can see we're missing all those edges and then once again i'll redo that with x-ray on just to show creating all of those intersecting edges now whereas solid tools you would have uh some of these you know blocks removed entirely intersect with model is just going to create edges it still leaves it to you to decide what you want to keep and what you want to remove um so with that in mind i would probably come in here and say okay well i'm going to select this geometry this geometry this geometry and that delete those and then i will move to the side select these delete those and you can see i accidentally deleted too much so i'm going to undo that again and then finally delete from this side again i did too much undo and i could turn x-ray mode on perhaps to help but that is what i was trying to achieve now that would be very difficult to create again solid tools would do it but it would be difficult to create in another way a couple things to keep in mind when using intersect with model one is this front back faces right the difference between the white and the blue faces you do want to keep if we look at the monochrome mode there's no change here because we've got sort of again this notion of front and back faces i'm going to right click on one of the front faces and say orient faces you will typically have results that have kind of those back bases displayed when using intersect with models so you may want to orient the faces um and align them all in the same way one other thing to keep in mind when using intersect with model and i'm going to undo back to our example here i pulled these faces um pretty pretty far beyond and i did that intentionally because i knew i wanted to delete them when you have geometry intersecting you may want to extend your geometry way out something this and then when you intersect it intersect facebook model that just makes it so much easier to drag easy big selection windows and delete geometry you don't need so keep that in mind you may want to extend your intersecting geometry especially the stuff that you plan to get rid of and say if we were to turn on hidden geometry i'm sorry not hidden geometry x-ray mode that may make it easier to select and delete some of the geometry we don't want to come in right click and say orient faces so they're all the same that's the basics intersect intersect geometry with model let's have a look at some of the more nuanced cases all right so here we have a couple shapes and we just saw if i move one of these into another i could right click on either of these shapes and say intersect faces with model or selection so for example if i move this surface over here and i have that surface and say just the cone selected i could say intersect faces with model which would be everything or with just the selection and you can see it does not intersect with this sphere it only intersected with the cone and the the block we're going to undo that another thing to keep in mind is that if you want the geometry left over so if i intersect these two and delete that and delete that and i've got the leftover geometry from that sphere so you want to keep you know these are in the same context what we're going to look at next is that if you do it with groups you can get some different results than for example this again i might come in and say all right faces so they have all front faces that's intersecting model with selection or with the entire model now over here i'm going to select these i'm going to group them really quick selecting them i'm grouping them this time if i move these together and say intersect model and it's saying intersect spaces with model what's going to happen is that because this group and this group are separate and we were just intersecting from the outside it does create intersecting edges but they're not part of either group so if you want to create just the edges or separate them for some reason you can if those are groups now of course if i want to come in i could come into one of these intersect phases with model and now those edges are part of that group but the sphere if we come in and delete this that was in a different context the sphere was in a different group so it did not leave that as part of the geometry so you have control over what gets left based on the context that you are using keep that in mind um one more thing about context so let's undo that one more time and i'm going to make this cone and i will create a few copies now again you may think that because this is a component if we intersected these that it might affect that but again that's on the outside those edges so what we actually need to do is go into the component and intersect the faces so if i move this over here and let's say i select the sphere i'm going to cut it out go into my component paste it but i'm going to move it sort of over here and you can see that by doing so on these other components the geometry overlaps these components so if i came into and i said okay i'm inside this component i'm going to right click and say intersect faces with model what we'll see is that even though this sphere was not part of it because it was overlapping we intersected the faces with the entire model and so it it uh created those edges too so i'm going to undo that and that's what this final option is if i right click instead and say intersect model with context context is the groups and components are you in the large model context are you inside a group or component so this will eliminate anything that's not part of this component so context now i can delete that sphere but you can see it did not interact with that sphere that was outside so you have a lot of control again because we can right click and say intersect bases with model which is anything that might come in contact with context so just within the group or component or with selection so even within the context i might say i only want you know this object this object and not some other object so i might say intersect bases with selection so you have a lot of options in how you intersect objects so let's look at another thing to keep in mind that's how you use intersect with model um the rest of this is just some tips and tricks for using it effectively let's say we're creating this small part and this is a tip that's useful for me and some other things we've shared it a lot but when you're dealing with small parts and i want to say intersect these together and these together but if i look at the hidden geometry i might be creating some really tiny little edges in here and tiny tiny edges don't tend to work that well sketchup is a kind of architectural scale modeler so instead when i'm working on something very small i will usually take that and either scale it up by a factor of let's say 100 that way i can shrink it back down by a known factor or i will just make it a component then make a copy of the component and scale that up and then you know if i don't have to know exact dimensions it doesn't matter how big i scale it up anything i do here is going to happen down here so here i might come in um and i will ungroup those intersect model delete these surfaces out select and delete these surfaces and erase these edges and so forth and we can continue working on this a couple things to keep in mind here we said we're doing this on this large scale because that just creates good results on our real small version you may sometimes i copy this object off to the side the one we just used and instead i'm going to scale it up sometimes and this is one of those things you can't do with uh let's say the solid tools sometimes i'm going to flip this you may just want to create some intersecting edges to paint something differently so if i go into this geometry i'm going to group it again and say select these spaces and say intersect faces with model this is outside so it did all the intersecting edges and now i can select this move it off to the side and i've created something where maybe i'm just trying to paint this a different color and another aspect of that that can be useful is is this piece so instead let me just again as an arbitrary example move this over here these are two different groups but if i created them carefully i might be able to do something intersect those faces and then create a series of edges that might be difficult to create in another way because now i take that and use something me and create uh you know a me path or some other way so just a lot of flexibility a lot of options that that are available with um intersect with model i want to show one final example so i'm going to erase this one again all of the changes we made happen on our small version our real size version but the scaling things up is is a technique we use a lot and and very useful let's say that and this isn't the best example but just one more example let's say we've got this we want to create this column okay so i've got our basic column and then we want to create the looting for it i think that's what's called it may be the case that we just ungroup everything here right click intersect faces with model depending on the complexity of your geometry it may take a few moments but it does pretty good job and here we go i can start to come in and clean up the geometry and then i may reverse these faces so i need to keep doing that around to the other other ones as well sometimes i'm going to undo that back to back to here where these are all separate you may create geometry that you know takes some effort to clean up so you may want that separate so it is possible i'm going to take this and move make a copy i'll make a copy it let's say 20 feet i'm gonna make two copies this time i'm going to come in just to the column i'm going to right click and say intersect faces with model and then i will select this all deselect the column delete all of the fluting now based on your geometry it may be simpler that you're doing something this where you are breaking out the pieces that you want to intersect together it may or may not again this may not be the the best example but i just want to show it as an option so there was the result of intersecting that geometry and here we're going to do the opposite so i'm going to select deselect the column group all of these together and then i'm going to come in and select these and ungroup them so now i can again right click and say intersect bases with model so they're going to intersect with the column again it could take a few moments but should happen fairly quickly and then and then i can be left over with that geometry now this is kind of an odd case again not necessarily that you would do it this way but if i move that back exactly to 20 feet go into that group and i'm going to reverse those faces if for some reason you wanted these separate we still have them separate or at this point i could select them both ungroup them to merge that geometry together because it overlaps perfectly again that may or may not be something that you find that useful but it just it's possible because intersect with model just gives you a lot of options on the geometry how it gets intersected what geometry is left over so how was that for a whirlwind of um things thrown at you i i i because i'm kind of old school i really using intersect with model i do find it still is useful even though i am a fan of the solid tools and the solid tools would be the case you might use for some of these
