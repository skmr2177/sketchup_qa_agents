Here are the Q&A pairs based on the provided transcript:

**Q1:** What is the purpose of using the Intersect with Model command in SketchUp?
**A1:** The Intersect with Model command is used to create edges by intersecting two or more faces, allowing for the creation of curved profiles along a circular path.

**Q2:** How does the Intersect with Model command differ from solid tools in terms of creating intersecting edges?
**A2:** The Intersect with Model command creates edges that are part of the original model, whereas solid tools may remove or modify parts of the model to create intersecting edges.

**Q3:** Can I control what gets left over when using Intersect with Model?
**A3:** Yes, by selecting specific faces, groups, components, or selections, you can control what geometry is intersected and what remains in the original model.

**Q4:** What happens when I intersect two separate objects that are not part of a group or component?
**A4:** The resulting edges will be separate from both objects, but they may not be part of either object's context.

**Q5:** How do I use Intersect with Model in small-scale models where tiny edges can be problematic?
**A5:** Scaling up the model by a factor of 100 or more can help minimize issues with tiny edges. Alternatively, creating components and making copies can also simplify the process.

**Q6:** Can I create complex intersections using Intersect with Model alone?
**A6:** While Intersect with Model is powerful, it may not always produce the desired results for complex intersections. In such cases, solid tools or other techniques may be necessary.

**Q7:** How do I undo and redo changes made using Intersect with Model in a group or component context?
**A7:** By selecting specific faces, groups, components, or selections, you can control what geometry is intersected and what remains in the original model.
