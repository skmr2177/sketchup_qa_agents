##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: how do i make my sketchup models look better? video id: plvlne5eaz0 playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plvlne5eaz0 uploader: sketchup duration: 944 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:06:48.932290 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , it's and today i'm going to answer that question i keep seeing, which is how do i make my sketchup models look better? [music] could i have come up with a more subjective term than look better? probably not. uh, what i want to do is i want to take a look. i got a couple of gazeos back here. um and just look at why they look different and what i did to take it from one to the other. uh this is going to be specific to things materials and environments uh in an existing model. so we'll talk about things that you could do in the modeling process to make things look different, but i want to be specific about taking something that is already and making it look better. so let's do that. let's talk about it. okay, so here are my two existing models. so this is the model i started with. this is an old gazebo model that i had and uh this is this is many many years old actually. uh it's i want to i want to take this and without changing the model make it look better more this thing over here on the side. so there's a couple things i want to acknowledge before we do anything else. so, this was modeled off of an actual gazebo that was created at an event i went to. i thought it would be fun to sit down in the booth and actually model this thing. uh, so i did and this is what he came up with. it's a quick little model, but it was fun. um, so a couple things i want to point out. so, you will notice that around the outside and the inside, this is not a continuous piece. these are boards that are put together. and this is actually how it was. i believe the the original model was tongue and groove or i can't remember how it's joined, but that was kind of why they made it was to show these these pieces. so, we're going to go with that. we're going to assume that these are each different pieces going around this. uh same thing down here. you see we have materials turning uh using the materials rather than modeling. that's great. so, it's a very light model, too. this is not a this is not a big heavy hefty thing. uh it just doesn't look awesome. it looks it looks a i mean, in the best possible way, it looks a sketchup model. and that's exactly what it is. uh we do have shadows turned on right here. um but we can we can make this look better in sketchup 2025. so one thing we could do, of course, we could do entourage. i could put this on grass. i could put some face me or 3d trees in the background. i could do that kind of stuff. but i want to look at just, you know, modeling in sketchup, just visualization. what could i do here? so, um, yeah, we'll come we'll come talk about the full circle, the final model over here in just a minute. before that, let's let's actually get hands-on and make some of these changes. so, uh, the big thing, the two big things that i will say we're going to play with is new materials, which is that those pbr materials, and then also environments. so, let's start with environments. i'm going to come over here to environments, and i'm going to take uh we'll take this. that's that's in a good environment right here. this one where it's out in the kind of in the woods kind of thing. i that. let's go ahead and turn that on. so immediately something happens, right? so immediately my materials look better than they did because as soon as i put on environments, uh i get this colored light coming in from somewhere. you see it's shining. it's hidden up here. uh it aligns with my shadows. i'm getting some reflections. i got some default properties are automatically placed on this old wood uh material that was on here. um, something i don't , and this bugs me immediately, to the point that i have to fix it, otherwise it will distract me, is this cast shadows on ground. i'm just going to change that real quick. i just do that by going to shadow settings and down here, if this is collapsed, just hit the little button and turn off on ground. so, that'll still cast shadows onto the other geometry. it just won't leave this thing sitting on the ground that. so, um, this is a great start. so in some cases that might be enough. that gives me enough realistic light, enough change in the material that that looks pretty good. even with or without shadows, that looks better. so there are cases where that might be all you need. one thing i'm going to do is uh much as i this skydome of the woods, it looks a peaceful place to hang out and spend time. uh i it kind of detracts from my image actually. so there's a couple things i could do over here. come back into the environments tab and hit edit. one thing i could do is i could play with the exposure of my sky dome. so i could make it brighter. so my model stands out more. i could make it dimmer. so again, same thing. my my model stands out more. if you still want that in the background. the problem really is that this leaf floor and the material i got in here for the wood are really close together. so kind of no matter what i do, that's going to look not perfect. um, if this is one of those situations where i took the picture and this is exactly where it's going to sit, i might try to make it work. but in this case, i think what i really want from here is the lighting. so, i'm just going to turn off use environment skydoome. by leaving use environment as reflections turned on still, i'm still going to get my lighting just as i did before, but this just uh takes away that picture from the background. so, we're talking about again making this model look best possible, not necessarily the surrounding environment. that is an option. that is definitely a way we could do this. all right. so, another thing we could do in here, obviously, i said, we got our environments turned on. the other thing, so if i look at one of these materials, um, let's go to our what's in this. so, i got this material right here. if i double click this, this is an old material. i said, this was imported from, i can't remember, 2022 or something that. uh, and you can see it did automatically give me metalness and roughness. and i could play with this and, you know, change how much uh metalness i want on that wood material. so, fairly down fairly bar far uh roughness. i can turn it up and down a little bit. this is going to kind of make it shiny or not shiny because it doesn't have a bump map or anything that. so, it's going to just kind of change the glossiness of it. so, if i turn that up, it's going to diffuse it a little more and the metal go down. it's going to but it's not going to pick up the grain of the wood no matter what i do. unless i create and import a normal map, that's not going to happen. so, this is kind of will be the best i could get with just this material. but if i was to come in here and let's go grab let's go to wood and grab a different material. um, let's try this. no, that's i always get copy of that. i think that's a flooring material. nope, that's the flooring material. uh, okay, there we go. nah, don't love that. let's try. there we go. i that. it's a little more close to that original cherry kind of look. uh, you can see that material as i put it on there actually has some texture to it. see that? it's actually got some scratches. i can see the wood grain in there. and of course, that can also be edited. so, if i was to come in here and double click that, um, i could change, you know, how much of that normal we want. do we want that really bumping out there? um, and i could, if i wanted to, turn metaless on and get a little bit more exaggerated lighting. i do kind of that even for something metal or for something wood. get a little bit of metaless in there. it's going to give that a little bit darker darkness and brighter brightness. uh kind of a cool option. but yeah, i could play with that. change the direction of the normal, that kind of thing. and this is going to almost just immediately uh bring this to another level. so, i'm going to go ahead and put that same material uh on all four sides. i put on the top. and you see it kind of turned weird. it's a weird shape. so, what i'm going to do is uh just right click on that. i'm going to hit texture position. and i can just use my uh rotate to just spin that material around. i don't want to necessarily rescale it. so, i'm going keep it the same size. and then just get it so the grain's going correct direction on the underside too. all right. there we go. so, with that, so just looking at this piece right here versus the rest, you can kind of see it is shiny. so, it's got, you know, maybe it's outside. it's probably polyurethane. that's that's probably good. i can see how that works. the other thing that uh bites me about old sketchup models makes it less again pretty um is a distinctive feature of sketchup models which is that heavy profile. so each of these pieces on the outside edges is getting this big heavy line and i it a lot for styliz but if i want it to look pretty it's a cover shot that kind of thing i'll probably want to come in here to my styles click on my edges and turn off profiles. so, you can see see how much lighter that just made that. um, i said, i it. it's that distinct sketchup look, but look at that. it just feels lighter and cleaner when i turn those off in this particular model. so, keep going. let's keep going. uh, something else i might do, i said, this was intentional where i did have these brakes and i said, this was was a bunch of small pieces all connected together. this was not one continuous round piece. so, it's supposed to look this. but it doesn't mean i have to maintain these hard boundaries between. so one of the things i can do, i'm going to go into one of these components. close this. i'm going to say view component edit and hide similar components and get rid of the rest of those. and i'm going to leave this. i'm going to select and delete the end piece here, the end here. and then i'm going to grab all my edges on this edge or on this end. and i'm going to go to entity info and i'm going to hide them by clicking the eyeball. same thing over here. grab all these these four, turn them off. and when i do that, it means each of these pieces is going to kind of meld into the next rather than giving me that hard line. so again, maintaining those piece. so one thing i could do is if this is supposed to be a round piece, uh i could model that at a higher number of edges. um that would give me a smooth thing. but actually, i said, i need this separate look that looks. so, look at this. compare this to this piece out here. they're very similar, but you can see the difference between the two. something else i would take a look at in here is this. i think it's supposed to be brass piece at the top. um, i have kind of a yellowy material. and again, if i look in here, this is the material that imported. it did automatically get a metalness and a roughness. so, i could turn this metalenness up so it's super shiny. turn my roughness down. i can make it almost mirror . not almost, that's straight up mirror . and that would be an option. i could put that in there. um, that's not really what i'm looking for, though. what i'm looking for is a good metally material that looks metal. maybe something kind of, i don't know, hammered or brushed or something that that looks a realistic piece of brass i would see outside. so, i could play with these dials and get it a little bit closer to what i want, or i could use one of the new material. so, i'm going to do that. let's come in here and let's go to our metal and and grab this brass color and we'll just fill this whole thing with it. all right. so, you can see how that changed. looks it doesn't i was going to say it looks good. it doesn't look good yet, but let's come back in here and let's grab this material. and let's turn that roughness and metalness back on. and you can see, i said, it just has a better uh dispersed texture. i don't know even how to describe it. it looks better. it just looks better. um, so we keep metalness up and start dragging our roughness down until it gets about to the spot where it's just shiny enough. i don't want to go here all the way to reflection, but i don't want to go here where it's just dull. i want to come somewhere in between where it's a realistic look of a material, a metal material. i think that looks way better. all right, so these are a couple of things i could do. and and i'm not going to do all these. we'll hop back over to the final version in just a second. but uh i would do the same thing. find a better material for the the base. i just used some tile there apparently. um, but one of the other things, one more thing i'm going to say, again, air quoting the words better, how to make this look better, is to do a little more work with the edges. so, if i come in here, back into styles on my edges. uh, i could do things depending on the model, i could turn my edges off. uh, this doesn't look amazing with them off, but you could possibly fine-tune that a little bit. i'm going to keep my edges on. i'm going to do this, though. i'm going to go over to color. i'm going to hit edit the color and use my colors window to choose a dark gray over black. so watch this difference. black gray a little lighter. that's too light. i think that la last one's good by using a light gray rather than the black. it just draws less attention to the line. so they're still there. they still separate the colors. they still define the edges, but it's just not quite as harsh. so going to just a slightly darker dark gray as opposed to black makes a big difference in my opinion. so let's go. let's go. i know this is this is partway transformed, but let's do the the baking show thing. we'll pull the finished product out of the oven. so those were the same things i did. i just did it to all the pieces. so you can see i still have my segmented circle at the bottom. so i go around there and around the top. i have my material up here. i did different material down here. very reflective, but you know, cuz that's cuz that's what a a piece of stone out out sitting outside would look . reflective metal or reflective stone that. but you can see um i have my lighter lines there. my hidden edges between these pieces are all still separate pieces. same down here. it's the same component repeating, but i turn the edges off so everything comes together. and that's just a couple things. if i had done this from the start as i was modeling, it would not have added very much time to the process. this was a quick and dirty model for sure, but you can see how much nicer that looks than that traditional uh just sketchup quick and dirty materials. uh a little bit more life in it as i get those lights and the colors on there. so, there we go. just a uh a a couple tips for making models look better. i said, i know i know better. what is better? look at some somebody's i know we're going to have the , i the way sketchup looks. i would keep it all in white, just ambient occlusion in white. and i agree, that's cool. that absolutely i love that look. you know if you've seen me model live, i model that way almost all the time. but taking advantage of some of the core functionality that's already in sketchup environments and pbr materials lets you go from that to something that looks not photoreal, but just a little bit more deeper. you know, having ambient occlusion on there, having having those materials and the environmental lightings just lets you take that model and go a little bit better. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week, and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly, though, please do leave us a down below. what do you think? did i make it better? did i make it worse? what's your thoughts on this? and do you have some other tips on how you make your sketchup models look the best they possibly can? better yet, better. there's that word better again. here's a better idea. if you have an idea for a good video, let me know that in the comments down below, too. we making these videos a lot, but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
