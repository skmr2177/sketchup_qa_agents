##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: quick and easy door and window openings video id: sieethrmkqk playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sieethrmkqk uploader: sketchup duration: 834 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:07:13.355355 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , i'm and today we're going to take a look at three ways to add door and window openings to your model. [music] so, we did a couple videos talking about taking line work and importing it, making the faces, and then different ways you can take those faces and make them into 3d shapes, um, 3d walls, excuse me, shapes. uh, and then the next step generally is now going in and adding doors and windows. we're not going to focus so much on creating the door and window component. i'm going to work with a pre-made component for a window. and doors are well, we'll talk about doors, too. doors are kind of windows that go all the way to the floor. um, but i do want to talk about different ways to put those openings in and and how you could go about them. and it really a lot of it comes down to how you created the walls. so, we'll talk about that and then we'll look at uh different ways to get those in there. so, let's hop in. all right. so, i'm working off of this same house that uh i started on back in the very beginning of this series. uh and here we have basically i want to put this same window in this wall three times. once here, once here, once here. um these are the three different ways your walls may end up uh as you're working through here. and doing your input. so when i look here, uh this is probably the most common. so you're going about you're drawing your walls and if you are pulling up to 3d we we showed in the previous videos, you'll probably end up with a gap this. if you're pulling along, you'll probably end up with a gap this. there's a possibility that as you're drawing in your walls, you take the extra steps to break actual openings in. so, um you could have this at this point, which is kind of , okay, you're done. but, uh we'll talk about how to handle this. and then the other option you may end up, again, depending on how you're doing your input, you may just pull your wall all the way across an opening, which means you end up with something this and then have to go in and create that opening. so, how do you what do you do in that case? so, let's take a look at these different situations. i said, i'm just going to work with this window right here. so, i have a component. i'm going to put this same exact component in multiple times. so, just to jump to number two, if as i'm inputting it, as i'm walking along, i'm i'm inputting my walls. if i actually go in here and i put a face down, i extrude it up to the sill plate height and i put an opening or or um you know, i put the fill the wall in up here where the header's going to go, then i'm fairly well done. the thing to remember, regardless of what method we use here, is what is the actual opening height that i'm considering? um, and i point this out for a couple reasons. and this is very similar to what i talked about when we talked about how how are you going to draw the walls and that sort of thing. the opening size you actually use is going to change depending on what you're using the model for. just anything else in sketchup, this is a purpose-built model. um, that meaning, is this opening going to be the exact size of the opening that's called out on your plan? is it going to be based on the actual size of the component? am i going to have additional opening size there? considering this is the hole in the framing versus finish. all of that is something that you need to consider as you model. i can't tell you exactly what size opening you need to put in for a 3040 window. that is something you need to know. uh in this case, i'm going to make my opening exactly the size of this window right here. so, that's currently, let's check it out. so, it's uh this is 3t by 4'6. and if i grab this opening or this this window right here, it's going to plop right in there. and there we go. i'm done. i'm good. um, you'll notice right now i am working off raw geometry. that is intentional. that is just so i don't have to hop in and out of stuff. um, i said before in the other model or in the other videos, i would of course keep this all grouped as i go. i'm just doing it loose because uh it's going to speed up this process. i jump in and out. so yeah. so if as i was modeling i took that into consideration, i left the proper opening size, then i can just come along, i can drop my components into those holes and be done. uh the most common thing is this right here. so so this is where i have uh just a break in the wall. the wall stops something a door window shows up here and then the wall picks up on the other side. again, i would say make sure that this width is the width you want. so, we're looking for a 3ftx 4t6 opening. this is 3 ft gap. that's perfect. now, i just have to put my 4'6 in. all right. so, generally speaking, um when you go to put in a series of doors, windows, whatever, uh a lot of them will have very similar measurements. so, they might be different widths as i work across, but on the front of a building, i'm probably going to have a consistent header height. same with interiors. probably most of my doors on the inside have the same header height. so, one of the things that i would recommend doing is getting an inferencing point that i could reference off of. so, in this case, the top of this header is a perfect example. what i could do is i could come over somewhere off to the side and i can draw a vertical line in at whatever that height is. what this makes, the reason i do this is what's what this is going to do is make it real easy to inference off of that and then come over here and put a line across that to break for that head right there. see how quick and easy that was? we've talked in the past about doing things planes you can inference or invisible surfaces or something that. and that's all cool, but it's just easier to so, here's an interior door right here or here. uh, same thing. i can just kind of inference there. come over here. draw across that and i got that height that that quick. so, your call on how you want to actually do this. um, because what you could do, of course, you could come up here and say, "okay, i want to come up 7 foot and then draw that bottom line." however you get it, you just got to have a line there that breaks that. pull it across. and then to get rid of these extra edges, so there's three extra edges. you could come in with erase, erase, spin around, erase, or you just do a quick select this. group select. that's too many. you don't actually want to do that. don't do that for heaven's sakes. the problem with doing a group select that, i just said, means i got this one right here. so, i'd have to deselect that, and that wouldn't be quite as quick or easy to get rid of. but, uh, yeah. so maybe i thought i had a tip there, but maybe just regular erasing is the quickest and easiest. what you can do, you can put all your door and window openings in and then just come along at one time and delete them or use something uh cleanup to join join faces. that'll get rid of a lot of those those edges, that sort of thing. all right. so if i am drawing a door, my opening is done at that point and i can go grab my component and drop it in. if i'm drawing a window, i got to bring the bottom up. and this this is something again, i can do something very similar because i could come up here. i could create an a reference. here's my here's my whatever height that is. that ended up as a weird height there. whatever that height is, i could draw an edge across that. and then same thing i can come here inference up to this or this point come across here draw that across and then so i could do something that too. same same process basically. um the bottom generally again i'm talking in generalities . uh the top is probably going to be very similar across the model where the bottom might step a little bit more more frequently than the top. um so you might have something where you have maybe multiple heights over on the side this where i can just inference them real quickly. the other thing, of course, is if i know if i know exactly how big this opening is, i could always come here, drop down that height, and go across. either way, it's going to get me the opening i want. and then i can pull that across that. all right. the other possibility, i said, this is the most common right there. and you can see that that really, if i have some good inferencing, i'm going to draw another line across here just so i don't lose that snap point. um if i have the right things to inference to, that can go pretty quick to close that up. now, when it comes to what about when i have nothing and i need to put that in, um there's a couple ways you can go about this. so, if i have an opening that repeats, so say i want this twice, i want once here, once here, uh i would probably draw the shape onto the wall. so, again, same thing. maybe inference right here. that's not going to work actually in this case. so, what i'd probably do if i just knew there was a 3x4 and 1/2 window here. here's what i would do. i'd pick a point. i'd come up to whatever my header height is. i can inference off of my my reference point there. or i could type in 7 foot and then just draw my line over 3t down 4' 6 back over here. and then i have this rectangle. now, what i could do is i could find whatever my uh if if i have my plan on the floor and i have a point i can reference to, um, i could use that. the other option, of course, would be to come in here and then maybe draw a quick line or or grab the tape measure and use it to figure out, okay, maybe the center of that is at 18 ft. so, i could go 18t and then move that from the center to that point. and then if i knew my next one was 4 feet over, i could copy that 4 foot. um, the point is keeping this simple geometry and using that to p to out where the holes will be first is a great way to do it. in fact, i've actually done this where i have the same window over in a wall over here. so, i will copy it and paste it and bring it over here and put it over in this wall. and then i can just do a quick vertical adjustment to that same height and then figure out exactly where it goes there. and then once i'm done with that, then i can come in here and i can push pull that through. just snap to the backside. double click and then i have that opening in. this is doing this all of this without any kind of extensions. there are extensions out there that allow you to do things use the window as a cutter or project openings through multiple pieces. this is all based on my walls being a single big group and not having loose geometry. i don't have, you know, my sheathing separate for my framing, that kind of thing. so, if you're in those situations, you may have more uh to consider than just this. but this is with just simple framing shapes, punching holes in there uh repetitively to get those openings in. and again, doors, i didn't do doors because doors are less work because you just don't do that bottom section. um, but yeah, pretty simple, quick native commands to put all that information in there. uh, hopefully that all makes sense and uh hopefully that makes it easy to put doors and windows into your walls. so again, just to call that out, um there is some assumptions here. if you are working off of things where i have a componented wall, where i have my my framing on the inside, sheathing on the outside, um my drywall on the inside, or whatever, all those extra pieces, then you might have to look at something an extension that will punch a hole through all those things at once. generally speaking, uh i think most people at this point will just work off of that mass of the wall. so again, that that mass could be an individual wall, it could be a set of exterior walls, it could be a set of walls of the specific width. however you break it up and group it up or group it out, group it, just group it. no ins or outs. um that's going to let you the the easiest, cleanest way is just going to be punch a hole in those. and that's a couple of options for doing it. i know that was that was a lot of options. um, this is this is the part i always you any of you who watch me, you know, i struggle. there's so many ways to do this stuff and a lot of it comes down to what information do you need? uh, what are you trying to get out of it and and what's the quickest workflow or most efficient workflow for you. so, there's a couple of options. check those out. think about those and uh let me know what you think down in the comments. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly though, more importantly than that, let me know if any of those tips are useful to you. if you
