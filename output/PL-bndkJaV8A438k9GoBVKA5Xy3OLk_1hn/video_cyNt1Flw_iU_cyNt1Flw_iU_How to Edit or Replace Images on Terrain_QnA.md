##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: how to edit or replace images on terrain video id: cynt1flw_iu playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cynt1flw_iu uploader: sketchup duration: 704 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:12:00.597021 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here and today i want to with you a few of my tricks for working with and editing images on top of terrain [music] so when we have images in sketchup first of all um that's something that we should all be used to or have tried once or twice but when you add images on top of train it can get a little bit tricky especially because an image that's been projected on top of a mesh it's essentially more than one image it's an image applied to all these different faces so what happens when you want to go in and make edits i want to with you a few tricks that's going to make that process of editing or replacing images on terrain a little bit easier right now so what i've got here is well first thing i need to do is i need an image and i need some train so i've got my add location tool uh up and running and i've got this kind of cool little peak here and i'm going to go ahead and grab that so i'm going to select a region and i'm going to point out really quick that you have this ability here in at least if you're using more of a recent or later version of sketchup that you can tile the boundaries of images and so tile boundaries now that's kind of important for a reason which i'll show you in just a second because that's going to be the resolution we're going to talk about resolution here usually you want as best resolution as you can but then that's going to come with some trade-offs so let's go ahead and take a look at that i'm just going to import that at the highest resolution that i can get for my little study that i'm going to work on might take a second that's okay and there it is now that is actually just the flat image so i'm going to open up my tag so we can get the terrain and we can get what's called the snapshot or the flat image and by default i'm just going to go since i'm going to make some changes i'm going to unlock both of those they come in locked by default and i to move my flat image a little higher i to keep that up above the terrain and you'll see why i just to work a little bit higher so i've got both of those turned on so what i mean by working with images on terrain i want to give you an example in this case where i this image but i'm going to be honest with you the the i mean i the quality of the image and i just sort of how it sits on the train but the water looks a little bit dark and so i really want to kind of edit it and have a little bit more control over the image itself now this is where it gets tricky this is why i wanted to do this video is if i turn from face style with textures to face style which is called shaded you can see that what's actually happening here is that it's tiling multiple textures and i've also got my colors and model open already so if i sort of select this one right here it's actually bringing up this image so that's sort of the part that's sort of this lower part of the um of the terrain and it's not just the terrain image that shows that's made up of multiple images it's also going to be the snapshot as well so even on the flat version you can see that it's the same we've got these multiple images make up this higher resolution and that gives us higher resolution now so here's what i want to do though i want to edit this now if i go to edit this the challenge is of course is that it's broken up into pieces so i would have to go in and edit each one of these individually now i don't really want to do that but if you turn on your hidden geometry view hidden geometry sometimes it's easier easier to see the lines when i turn the textures off completely you can see that there's an option here which i you know it actually took me kind of a while to i didn't know you could actually do this took me a while once i figured this out i was this is kind of handy and then you can right click it and this option doesn't show up unless you go back to the textured mode so i'm going to go back to shaded with textures because you actually need to be able to see the textures for this and with everything still selected i can right click and a new option comes up and it's called combined textures so if you click combine textures what it's going to do it's going to take all of these moldable textures and combine them into one now if you're worried i'm going to say no i'm going to cancel on this for just a second because if you're worried about the resolution then you may want to say know what i need the highest resolution that's why i tile these images in the first place then you may want to be safe and just say well you know what i'm going to make a copy just as a backup so what i'm going to do is i'm going to keep this one there and you can see that's got my full resolution and then i'm going to come into this second one i'm going to right click this and i'm going to say combine textures and this time i'm going to say yes so do you want to erase the interior edges yes i just want it to be one texture one face and you'll see why because i want to make some edits to just one texture not multiple textures now in this case if i zoomed in here a little bit you can see there's a little bit of pixelation on the plants um so just kind of take us a look at the level of detail if you're zoomed out it looks pretty good but if you zoom way in yeah you'll see that it does pixelate a little bit because of that combining the textures and here's the one that's not that was um before it was combined so just a little bit sharper detail you lose a little bit of information if you do this that's why i thought well maybe i'll keep a backup copy just in case but actually i think right now for me it's more important to have them combined so now when i click my thumbnail or sorry when i click my eyedropper it shows up here in my colors and model as just one image so i can click edit and then when you choose to edit it it's one thing it's going to do is i want to choose edit a second time but before i do that if you haven't done this already i want to point out that under preferences applications you can choose your default image editor in this case i'm using dolby photoshop because i just want to make some color changes so i've already got that selected in this case what i'm going to do is i'm going to do that again i'm going to right click choose edit of the new combined material and then i'm going to come over here and i'm going to choose edit a second time it's going to send it automatically to photoshop for me so that's kind of cool it sent it straight to photoshop now here i'm just going to add a few correction layers in this case i'm not sure i think it's a little dark so i'm going to boost the brightness up just a little bit and then i think the color balance maybe needs a little bit less yellow you tell me i think maybe have maybe a little sorry not red um you know maybe just a little greener a little bluer a little less yellow i think that looks pretty good and lastly i want to really pop the color of the ocean so i'm going to i'm going to deselect the shrub here and i'm just going to try to select i'm trying to select just the water and if i was doing this proper i would spend a little bit more time doing this and i'm doing this pretty quick so in this case what i'm going to do is do one more and i'm just going to boost the saturation of the water up so that it's just nice and it's nice and happy so when i'm happy here i can do two things i can either save this image as and now if i knew i was going to make further edits or i wanted multiple variations i could do a save as and save that to something my desktop or if i know i'm only going to make one edit i can just hold all of my layers here i can just merge them so if you go layer come down if you're familiar with photoshop merge layers so if you're doing corrections as corrective layers as adjustment layers you can just merge it and then in this case what i would do is say file save and once i do that sketchup watch what happens in sketchup there you go it automatically replace the image with the new one i'm going to hide this this is our old one just in case we need it i don't think we do i'm just going to hide it but now i've got my new brighter happier image now here's what i'm going to do i'm going to show you that one more time and i'm going to show you because there's two ways to do this let's undo that let's say i had a photoshop file and i want to make some other changes in this case i'm going to select inverse who knows maybe i just want to come over here and just take the saturation out it's all about the water in this case i want to just pull the saturation out from my rocks i'm just going to do another save as version instead of just merging that and saving it so that sketchup automatically updates i'm just going to save this as a jpeg here to the desktop i'm going to call this terrain black and white and there we go so now i've got a jpeg on my desktop here that's kind of cool thing is if i had multiple versions of this i could just go ahead and sample that again and instead of choosing edit and making the changes straight in photoshop i can just load it from in this case my desktop where i've saved that black and white version so whether you do it straight in photoshop or you load it and you have multiple versions either way it works now once you've got it in here i don't know whether you the black and white or not i'll let you be the judge now the trick is is to get it on top of the train so the first thing you want to do is go into your group so go into your image group that was originally the location snapshot not the location terrain and double check it by going texture projected so what you want to do is make sure that the texture is projected and then from there we can sample this texture and then i would go into this group and it doesn't matter right now if it's made up of multiple images because what i'm doing is i'm going to replace all those multiple images and i'm going to replace it with just one image so i'm just going to grab that one and i'm just going to come in here and if i turn my textures back on and just give it a second and paste and there it is so it didn't auto replace on the terrain and the reason why is because the train was still made up on the multiple images to me it's kind of always nice to work with a flat image first and then you make those adjustments to it you make that edit and when you're ready you bring that down or you pay you just basically sample and then paste onto that lower terrain and that's cool if i don't need that i can just toggle that off and now i'm ready to diagram or i'm ready to do some mapping or whatever it is that i wanted sort of this color or stylized image of my terrain that i thought would be cool for for my study purposes so that's it pretty quick i mean in this case you don't necessarily need to use photoshop but you definitely want to have an image to swap it out with for example if you found a terrain image from a different source and you just thought oh i the satellite image i want to go back in time or i want to hand draw over the top of it to show my notes whatever the process is that you use where you want to bring in a different image or you want to make changes to the images that you have on your terrain this is a great process to use and also i want to think about and to keep in mind because i said it comes at a trade-off you may depending on the size of your area you may have to use that right click combine textures technique or trick and you know you you may lose a little bit of pixels in resolution and ultimately it really just depends on what you're doing with the image and what is more important but either way don't be afraid to get in there make some changes and play around and have some fun make this terrain your own and with that said i will leave you with a big thank you let us know in the comments if you this trick if you've used it if you didn't know the combined textures trick that's relatively new to me and i've been working in sketchup for a long time let us know your feedback in the comments below and we'll make sure to read those and respond so thank you so much see you next time foreign [music]
