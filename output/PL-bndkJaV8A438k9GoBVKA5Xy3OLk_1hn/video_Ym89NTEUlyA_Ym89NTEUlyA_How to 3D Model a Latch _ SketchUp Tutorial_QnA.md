##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- there it's here and today i'm going to show how to use sketchup to model a latch just this one so this came from a viewer request can you please show how to model a latch uh if you that format of how to model a blank and sketchup uh drop a down below hit the thumbs up button and also let us know in the comments which other things you'd to see uh modeled uh the didn't talk about any particular latch but but i chose this uh one because every time i've been face to face with a latch this i really appreciated the sturdiness the security that that latch provides and i thought let's honor it by showing how to model it step by step so let's do it okay so uh you know we have the kind of the base part here this little uh bolt and then we can you know move it along lock it up and uh you know make sure that thing's secure put that little um that little handle thing handle i don't know that little nub down to make sure it's locked in place um so to do this let's start a new file i'm going to say thanks for your help teddy but i think we can get this on our own um start with the rectangle tool i'm going to do a rectangle of 3 in comma 1.5 in let's zoom in to get a better look at that here and then um another one over here which is going to be 1 in comma 1.5 okay um now to get that um sort of rounded edges here we're going to use the two-point arc tool and i do have my key logger on so in the bottom corner it'll show all the keyboard shortcuts that i use but i'll go from the midpoint here and just drag along this edge till i get that tangent and then double click to to cut that corner off and then i'll just double click on the other um corners that need to get rounded there and then in order to get the holes in the right place i'm going to use guide so i'll use the tape measure tool and i'll pull one down / quarter inch from this edge quarter and then this is half half and half um then i'll use the circle tool from one of these intersection points and do a radius of/ 18 in now i'm going to um select that and use the move tool from that intersection point and then i'll use option uh the modifier key i think it's alt on windows and then tap that two times that turns it into the stamp stamp mode and then i can just click on each of these intersection points to get those um those circles in exactly the right spot i don't need those guides anymore so i'll go delete guides and then i can just delete these extra circles as well i'll push pull this up 1/8 and same here and then i'm going to make all of this a group okay so we have uh the bottom uh thing here now let's get this rounded this rounded bit where that bolt goes through so i'll come over to the side here and i'm going to use the line tool i draw in the blue vert ial direction uh 516 why i don't know that's what worked in practice and then i'll just use inferencing to finish off that rectangle i'm going to do a circle from the very center of this so i'll hover over this midpoint and then hold shift to lock in that green and then once i inference this other midpoint i can know i'm drawing exactly from the middle and i'm going to do a radius of 1/8 again i'll offset this circle to the top of that and then i'll use that two-point arc tool again to get that tangent um edge there to get that little curve that's on the the um i don't know what you call that the middle piece um okay so i'll erase that excess geometry i don't need including that middle part and then what i'm going to do is copy this piece using the move with that option um modify fire key and push pull this across to the end of that and this across to the end of this and triple click to select all this geometry and then hold shift and triple click on this to select that right click and make that a group um now is here uh where i'm going to be using solid tools so first i'll go window entity info and also view tool pallet solid tools uh for the most part i'm just going to be using outer shell which is available in every version of sketchup but i will also use uh subtract later which is only part of um any paid subscription all paid versions of sketchup have that so just wanted to call that out to use solid tools you do need that uh your your objects your groups or components are solid and that'll show up in entity info means they're watertight and manifold there's no holes or excess geometry or anything both of these are solid so select them both and then hit outer shell and then that now i just have one continuous piece there um okay so i have that bottom part i just need to kind of cut this section out for that little bolt to move up and down so in order to get that in the right place what i'm going to do is because i want it centered between these two holes here i'll use the line tool just draw a line straight across and then use the rectangle with the option modifier to draw from the center and on that midpoint that way i know it's centered exactly between these two circles i'll draw one that is 1 in comma one4 delete these extra lines and then i'll push pull this up doesn't exactly matter as long as it's higher than the um the top of this piece here and then uh to get that little cutout u shape i'm going to use offset so i'll select this edge this edge and this edge offset uh quarter inch and then i'll push pull this back uh let's see maybe not quite halfway not quite to this midpoint here but a little bit before i think i can actually pull this out a little bit further too okay um i will triple click to select all that connected geometry make that a group because i'm going to i said use solid tools here that is a solid group always good to double check um and then i'm going to move this in the green direction what i'm going to try to do is let's see line it up here i'll move it vertically where it's not you know see it's i don't want it to trim this little bit here but uh just enough that it's sticking out okay that looks good so i have that selected i'll use subtract from the solid tools subtract it from that and then here we have that little uh opening there uh okay let's see so that opening is about an eighth of an inch um actually just to give it a little extra room let's see what it looks with this fold across so it's still kind of securing that bolt in there but it has a little more room to move back and forth yeah that'll work okay um so we have most of this let's get the the bolt in there so in order to get it centered in here i'm just going to draw little sacrificial geometry use the circle tool in the right uh arrow key to make sure it's on the correct plane delete that and then offset this in just a little bit so it has enough play to move up and down that channel there then i'll push pull this to the end of that uh that big one that big piece and make that piece of group okay now for the little uh handle doad bit that locks in place there i'll use let's see i just want to make sure that that's going to slide up and down easily through here so okay um so i'll do a circle with uh radius 116th so that that's about an eighth of an inch or exactly an eighth of an inch and then pull that up a little bit okay and then i'll use the modifier on push pole using option again to create a new face and i'll scale this just want to give it a little two and then push that up again give you a nice big thing to hold on to there okay and then i'll make all this a group and then i'm going to out outer shell with this bolt uh you can see my entity entity info pardon me that the this is not a solid though because when i did that push pull with the modifier right here it created an extra face right in there so i'll go ahead and delete that and then draw one of these lines in order to close that up now this is a solid group and we can use the outer shell command on it um so to move this so it's centered on this thing i could try to grab that exact center you know um intersection that center uh point on that circle but i can't exactly see it so i'll actually use option again uh sorry not option uh command i've been using option so much for uh modifier keys that i want to use that one but so here you can see i can snap exactly to the midpoint of that group and so i'm going to do that in order well actually first let's move it from this midpoint centered here and then this midpoint along the green centered here okay um now i'm going to move it up let's see yeah i just want to make sure that there's nothing popping out the bottom there and it looks oh actually there is a little bit so i'll move it up a little bit more and that looks there's enough room for that to move through so that's good select those two pieces outer shell okay great you we're basically done we have this piece we can move it along lock it in place the kind of annoying part though comes in when you're rotating it into place because you might think you could use the move grips you know these little red grips on here but i'm kind of breaking the laws of physics you know morphing uh solid through solid that's not going to work i could use the rotate tool and kind of you know try to orbit to the right spot and try to find the center of that circle but you can see it's kind of it's not working exactly as i wanted uh and this is where i'm going to use snaps so snaps uh is basically you can add a a custom control point to your grouper component so to do that i'll enter the group i'm actually just gonna hide rest of model so i can see what i'm doing here and then i'll right click and say add snaps you can see my cursor turns into that snaps uh icon there so i'll inference the side of that circle so i can get the center make sure it's in the right plane and then you can add a custom rotation to snap so then if it snaps to another piece it'll rotate to a certain angle i don't need that here so i'll just get that out and then now when i select that piece and use either the move tool you can see i can uh hold that group i can you know there's control points at the corners of that group but then also at that exact snap point as well it shows up as this kind of blue with a blue little lighter circle in uh in the middle so um in order to rotate in into place and make sure we're locked and secure um i'm going to use rotate and then see when i snap to that snap it goes exactly to the point and then i can say ah i feel so much safer now oh i kind of overdid it uh here we go lock that right into place nice i feel secure so if you liked that video um hit the thumbs up down below would you have done it any other way let me know in the comments for sure uh there's so many different ways to do stuff in sketchup so um i'm always down to hear more but if you have other ideas of things you'd to see modeled uh let us know for sure and have a good one
