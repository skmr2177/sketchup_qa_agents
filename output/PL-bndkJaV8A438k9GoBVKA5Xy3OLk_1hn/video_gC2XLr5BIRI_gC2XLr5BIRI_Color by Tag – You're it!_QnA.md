##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: color by tag ‚Äì you're it! video id: gc2xlr5biri playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gc2xlr5biri uploader: sketchup duration: 651 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:16:49.617177 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody this is in this week's level up sketchup video i want to take a deeper dive and explore some of the useful features that color by tag provides [music] so i don't know about you but i use color by tag mode in different ways for different reasons but pretty much all the time and i kind of feel people think about it as if it's something special that you only use it for certain things but i use it pretty much regularly and mostly for model organization but also to do sort of look at material alternatives so i want to kind of explore those two features that you may not already be doing and explain why that's going to help speed up your process and your workflow so let's go ahead and get to it so i've got a little house here i downloaded from the 3d warehouse and it's the materials that were in there weren't good so i just wiped it out and this is for me to kind of think about part of the process when i download stuff from 3d warehouse is i kind of got it and i kind of rebuild it so i really think about almost starting over from scratch a little bit so that's just kind of the context that's why i don't have any materials in this but since we're going to be overriding them anyway maybe that doesn't really matter i'm going to start by expanding my tags panel in order to be able to get to the color by tag feature so if i click these little three tags next to each other or just hover over it you'll see that it says color by tag if i click that right now i just have them all on the same color and that's to sort of prove the point that by default sketchup just kind of assigns random colors you might see a dark green or dark brown but it'll also repeat colors so you might see several blues now that's not really helpful so you can see that i don't know what what's on what because the colors are all the same so the first thing i want to do is whenever i get a model is not only do i re-tag i set up the tags the way that i want them but i also apply these different colors so that i know what's on what tag so for example it doesn't matter in this case what the colors are i'm just going to pick random colors what is important is that the colors are all different from each other i don't want to have um i don't want to have three blacks or three oranges or something that it doesn't matter again in plants i'm making plants green but plants can be purple as long as they differentiate each other so i'm going through here um the wall slats what color have i not used maybe a darker purple and lastly the wall stone which is sort of the main wall color i don't know do i have yellow i don't think so i'm going to go with yellow so it looks funky but that's okay so from here what's really cool about this is that oh you know for my untagged actually i'm going to go ahead and make this this sort of bright pink that's to me this warning color is using this pink and i'll show you why in a second so from here i can look at this and say okay everything's on the right tag wait except for if i look here my concrete color is pink and i can see that some of these embedded components for these window components in the garage did not get carried over did not get caught so right there i can tell that there's a warning saying get this on the glazing tack so i'll go into that component double click in there select the glazing and if you're old school me you can come over here and move it from the concrete to the glazing but let me go ahead and undo that because with the latest versions of sketchup we've got this little great tag tool here so in this case what i'll do is select glaze you'll notice i'm not making it so that my this is not the current layer i'll always keep that as the untagged layer it's just selected and then i can click over here in my tag icon and just click once and again that's really helpful if i need to do five or six or seven things using that little assign tag tool is really helpful i know there's some other things that need to get fixed but for the most part i'm really just looking at it from this front view so that's kind of what i'm focusing on here so i've set up a scene where i've created a style my i've saved my color by tag to a style and there it is i can switch back and forth i can start to assign materials if i want to or i can start to fix the model or add more entourage for example if i come in here and i just want to throw in some people um just to kind of get a sense of the composition or maybe a story that i want to tell one thing here i just dropped those in and by default they should be untagged which is good habit is to keep it untagged until you're ready to tag it in this case i click on my whether i click here up here in my tags or whether i click on my saved scene which has that style all of a sudden that hot pink that sort of hot pink warning says those two things have been left untagged make sure to select both of them and whichever way you want to do it put those onto the right tag and then you'll see that their color changes instantly which is perfect that's exactly the way that i want to use this it helps keep me organized the other thing this does i just drop this in from my library but if you're ever importing things from again from 3d warehouse you're going to find some stray tags come in with it and this is a great way to kind of warn you if that color changes if you're checking it regularly that means that a tag came in with maybe something that you imported so just make sure to get that as soon as you can and to the right tag so if you do rendering too you'll notice that this is a really great process because it tells you what not only what things are tagged but they're tagged by material so that i can go assign my rendering glass to all of this so again if you're rendering or even if you're just if you're not rendering it's just kind of a good habit to get into staying organized and keeping everything on the right tag so that's kind of the primary use and i think that's pretty expected a lot of people know that but one thing i was in a conference and somebody asked me about changing the colors not to colors but materials so the next thing i want to talk about is actually not using solid colors so much now that was easy for me to see very quickly what needed to be reassigned or which was on what tag but this actually also works as a way to override the materials in the model and i say materials as in textures so right now if i go back to my default view i wiped all the textures that came out so in this case i could go in i could go into all these subgroups come in here as you know find um let's see if this is a concrete maybe i'll find um some concrete where's my concrete asphalt and concrete again apply that now up that was only in that group come in apply that now depending on how the model is set up or organized or grouped that could take a little bit of time and you don't want to explode everything because then you're going to lose you know you're going to lose all your groups and things that so again if i want to i can go in and paint everything individually or i can come back to this same color by tag mode but this time under concrete instead of using this kind of random purple color that i assigned i can just click concrete material and click ok and now my concrete and my color override is showing a concrete material so same thing if i want to go to my wall stone now it doesn't have to be stone necessarily it can also be concrete or just and then if i go to my glazing in this case i'd want to come over to glass and mirrors and i could pick any of these colors i'm just going to pick kind of a transparent gray and all of a sudden you can see that that's transparent the next thing i'm just going to finish this up just because i want to make sure that i've done it justice the roof i'm going to come over here to maybe a wood color and click ok just so that i have a dark roof and what else the garage door needs something which is what i'm calling wall slat maybe something nice and light to sort of contrast that and lastly the plant color come over here to landscape materials and find something that looks a nice plant material or vegetation that one looks good and click that and that's really cool because then that way if i want to just check this and say parquet flooring maybe wasn't the best idea for that wood roof i can just click on that roof one again come over here and say well what about a wood deck material that maybe wasn't the right move either so i'm just going to kind of keep trying different things and the nice thing about this is that is that because it's overriding the whole thing it's overwriting everything on that tag so that i don't have to go in and i said go into that group paste that material find out i don't it go in and remove it and repaste it this is maybe a good way to do some really quick material alternatives in this case i'm still not sort of getting the right material on my roof and i'll say you know what that's close enough i'm going to go ahead and go with that so again the default there is no materials assigned to the model itself yet i can start to do that once i've figured it out or i can just overwrite it and using this setting too i've noticed somebody who taught me uh this at a conference they said yeah i use the materials i use this as a template because they use does cabinets a lot so what what he does is he goes in and he assigns all the materials to his model and then whenever he models he just puts everything on the same tags so all every time he brings a new model in it auto assigns materials so i'm not going to do that here because i think you understand the concept if i bring in another model as long as i have the geometry assigned to the same tag names then the materials will automatically populate which i don't know i mean i think that's a pretty cool feature so hopefully those are new two new ways to kind of work with color by tag even if you just don't do the materials override and you know you to apply materials to geometry of course that's kind of the normal way to do it that's the default way to do it maybe the expected way to do it but just using the color by tag feature to double check what came into your model what tag it's on and just kind of reminding you keep things tagged keep things organized as you go it's going to help out a lot so i'm going to stop there i'm going to say don't forget to and again because i say that last because i do read the comments i respond to them let me know if there's another way if you use color by tag differently if there's something that i missed something you didn't know let us know in the comments that helps that feedback helps us make the videos that you want to see so i'm going to leave it there and see you next time [music] thank you
