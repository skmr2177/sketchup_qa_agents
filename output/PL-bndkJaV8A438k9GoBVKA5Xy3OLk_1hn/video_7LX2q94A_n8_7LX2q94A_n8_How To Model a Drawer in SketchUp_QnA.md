##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today we're going to take a look at modeling a drawer this was a request that came up during a live stream we asked if you know what thing should we model and somebody mentioned a drawer we've talked about we've done a couple videos in the past where we've done you know doveet tails and how to model pieces of wood that fit together but we've never done a comprehensive thing this so um it's going to go a little bit quick so if you want to go into more det detail on the doveet taals or individual pieces i recommend checking those out on our youtube page otherwise we're going hop in model drawer all right so here's here's the thing we're going to model so uh it's uh we got a bottom right here and then the four pieces that make out the uh outside of the drawer and then a front piece on here so we're going to model all that out of these two things these are just rectangles that's right i drew rectangles so i drew a rectangle and this is i think a e8 inch uh tall rectangle right here yeah and then over here i think i have a/ inch piece yeah and then that is what four inches tall something that okay there we go pretty simple so first thing we're going to do is we're going to take this piece right here and we're going to cut a groove for this to go into so i'm going to come into context i'm going to come in here i'm going to come up i don't know an eth of an inch 316 something that i'm going to come in an eighth of an inch up an eighth of an inch so just a 8 in square basically right on the side there and we'll just cut that through there we go so now what that lets me do is let's let's that sit right there so we're going it's moving into that slot right there perfect all right now what we're going to do is we're going to make some doveet tails so the way we're going to do this is we're going to come into the end piece here and i'm going to work i want to evenly divide this into multiple pie pieces i'm going to work off this outside edge rather than the inside edge because the inside edge is now short because i made this cut i could have done this first and cut that afterwards but i didn't so i'm going to select this edge and i'm going to say divide i'm going to divide it to an odd number so we'll say seven segments perfect and then uh yeah i'm going to do this and then what i'll do is i'll come in here and i'll grab this point and i'll drop it down that and then this one will come up there we go and i'll take that and i will option copy it from this point or option move to copy to there and we'll say do that two times there we go now i can do is just take that and i'll push that in we'll push that in 1/2 of one in all three awesome and now we need to do is we need to actually copy that same geometry onto the other side so there's several different ways i could go about this i'm going to do quick and dirty modeling right here so first thing i'm doing is i'm going to come up here i'm going to view i'm going to component edit hide rest of model i don't need to see the rest of everything else in the world as i do this so quick and easy i don't have this set to exact length right now so it's just kind of a piece of wood so i can say grab this option mirror that and just grab that delete it and then we'll go turn edit hide similar components or hide rest model off and then i can grab oops grab the edge of the window and not the uh geometry i want to move going grab this geometry right here and we'll move it back that the same thing here grab that geometry slide it back there we go so now i got that my ends of my drawers are done so i can do now is i can say we'll just mirror again along the middle of this piece of wood right here got those two ends now i need a piece to come out and fill this in now i did not do this very well because if i had been plan planning ahead i would have copied that original piece because uh you can see this piece is not going to work at all but fortunately i'm pretty good at cleaning up my own messes so if i just double click that then i can go there we go cleaned up again um i have in the past teased tyson who does some of our live models for leaving what i call a graveyard of parts and and he always tells me that that's very useful because if you have a graveyard ap parts then you can always go back to a previous piece and uh well i'll be he does seem to be correct all right so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to trace the cutouts that and then i will push those back try gock click this one's being weird because if i hide the rest of my model real quick see what's happening there is because i got that little piece right there so uh i'll have to clean that up this not a big deal pretty easy to fix and i'm going to do the same thing i did before so i'm just going to grab all this geometry i'm going to say mirror it and i'm going to option mirror it right here just select and delete delete those lines in the middle it's going to make it all one piece now if i come back out it's looking pretty good but it's got some issues we got issues so let's start we'll show the rest of the model and i will grab this drop this back oh perfect so i got good good- looking dovetails right here what i don't have is it's not in the right place right everything is off because that's the that's my bottom and it's poking through and it shouldn't be so uh i found that one way to deal with this kind of stuff is to temporarily turn on x-ray tap x on your keyboard you'll get x-ray up and then i can see exactly where i want this to be i want this to pull back to here there we go now all of our pieces are sitting inside the rail perfect and grab this one mirror that option to the middle of this board right here that looks good of course this is in the wrong spot two now so what i got to do is take this piece and move it how far out are we i bet we're exactly a/ inch away from being where we're supposed to be so let's try that let's pull it out this let's see no 3/4 of an inch obviously all right last step then is to just grab these pieces right here and we can just pull them straight out this and then over here i didn't make this a component that could have saved me some time cuz i' i would have only had to change one and there we go there's the base base part of our drawer the last thing we i stuck on this drawer over here was a a just kind of a a front uh this would be the decorative piece so i can do that same thing here i'm going to hit rectangle and i'm going to hit the draw from center option so on on uh mac that's the option key and i'm going to do is i'm going to find the middle of this bring that over find the middle of this bring that down and there we go and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to draw a rectangle that and pull that out say half an inch then i can pull each of these sides up this quick and easy modeling this is if i don't i mean if i had if i'm working from a set of plans where i have exact measurements obviously this be a little easier uh i'm going to pull that out half an inch on each side click click and then i made kind of a a front here all i did was grabb it and we'll offset uh yeah i'll say 38 of an inch and 38 of an inch again and then i'll grab this piece and i will move it forward so i'm going to pull it out that uh maybe yeah a quarter or something that that just gives me a little bit of relief on the front of the drawer there but there we go there's all the pieces you would need got a nice looking functional drawer all the if i needed to i could actually lay these pieces out and take them into the shop and cut it out and have a perfectly working drawer so i should have started with this but there are of course dozens of ways to build something a drawer it's not a one anddone thing this is absolutely something people can br with you could do pocket hole oh i said the p word pocket holes some people those some don't uh doesn't have to be dovetails you could angle cut and glue and nail there's there's so many different ways to make those four pieces of wood come together this was just a way that i thought of when i saw can you model a drawer and that's what i did uh if you have a different way of doing it i love to hear about that too so leave that down in the comments and let me know uh if there's other ways you would have gone about creating a drawer model uh and maybe we'll pick them and uh show them right here on our channel if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we making these videos a lot remember you them more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
