##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: there's a keyboard shortcut for that! video id: jzglkhgepza playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today i want to with you how to use and create custom keyboard shortcuts in order to speed up your workflow here in [applause] sketchup so if you're not already doing it using keyboard shortcuts is a great way to be efficient while modeling what it does is it frees up just that uh split second that it takes to find an icon or a tool from a drop- down menu and allows you to do it instantly by just tapping a key where your hands are naturally resting anyway so there's a couple different ways to do that um we're going to go over both using default shortcuts so ones that are already there for our basic drawing tools but also how to take it a step further and create your own custom shortcuts and of course i'm going to with you my favorite ones and why so let's get to it so here i am in sketchup i've got my you can see my hand here which is is going to rest on the left side of my keyboard we're going to use that in just a second i've also got on the screen you can see when i type a key it shows up on the screen so not only are you seeing what i'm doing with my hands but you can see how it shows up on the screen so first thing i want to do before i get rid of our trusty little toolbar here i want to show you that if you don't already know about keyboard shortcuts if you hover over one for example the circle tool it says c for circle and then if you come over here here and you hover over one you might see e for erase so for example if you're used to just finding the circle tool and clicking on it there you go there's your circle now the same way you can do that hover over it it says c that's telling you that's c on the keyboard so c there's my circle and there you go of course if you've once you memorized all the basic ones you can use go beyond c and go over to p for push pull f for offset p for push pull again select everything and then command or contrl g for group and there you go you can see i've got a little fireplace for my deck and that was done without looking for any tools at all so let's go ahead and just get rid of for now let's just get rid of that toolbar i'm going to i just left that up so that you could see that if you're not sure already what the keyboard shortcuts are you can go ahead and just hover over any of these and it will tell you what they are so don't need that i'm going to delete that um yeah so let's close that out so let's talk about some of these other keyboard shortcuts those are the default ones so your basic tools uh are the drawing tools l for line most of those make sense and so i'm not going to cover those those are pretty basic but i do want to look at some other ones really quick and why why are these ones my favorite i've put a little shortcut list in case i forget here off to the side so the first one i want to look at is paste in place so if you know here that you've got something i've got this lady here i can copy and paste but by default the paste function pastes at the cursor often times i want to copy and then maybe i want to delete and i want to go inside of a group and i want to paste her but i want to paste her not over here and i have to place her but i want to paste her exactly in the same place now normally i would come up here and go up and go edit paste in place but that just takes a little takes my attention away from what i'm doing so i have a keyboard shortcut which is instead of command or control v for paste it's shift v so that's paste in place so i'm going to do that again i'm going to delete her get out of that group shift v paste her right back in place where she was now i that i use that a lot it's one of my favorites paste in place and we're going to look at in a second how to create your own keyboard shortcuts we'll wrap up by actually creating some new ones together in case you're not sure how to do that but let me show you a few more helpful ones and before we um before we wrap up that way uh the other thing is hide now i you can rightclick and say hide uh or you can set a keyboard shortcut for it so i tend to not use keyboard shortcuts for things that i can get on the right click menu so there was a a time where i actually had hide as a keyboard shortcut but i find that if it's in the rightclick menu it's just as fast for me to do it that way so i did want to point out that hide uh is actually in the right click so to me you could set a shortcut for it or you know you can go ahead and hide it that way we're going to have to unhide her in just a second but we'll get there we're going to go down the list so looking around um you can see i'm navigating the model by orbiting but sometimes i want to hold that viewpoint but i want to be able to see the top of my cabin so i'm going to hit shift e and shift e is because i think of it an eyeball so e makes me it easy for me to remember that if i want to use my eye to look around i can hit shift e and what it does is it locks that camera position and so when i move my mouse i'm just uh i'm just looking around from that viewpoint so that's pretty cool why shift it's because e has already been taken by the eraser tool so if i just hit e that's erase i don't want to do that i hit shift e and that shift just reminds me that that's a custom keyboard shortcut that i'm setting up so that one's really helpful zoom extents so speaking of looking around sometimes i'm in my model and i'm you know doing something a little edit down here to this glass and i get stuck and i get i don't know where i am i'm in inside of the model or i'm inside of a wall and i just kind of instead of backing all the way out i can just hit shift z and that's zoom extents so that's zoom zooming zooming all the way out to the extent of the model so another one that i to do is adding scenes shouldn't be that difficult now if you have your scenes panel up you can open up the scenes panel and add one that way but if you have no scenes i have no scenes here so i don't really want to go wind window scenes add a new scene in this case i have a keyboard shortcut for adding scenes it's just shift a and that's so i can remember shift add a scene so there's my scene there it is if i want to do another one i can rotate around and shift a rotate around shift a it's just a really fast way to add scenes it's by using keyboard shortcuts and there they are they're all there that's pretty cool so the next one on my list is hidden geometry that i use all the time so often times especially when you're working with curved surfaces and things where the faces are hidden for example uh if i go and look at these chairs if i wanted to select something or delete a line or hide a line sometimes it's difficult so what i'll hit is j on the keyboard there's no shift on that one because if you think uh sketchup's default shortcut for showing back edges is k so if you wanted to see back edges you could hit k um so i just thought well if i'm going to show my hidden edges i'm just going to do that next to k which is j so i'm seeing my hidden geometry and that looks good so i'm actually happy with those i'll just turn that off hit j again so j is cool because it toggles hidden geometry both on and off so that's hidden geometry speaking of hidden geometry now it's similar to hidden geometry but it's hidden objects if i went in here speaking of hidden objects i have i have a woman here that i hid my scale figure so if i turn my hidden geometry on you can see she doesn't show up she's a group so she's an object so i have n here don't know why n is random just that's what i just assigned was n for hidden objects maybe it was hidden you know n and then i can come over here and right click and say unhide so there she is so she's back so that's pretty cool so hidden objects is n hidden geometry is j maybe if you spelled geometry wrong that's why i use j so that's that one so that takes me to section planes and this is a relatively new one for me i used to always come up here and go tools and i come over section plane and then i go view and i say show section planes and then i go view show a cut that took me a little while so instead i just whenever i have a section i just shift t and shift t for me says toggle i want to toggle my section plane on so there it is it's inside of my group and then when i want to show the section i would hit shift s so shift s shows the section so that's that's why i did an s and that's really cool because while i'm modeling i can always just be turning turning both the plane on or off i wanted to view the plane i could show it or not show it and then if i wanted to show the section i could show it or not show it using just keyboard shortcuts and that one is really one that i picked up recently and i think has really helped me quite a bit i really actually enjoy working with um i didn't mean to move my whole section i meant to go inside my group there we go so i can toggle that turn the plane off see how that looks that looks good so i'll go ahead and turn that section off anyway yeah that one's been tremendously helpful for me so let's see here that takes us pretty much to my last one now there's always more to add there's always tons 's got their own way of working so remember this is just kind of a starting list of things that i find useful for me but um another one is x-ray style i've been this is a new one for me i do use x-ray a lot so i hit x on my keyboard shortcut and that's going to get me x-ray and that's not too difficult to come up here to my toolbar where i could just click the face style myself but again it's just i'm just trying to push myself to use keyboard shortcuts more and more and more so you'll notice when i modeling now when i model i pretty much don't use any of the tools from the large tool palet and other than sometimes where i will you know pick a standard view or change my face style i'll still use those from the tool palette um but for the most part those ones are actually not too difficult for me to get rid of if i wanted to get rid of using those i can do standard views i can shift my camera if i wanted to go to parallel projection i could switch between perspective and parallel projection if i wanted to add a keyboard shortcut for that and flip through my standard views so that's really cool um there's really just almost nothing that you can't turn into a keyboard shortcut so speaking of turning it into let's wrap up by coming over here to preferences hopefully you've stayed with me this long under shortcuts which is third from the bottom in your preferences you can just type something in here so if i wanted to say face style uh let's see i wanted to create a shortcut for hidden line style so this would be a toggling on the hidden line face style so i might come over here and go sh shift h it says actually uh you've already assigned shift h h2 um it's an extension which is hiding edges well i can decide whether i want to keep that for the original shortcut that i created or say no i don't really use that one very often i'm going to replace that one so let's replace that so when i'm in my model i've got a new shortcut shift h and that's hidden line style so again i don't even need to come up here and go view face style uh i don't even know where face style is anymore there it is because i don't use it and i'm hidden line you can see i'm toggling between my hidden line so that is super super super cool and i just love keyboard shortcuts i really hope that um i really hope that this was useful so that's it i encourage this is maybe not something for beginners if you're just starting with sketchup go over to sketchup campus learn the basic tools first um but as soon as you kind of understand the layout how sketchup works go right into starting with keyboard shortcuts trust me it's going to save a lot of time not only
