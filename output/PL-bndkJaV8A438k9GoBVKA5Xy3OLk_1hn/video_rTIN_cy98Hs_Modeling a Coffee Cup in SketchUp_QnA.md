##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: modeling a coffee cup in sketchup video id: rtin_cy98hs playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtin_cy98hs uploader: sketchup duration: 852 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:07:21.574630 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , it's and today we're going to 3d model this coffee cup. [music] i really wanted to do another step-by-step modeling process video. uh, but i couldn't come up with anything good or or there wasn't anything recent that i modeled that made any sense. so, i was looking around. and i saw this and i'm , this is a good opportunity because we can do some some some round shapes. we have some shapes that intersect other shapes. and we even have some me opportunities. so, lots of options on how we could model this. there's actually i could think right off top of my head three different ways to create this cup. so, we're going to hop right in and we're going to model this. i'm not going to put dimensions on. i would just go grab a coffee cup out of your own house and and maybe get yourself a little tape measure, something this, and uh yeah, along with the real thing. don't don't worry about what i'm modeling exactly. get your cup and and you measure and model that thing. okay, let's go. all right, so uh our coffee cup, as most coffee cups tend to be, is based on a circle. so, i'm going to zoom in here. whenever i work on a circle, i to work off the middle of the circle at the origin. this does not actually change anything. it doesn't affect how good the model is, anything that. it's just nice because then i know the middle of my model is on this point, and it just makes it easier to to reference. so, we're going to start with the circle. so, a default circle has 24 sides. i want this to be a little smoother than that. not terribly smooth, but i'm going to go up to 48 sides and hit enter. and then i'm going to drag this out this. so, this is going to be the base of my coffee cup. so based on the quick measurement, my coffee cup is about 3 and 12 in. so since we're drawing the radius, we'd want to put in half of that. so half of 3 is an inch and a half plus a quarter is 1 and 3/4. so i'm going to put 1.75 in and hit enter. all right, there we go. so that's the base of my coffee cup and and based on the size of me coffee cup, that seems about right. um, every once in a while when i have to do that kind of math, i will doubt myself. so, sometimes i'll just draw a quick edge across that and look in the lower right corner and see what is the exact dimension that i just modeled. and it is, in fact, 3 and 12 in. perfect. all right, let's uh let's start making this 3d. so, i said, there's several different ways i could think of doing this. i'm going to do it the way that i'm doing right now. i'm going to grab this and i'm going to offset that up. i'm going to pull that up not a lot, maybe a quarter inch. right? so, whoops. i wrong. let's say offset. i'm sorry. i'm saying offset. i want to push pull. i want to pull that up a quarter inch. it's first thing in the morning and you saw my coffee is still full. so, i apologize. i'm a little off there. now, i'm going to offset this another quarter inch. and then we will bring this up another three and a half inches. all right. so, that gives me a good solid coffee cup shape to begin with. now, a couple things i want to do here. uh, i'm fine with the way this is all looking except my coffee cup has a distinctly rounded over top section right here. it's not it's not flat straight across this. so, what i'm going to do is i'm going to come here and i'm going to draw an edge straight across right there. you see, i did inference so that i was drawing on the red axes. so, this takes this can take a little bit of practice. if you if you try this and you you accidentally end up over here and you don't connect, not a big deal. just disconnect. you want to get to that one right there that is on the right axis. if you flip to the top, sometimes it can be a little easier to see where that is. but, yeah. so, we're going to go straight across with an edge. and then i'm going to draw uh a circle right here. so, i'm going to draw a circle. my circle is going to be upright on the green axis. i'm just going to pull it across that. and then i'm going to for actually first thing i'm going to do if i hit x-ray right now i left half a circle inside the mug. i don't want that. so i want to get rid of it. so i can do it a couple different ways. uh i can hit x-ray and i can erase and swipe right here to get rid of it. the other thing i can do is anytime geometry comes really close to overlapping this. i'll sometimes get a little bit shadow of a line and sometimes i can drag my eraser right by that little tiny shadow and get rid of that piece. that's just kind of a if you're good at uh doing this, you'll get used to to that. see here, i got a little bit of little little chunk of geometry left behind there, too. all right, that was good. so, i'm going i'm just hitting x to toggle x-ray on and off. great way to peek inside a model. i'm going to grab my circle. i'm going to hit me. i added me to my toolbar up here if you don't have it showing up here. it is on the large toolbar if you have it on the side. or if you just go up to tools, you can hit me here also. and i'm going to click this right here. and there we go. so now we got a nice round shape on the top. uh i do have this extra edge. but if i triple click, come over here to soft and smooth edges and just click that. there we go. all soft, all smooth. i'm not going to bump my lip on that nice rounded corner. okay, that looks pretty good. so the only other thing we have the coffee cup's a pretty easy shape. well, i mean, i shouldn't say it's easy. it does have a little little bit of extra geometry here. just this. but the other thing we have is this this uh handle on the side. so, i'm going to model that off to the side. and then we're going to bring them together. so, i'm going to start by grabbing all this and just make it a group. so, not i just want to be able to when i bring my geometry for my handle in, i want to be able to move my handle in and out and figure exactly where it goes before uh merging it. so, i don't want it to accidentally merge beforehand. so, i'm going to draw this on the ground. i'm going to start with a circle. i'm just going to go about that big. again, i just just drew a circle. i'm going to grab it. i'm going to scale it. and i'm going to squish it that. all right. and then i'm going to take this. i'm going to triple click and make it a group. all right. i'm going to take that group now and i'm going to use rotate to get it vertical. so, i want to just come in here and uh i'm going to rotate this along the green axis. flip it up this. and then i'm doing this because now i want to bring it in to put it into my coffee cup. and i'm going to move it upwards. and now i can scale exactly how big it is. so that's what i'm going to do is i'm going to use a me to put geometry on here. so this is the center line. so i do want this smaller than this. i want to go smaller. yeah, something that actually looks better. so, move that down vertically. all right. so, yeah. so, if this was the if i delete the face out of here, you can see just that's the handle. it's going to go a little bit bigger than that. that looks good. i'm going to use that. that's my that is now my handle profile. all right. so, let's let's come in here. i'm going to draw another circle. this one i'm going to draw flat right at this point. and it's going to be, again, i'm just eyeballing stuff at this point because i'm going to deform this. there we go. i'm gonna grab that circle and i'm going to scale that. i want to hit my modifier key to scale about the center. so, uh, if you don't know your modifier key, just look down at the bottom here. i'm on mac, so it says option to toggle about the center. so, i'm going to hit my option key and scale this in that. yeah, that was good. let's try let's try me. i'm going to grab this again. me with this circle. and i will have my handle shape. oops, i i didn't do that right cuz this is since this is in a group, i can't use it as an edge. so, i'm just going to explode it back out. and now i'm going to say me and hit this circle. and there we go. so, now i have that's really close to the shape that i have. so, i'm going to grab all of them and triple click and make it a group. all right. now, i want to make sure i line it up. so, i'm going to go to move, and i want to get the middle uh point on this edge right here. so, you can see when i move over this, i have these these handles i can grab at the corners, but i want the middle of this edge. if i look down at the bottom, uh command, i'm sorry, uh here we go. um command because i'm on mac again. if you're on windows, look on at the command or at the key down there. command's going to cycle through the steps or the spots that i can toggle. there we go. i'm toggle or i'm i'm moving by that middle piece. i'm gonna come over here on the red axis and i'm just going to line it up with you. remember how i talked about keeping this on the origin so i can find the middle point. so if i want to line this right up, i can come under here and i can go right there and i know that now the middle of this is on that green axis. so now as i slide it back this way, as long as i stay on green, i know i'm in line with where i wanted this to be. all right. so there we go. uh, you know, i think it's going to go up just a little. it's a little bit higher. so, i'm going to use my vertical. move it up. all right. that looks pretty good. i don't need this. so, i'm going delete that. all right. so, now here's the thing that's happening. this is lapping into the inside of the cup, which is okay. we this nothing there's no problems right now. but we do want to get rid of the inside. not just here, but we want the inside where this laps inside of here to go away. that geometry should go away. and then we want to merge these two together. so now there's a couple things i could do. i could grab both of these and i could say outer shell and then come in here and manually start chipping away and get rid of this piece. um i could use trim. trim would be an option because trim would leave this piece and this piece separate. so i might be a little easier to clean this off. uh but i'm going to propose something totally different. i'm going to grab both of these. i'm going to rightclick and i am going to intersect faces with selection. that's going to give me some edges that are not actually connected to any of the geometry. okay. so, right now i have here's this piece, here's this piece, and if i move them, you see i have some floating circles right there. that's what i want. i want those floating circles. i only want these two right here specifically. so, i'm going to grab that and that command x to cut it. and i'm going to come into context here and i'm going to go view component edit hide rest of model and i'm going to say edit paste and place. that's going to bring those two circles in and it's going to cut hopefully all this together. so sometimes you'll get this where oh it still says it's all one. if i look around these edges i find a spot where oh it just didn't quite connect right here. let's just draw an edge that. and then with that now this is a separate piece i can delete. nice. so now that meets up where it should. uh i could come over here and just get rid of these all together. delete those. and the last thing i'd want to do is bring these together into one piece. so i'm going to grab both of them. i'm going to explode. and that might be enough. that might actually be enough to intersect this. if i go to x, i might be able to uh swirl my head around inside here and see if there's actually a face on here or not. it looks that face didn't intersect. so, i could do one last intersect. i can grab all this geometry. right click, intersect face with selection. and then that probably gave me probably broke my face now. so, if i peek in here, might be able to get rid oh, it's gone. uh, there we go. all right. um, there we go. we got a coffee cup. i should probably group that again. make group. and i have a coffee cup for face me, . and see again based on the approximate values. that looks about right. that looks pretty good. this is what a scales figure is. this is what a scale figure is for is for looking at stuff this and going, "yeah, that's the right scale." so, there we go. there is my quick and dirty coffee cup. uh if you along, you should have something very similar. so, thanks for uh following along with me. thanks for uh hanging out with me. my morning cup of coffee still. i said a couple steps incorrect but corrected myself is because this is still full. it's not, you know, uh, but let me know what you thought of that video. um, i really making these followalong modeling videos. somebody asked, you know, can you put the final dimension thing up on the screen first? and i that idea, but uh, it's a little more practical sometimes to have to do it yourself. so that's why i kind of push you to go measure your own coffee cup. um, but yeah, let me know how that turned out for you. let me know what your mug looks . if you want to, you can throw it up on our forum in the gallery section and tag me. uh, let me know how that turned out. um, but yeah, i'd to make more of these videos, but i'd love to hear other thoughts of what you think would be good to model. we have 10 to 15 minutes in these videos, so keep that in mind when you ask send in requests. uh, a lot of times people send in requests for very intricate models, and i hate to say that, no, i can't build an entire engine in less than 10 minutes. um, not without speeding it up significantly to the point that you probably wouldn't even understand what happened in that time, but uh, if you do have specific things you want to see see modeled or or that kind of thing, let us know. let us know down in the comments or on the forum and uh, we will take a look at that. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified if you . but i was saying, most importantly, above anything else, leave us a down below. let me know what you thought of this video. let me know if you have other ideas for models we should make or if you have other concepts, ideas, thoughts on things we should make on this series. we making these videos a lot. we them even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
