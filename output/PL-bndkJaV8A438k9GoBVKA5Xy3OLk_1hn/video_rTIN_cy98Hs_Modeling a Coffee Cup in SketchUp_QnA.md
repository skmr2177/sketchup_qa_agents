# Modeling a Coffee Cup in SketchUp

### 1. What are the key modeling techniques demonstrated in this coffee cup tutorial?
**Answer:**
The tutorial demonstrates several important SketchUp techniques:
- **Circle-based modeling**: Creating the cup body from circles
- **Follow Me tool**: Creating rounded edges and handle shapes
- **Intersect Faces**: Combining separate geometry pieces
- **Group management**: Working with groups for complex assemblies
- **Scale and measurement**: Using real-world dimensions

✅ **Key Point**: This tutorial shows how to model organic, curved shapes using SketchUp's geometric tools.

### 2. How do I start modeling the coffee cup body?
**Answer:**
To start the coffee cup body:
- **Work from origin**: Place the center of your circle at the origin point
- **Increase circle segments**: Use 48 sides instead of default 24 for smoother curves
- **Measure accurately**: Use real measurements (e.g., 3.25" diameter = 1.75" radius)
- **Create base circle**: Draw the bottom circle of the cup
- **Verify dimensions**: Check measurements in the lower right corner

⚠️ **Tip**: Working from the origin makes it easier to reference and align other parts later.

### 3. How do I create the cup's cylindrical shape?
**Answer:**
To create the cylindrical shape:
- **Push/Pull the base**: Extrude the bottom circle upward
- **Create offset levels**: Use offset tool to create different diameter levels
- **Build in sections**: Create the base, middle, and top sections separately
- **Add height**: Extrude to about 3.5 inches for a typical coffee cup
- **Maintain proportions**: Keep the cup shape realistic

✅ **Method**: Base circle → Push/pull → Offset → Push/pull → Continue building height.

## Creating the Rounded Top Edge

### 4. How do I create the rounded top edge of the coffee cup?
**Answer:**
To create the rounded top edge:
- **Draw horizontal line**: Create an edge across the top of the cup
- **Use inferencing**: Draw on the red axis for proper alignment
- **Create profile circle**: Draw a circle on the green axis for the rounded edge
- **Use Follow Me tool**: Follow the circle along the top edge path
- **Clean up geometry**: Remove unwanted internal geometry

✅ **Pro Tip**: Use X-ray mode to see and remove internal geometry that shouldn't be there.

### 5. How do I handle internal geometry when creating rounded edges?
**Answer:**
To handle internal geometry:
- **Use X-ray mode**: Toggle X-ray to see inside the model
- **Erase unwanted parts**: Remove internal geometry that shouldn't be there
- **Check for artifacts**: Look for small leftover geometry pieces
- **Clean thoroughly**: Ensure only the desired outer surface remains

## Modeling the Handle

### 6. How do I create the coffee cup handle?
**Answer:**
To create the handle:
- **Model separately**: Create the handle away from the main cup
- **Start with circle**: Draw a circle and scale it to create the handle profile
- **Make it a group**: Group the handle geometry for easier manipulation
- **Rotate to vertical**: Use rotate tool to orient the handle properly
- **Position carefully**: Move the handle to the correct location on the cup

✅ **Best Practice**: Model complex parts separately, then combine them later.

### 7. How do I shape the handle profile?
**Answer:**
To shape the handle profile:
- **Draw base circle**: Start with a circle of appropriate size
- **Scale and deform**: Use scale tool to squish and shape the circle
- **Create center line**: Draw a path for the handle to follow
- **Use Follow Me tool**: Follow the profile along the center line
- **Adjust proportions**: Scale the handle to match the cup size

⚠️ **Tip**: The handle profile should be smaller than the cup diameter for realistic proportions.

### 8. How do I position the handle on the cup?
**Answer:**
To position the handle:
- **Use move tool**: Position the handle group near the cup
- **Align with center**: Use the origin point to align the handle
- **Stay on axis**: Keep the handle aligned with the green axis
- **Adjust height**: Move the handle up or down to the correct position
- **Fine-tune placement**: Make final adjustments for perfect alignment

✅ **Alignment Tip**: Use the origin point and axis lines for precise positioning.

## Combining Geometry with Intersect Faces

### 9. How do I combine the handle with the cup body?
**Answer:**
To combine the handle with the cup:
- **Use Intersect Faces**: Right-click and select "Intersect Faces with Selection"
- **Create cutting edges**: This creates edges where the pieces intersect
- **Select cutting geometry**: Choose the edges that will cut through the cup
- **Cut and paste**: Use cut (Ctrl+X) to remove the cutting geometry
- **Paste in context**: Paste the cutting edges into the cup group

✅ **Advanced Technique**: Intersect Faces is powerful for combining complex geometry.

### 10. How do I clean up the intersection between handle and cup?
**Answer:**
To clean up the intersection:
- **Remove internal geometry**: Delete the parts of the handle that go inside the cup
- **Connect faces**: Draw edges to connect the handle to the cup properly
- **Use intersect again**: If needed, run intersect faces again for clean connection
- **Delete unwanted parts**: Remove any leftover geometry
- **Group final result**: Group the completed coffee cup

⚠️ **Important**: The handle should connect seamlessly to the cup without internal geometry.

## Advanced Techniques and Tips

### 11. How do I use the Follow Me tool effectively for curved shapes?
**Answer:**
To use Follow Me effectively:
- **Create profile**: Draw the shape you want to follow a path
- **Draw path**: Create the path the profile should follow
- **Select profile first**: Click on the profile shape
- **Activate Follow Me**: Click the Follow Me tool
- **Click on path**: Click on the path to create the 3D shape

✅ **Pro Tip**: The Follow Me tool is essential for creating curved and organic shapes.

### 12. How do I work with groups when modeling complex objects?
**Answer:**
When working with groups:
- **Create groups early**: Group related geometry together
- **Edit in context**: Use "Edit Component" to work within groups
- **Hide rest of model**: Use "Hide Rest of Model" for cleaner editing
- **Explode when needed**: Explode groups to combine geometry
- **Regroup final result**: Group the completed object

⚠️ **Workflow**: Groups help prevent accidental geometry merging during modeling.

### 13. How do I verify my model's scale and proportions?
**Answer:**
To verify scale and proportions:
- **Use real measurements**: Measure an actual coffee cup for reference
- **Check dimensions**: Use the measurement box to verify sizes
- **Compare visually**: Look at the model compared to real objects
- **Use scale figures**: Add a scale figure to check proportions
- **Test in context**: Place the model in a scene to see how it looks
