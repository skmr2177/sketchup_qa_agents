##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

[music] so, i'm kind of seeing this as maybe the beginning of a a little tiny series on, you know, architectural models, bringing plans or reference uh geometry model stuff into sketchup and turning into a 3d sketchup model. my goal is not to just have a 2d, you know, convert 2d from another program into 2d and sketchup. i do want to get a 3d sketchup model out of what we import, but it's a little more than uh covering all of it is a little more than what would fit in one video. so, this might be two or three videos. uh the first one i want to talk about though is when we get reference images uh or files and import them in a lot of times they come in as just edges or pixels or whatever else. so, i want to talk about that process. let's look at the three top ways to get that imported geometry and turn it into actual sketchup usable modelable sketchup geometry. here we go. all right. so, i did a couple imports right here. um, i don't want to get too i didn't want to do get too caught up on the exact imports because there's a couple ways to get this geometry imported. so, i just kind of wanted to talk about what comes in. this is two different types of imports. one is a vector-based import. so, this is something a dxf or svg or uh dwg, something where you're importing actual geometry. the other is import of an image. this could be a a gif, a jpeg, a tiff, a png, whatever. um, these this this is an option for importing. uh it is possible to, you know, get reference geometry out of either one of these, but we're going to talk real quick about what's best. we're going to go with one of them and talk about the best three ways to turn it into actual geometry for sketchup. so, first let's look at the image. so, when we import an image into sketchup, uh you're asked to first off kind of arbitrarily size it. so, you just drag it out and it shows up. that's because there's not specific uh dimensions that come with an image this. this is literally a bunch of dots. so, if i zoom in here real tight, you can start to see. all right. so, we get to about here, you can start to see see how it's blurry and got different colors of gray and that are those are the pixels that make up this drawing. uh, and that could be scaled to any size pretty much. so when this happens, if this comes in, i do need some specific geometry. i, by the way, i intentionally made these with no dimensions on them. so we can't rely on dimensions. so if we were looking at this, we had to just go off this, this would be very difficult cuz i would have to somehow find, you know, how long is this or how thick is a wall or something that. and then i would have to take it and scale it. the other thing that would happen is when i come in here to actually draw on here, um, because this is a bit map, because it's just a bunch of colored pixels, i can't snap to anything. it doesn't know that this is an end point, it just knows that this is where these darker black boxes kind of run in and then i have some grayish boxes here. it doesn't know that that should be a point that i can snap to right there. so, one of the issues, and this is how big of an issue is is up to you, but uh one of the issues is if i want to draw this wall right here, i have to go here and i have to come up whatever i think that wall width is and then kind of figure out exactly what that wall width is to here to here to create that one piece. i don't have the ability to snap to anything. that is a the probably the biggest downside. i said, it's not too bad if you know or if you have dimensions or you're working, this is just a reference, but you have a set of a hard set of plans. that might not be too big of a deal because you can reference those images while you do that. uh down here, when we import vector line work, it usually comes into scale. the scale could be off because somebody could be working at scale and not have exported the full scale of something, something that. that could happen. but generally speaking, it is going to be full scale. so, if i come here and i draw a line from here to here, it's 5 1/2 in. that is correct. that's how wide that was when i drew it. um, the other thing that's nice about vector images is they have points. so, i can actually go from point to point. i can reference midpoints. um, that's kind of nice. the one thing that should be considered when you import something this, a dxf or something this, is grouping. so, this comes in as one group. if i double click in here and see i get down. i got oh, there's another group. i'm sorry. no, that was the first group. i didn't click into it. i failed that first test. i click into this group. now, what do i got here? okay, i got some edges. but if i come to this door right here, oh, i see that's another group up here. that's just edges. oh, that looks that one's a group. um, if i click into this door, i have more groups. so this is one of the issues that comes with importing uh vector-based stuff is it is possible to get things grouped. not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to consider. given my option between the two, i would prefer vectorbased geometry. so that's what we're going to look at now. so we're going to look at three different ways now to get this into usable geometry because right now, i said, it's a series of segments, line segments, and groups. so first thing i'm do, i'm going to go in one layer. so, i'm going to go into this group. i'm going to grab everything. right click. grab. try that again. grab everything. rightclick and explode. that's going to explode all groups, but it's only going to explode one level. so, if there's anything below that one level, i'm going to rightclick again, explode again. you see, see how some stuff's still highlighted? those are things that are still in groups. so, if i right click again, uh, okay, there's no more explode. so, right now we're down to just raw geometry. that's perfect. i said, we're one group in. that's fine. so, i'm going to make this i'm going to grab this. i'm going to copy this three times because we're going to talk about three ways to do this. 2x gives me three copies. all right. so, way number one. here's here's what i'm going to do. i'm going to go into my styles real quick. and i'm going to change the background color from white to something uh a something kind of fun. light blue. that's nice. look at that. that's pleasant. um because what i could do is i come into this group and what i could do is i could find what i think is a closed shape and draw an edge along it. if it is truly a closed shape, then i'll get a face that will show up right there. so, i could work my way around this building just drawing sections this and having it close. this is this seems monotonous. oh, i got to draw. but if you're checking dimensions as you go, if you're making sure this is all correct, then it's not a bad step to do because you can verify uh that the geometry is what you're expecting it to be. so this is option number one. number one is just kind of come through here, click on each wall uh and then see how they close up. this is also a great way to identify where is their problem. because as i'm doing this, i might go to draw a line this and find that something doesn't close properly because there's geometry missing, something's broken. so, it is a good way to double check the quality of the file you're working on as you create those faces. all right, so that's one way. then then that's this is that's our goal for this video is to get faces in. and then from there, those faces, we could, you know, turn those up into full height walls, that sort of thing. but we want to look at just how to get the faces. okay. so, our second option, we come over here. uh, we're going to try to force this to create a bunch of faces quicker than that, more than one time. so, i'm going to draw a rectangle around this. so, it's still grouped. and now, i'm going to take my group geometry. after i have the rectangle on the ground below it, i'm going to rightclick. i'm going to explode. when it explodes, that new geometry finds that existing geometry. and what i can get in that case is hopefully uh a whole bunch of closed pieces. so, if i go ahead and let's get rid of this edge right here. there you go. you see a lot of those closed up. not perfect. so, i still have a couple spots here where for whatever reason it didn't intersect correctly. uh, so i might have to do a little bit of clean up. um, something else that can sometimes happen is i can grab if i have a group of geometry that didn't, so none of this stuff intersected. sometimes what i can do is i can grab those edges that and i can kind of kind of shift them up and then shift them right back down and then see if that causes it to break. that time it didn't. so i might have to come in and draw some edges to actually break that. so that's possibly what you'll have to do in that case. but uh that will get you closer to those automatic. and again, a lot of this has to do with the quality of the file you import. if you have a file you import and none of the corners quite close up, that sort of thing, that happens all the time, uh, some cad is not super precise, some people draw stuff and they're not real concerned about tying things up. exactly. that can happen. um, the third way is using an extension, right? so, i'm i'm going to show an extension on this. i know this is not beyond desktop, but we're going to use an extension anyhow. uh, an extension from enerott is available on the 3d warehouse is called ener face creator. i can grab this and hit this button. and what it's going to do is going to just go in there and look for any closed loops and then close them up. so you can see all my walls there. some of them are reversed. so some of them i would have to come in here and you know potentially these are face down. so i say reverse face to get my white one up there. or it really wouldn't matter too much because if i if my end goal is to pull these up into space, it won't matter if it's face up or face down because uh when i pull them into 3d, they'll go the right way. but face creator goes through and finds all those closed loops and just makes them into faces. so this is a great way to do it because this is going to hit. in my experience, it's not perfect. uh but it does do a majority of your faces are going to get closed up this way. so there you go. three options. one is face by face drawing edges. one is intersecting my edges with a plane. and then the third option is right here is enter out face creator to quickly and easily create a whole bunch of faces at one time. so you see nothing none of it nothing's perfect. um, i i have i struggle with this a little bit because personally, if i was responsible for taking a file or an image or a set of plans and getting them into sketchup, i would probably prefer to be pretty manual about the process, right? because if at the end of the day, the quality of that model is on me, then i probably want to go through and check those wall segments against the actual plans. i want to go through and make sure that you know what happens a lot of times. revisions get made, that sort of thing happens. and uh a designer or architect will take a 18 ft wall and say, "this is actually 18'6" and just change the dimension to 18'6. should be fine. not a big deal. if you just get some lines and pull them in and you don't have that dimension to check against, it could be a little bit of an issue because you might just go blindly thinking the line's the right line when in fact the intention is for it to be something different based on dimension. so again, this is just me personally. i would rather go through and check each of those dimensions against plan. so i would probably lean towards the the least effective way, which was manually going through and drawing lines to close things up. that's probably how i would go about it. but it's up to you. sometimes these are your own files coming from a different place or an older version or something that. so you might be good with, you know, i can just quickly make these faces and i know they're right. your call. uh, so that was all about just getting those faces created. so now we can move into creating 3d walls, which is what we'll hit next time. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week, and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly, though, leave us a down below. do you have a does do you have something outside of these three that is a better way to create faces? let me know about that. or do you have an issue that you're running into when you have to create plans out of drawings uh or 3d models out of plans? um let me know about that in the comments, too. or if you have another idea that you think would make a good video, leave it down below. we making these videos a lot. we them even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
