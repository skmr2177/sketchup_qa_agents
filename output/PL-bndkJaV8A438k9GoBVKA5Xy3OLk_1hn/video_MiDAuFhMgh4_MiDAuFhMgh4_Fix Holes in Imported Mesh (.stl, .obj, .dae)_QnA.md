##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=midaufhmgh4 uploader: sketchup duration: 648 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:09:38.991771 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at how to repair meshes as they're imported into sketchup so some of this is pretty general information i mean it's it's repairing any mesh me a mesh by the way is a series of interconnected faces often times you know forming some sort of smooth or undulating surface that kind of thing a lot of times this comes into play when you import meshes stl files obj files uh dae files maybe anything that has geometry that gets imported in sketchup a lot of times they can come in with holes in their surfaces and this is a couple of thoughts to think about when repairing those holes let's hop in all right so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to import uh a stl file so i'm going to go to file i'm say import and i'm going to grab uh this rhino head stl file that i have import that and there we go you see this is normal when you import a file um every triangle that makes up this file this an stl file so everything's triangulated but you can see every triangle is uh visible i can see every single one um this is normal so one of the things you can do is you can soften because uh it can be kind of hard to tell i know because i prepared this file that there is i believe three holes in this mesh but it's pretty hard to pick them out right now one of the things i want to do is i do want to talk about this just using straight sketchup right we're not even going to talk about what you could do with extensions there are extensions out there skimp or transmuter that'll help with importing files and there's of course solid inspector that will jump through something this and see where the holes are that kind of thing uh for this let's just let's just talk about using native tools this is level up sketchup not going beyond desktop so so let's uh let's talk about this so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to come in here i'm going to triple click i entered the group when you import a file it does show up in a group so i'm triple click select all the geometry and then i'm going to shoot right over here soft and smooth edges i'm just going to toggle it off and back on and this doesn't actually fix anything so all this does is it smooths the surfaces so it makes it easier to find things look at that triang see that triangle right there that is a hole in the mesh if i tole hidden geometry real quick i can see the triangles that make it up healing this is pretty simple it's as simple as just going draw a line right there and then if i want to i can come in here and smooth those and they disappear just the others so if i was to turn hometry back off there we go so that hole is gone with this you can start to look around and see some of the issues uh and then you know heal them back up in general what i would tell people people looking for holes in their mesh is look for places where the mesh gets dense so if i go back into hidden geometry um if i look at this see where this where in his mouth see bunch of smaller smaller spots right there that's where i can see okay i have some more holes that i could could clean up um but yeah finding those holes the easiest way to do it is to turn hidden geometry off and then spin around and look for spot there's some spots where based on the geometry i'll get i'll get lines this right here this isn't a hole in the mesh this is just some lines that didn't get smooth based on uh the settings that i had when i turned soft and smooth on so that's not necessarily a problem in fact i might even be able to go in and just smooth those lines right out right here if i wanted to um not necessarily something i have to do it looks prettier but if this is being exported to a 3d printer or something that it wouldn't matter if these are smooth they're not just something i might do for my own beautification making it look nice um yeah so that's an option but yeah it's pretty easy to to get that cleaned up um i do have some other holes in here right down here i can see i have some a non-triangular hole my other holes were all triangular so drawing one line across the edge of a triangle closes it up if i turn i found this turn my hidden geometry back on if i have something whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa got a little crazy there little crazy all right there we go so if i have something this it's non-triangular see this this hole is one two three four edges the way to close that up is going to be just draw a line right across that because that creates two triangles so depending on the geometry there's a chance i might be able to draw a line on one side it close it up but if it's something this that line's probably needed there to create that that triangle to close that geometry up uh i have one more up here and again this point i'm just i'm just navigating to what i already know is here but you would go about this by looking around or again using solid inspectre um so this is a bunch of pieces and this is really this can be hard to clean up if i have my geometry hidden this because it can be kind of hard depending on my view telling where the brakes are i definitely prefer hidden geometry this because i can then i can just come in here and i can knit together my my pieces that and then if i want to again smooth it i can come back in this the reason i would go in and smooth it would be because if i was going through to check everything to make sure it was good i'll probably turn my hidden geometry back off and now i'm just looking for any place again that i have line showing up on my mesh so this of course begs the question well is there a better way to import geometry up here oh no those are all just again little lines i can smooth um is there a way to make geometry come in better answer yes there is all right so i'm just go ahead and start a new file real quick and i'm going to import as is the way to teach i'm going to show you how not to do it first so i can show you how to do it right later so i'm going to go to import and i have this rhino head small and i'm just going to go ahead and import it that's going to come in and you see it's this teeny tiny little little thing maybe it's a piece of jewelry or something that but when i bring this in um i can see whoops i can see right here this got a bunch of tiny holes so this is running into you know tiny surface issue where sketchup while it can maintain it can have models with very small pieces it can't always create small holes or small small faces so these little faces are probably i mean this is probably a fraction of a millimeter i have my my length set to inch and you can tell it's so you see it's approximately equal to zero inches if i come all the way over here we're only looking at a 16th of an inch so these are teeny teeny tiny surfaces and it's not importing into sketchup when i do that so those surfaces are too small for sketchup to draw on import but fortunately there is a simple simple solution to this if i go back to file import i import that same ex exact same file rhino head small i'm going to come here to configure and i'm going to switch my units from millimeters to meters so that says in this file this this is maybe a couple millimeters long it's going to import and make it a couple meters long instead so when i hit okay and import it same exact geometry just a 100 times bigger and when i do that it zoom in on the exact same spot you can see all the spot where i had empty holes before look at that perfectly good smooth geometry no problems there so doing this importing as meters will give you this much bigger file or much bigger surfaces and then all i have to do is once once that's in i can grab this and i can scale it down to point was it 01 and then i can scoot that let's bring that right let bring that right over here and then that geometry then i didn't go quite small enough so scale down 0.1 that should be the same there we go now it's exactly the same size as the other one i imported millimeters but if i come in here look at it of course this one over here has holes in the ears this one doesn't just because i import as a larger unit so sketchup could draw those surfaces then rescaling exact same geometry holes yes holes no so sometimes it's just that simple so i hope that helped you if you're doing a lot of 3d printing or working with other other file file types that kind of thing anything where you're importing geometry on a regular basis you probably are going to run into this sooner or later if you haven't already um i said cleaning it up is really just a matter of finding those holes find the holes draw a couple lines to clean it up if you have big big holes big chunks missing uh that's where you may want to look into maybe it's an issue with the file you're importing uh if you have a bunch of small p pieces missing then you might try importing in a different unit to see if that helps close that up there is a a a garbage in garbage out is a term my dad used to use uh which means you bring in files with missing information sketchup's going to bring that missing information in so it is always a possibility that if you have a file that you're not familiar with you import it's missing faces that those faces may just be missing in the file and in that case you just probably to recreate them or maybe get a different file but uh those are some thoughts on those fixing those meshes i hope that helped uh if you that video click down below and if you haven't already uh please do we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribed most importantly they leave us a down below if you run into issues this do you have a secret that you to use to repair meshes or is there another idea you think think would make a good video let us know in the comments below we making these videos a lot we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank [music] you
