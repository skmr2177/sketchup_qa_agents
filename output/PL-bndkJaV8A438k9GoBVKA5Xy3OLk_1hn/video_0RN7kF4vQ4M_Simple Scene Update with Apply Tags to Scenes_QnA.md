## Enhanced Q&A Generation Agent

### 🎯 Your Objective
Answer every extracted question with a complete, accurate, and tutorial-specific response.

### **Use only the transcript as the primary source.**

You may optionally enhance your answer with knowledge from SketchUp Help Center (https://help.sketchup.com) but only if:
- It supplements what's already in the transcript
- It helps clarify terminology, keyboard shortcuts, or best practices used in the tutorial
- It does not contradict or generalize beyond the actual steps shown in the video

### ## 🧾 Input
Extract from transcripts

## 🧠 Instructions
For each question:

1. **Locate the relevant answer in the transcript**
2. **Only answer if the transcript actually covers the topic**
3. **Be honest: say "This topic is not covered in this tutorial" if needed**
4. **Answer in a clear, actionable, and specific way:**
   - Include the tool/method used
   - Describe on-screen steps or UI interactions
   - **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
   - **Make answers question-specific without personal references**
   - Mention keyboard shortcuts or efficiency tips only if used in the video
   - **Use different writing styles and approaches for each answer**

5. **Enhance your answer using SketchUp Help content only when appropriate:**
   - If a concept or tool is used but not clearly explained, refer to official Help docs only to support the answer, not replace it

6. **Ensure answer uniqueness:**
   - **Never repeat the same explanation pattern** across different questions
   - **Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure** for each answer
   - **Use different examples and references** from the transcript for each question
   - **Make each answer feel distinct and original**

## 🚫 Strict Don'ts
❌ Don't write answers based only on Help documentation
❌ Don't fabricate features or workflows not shown in the video
❌ Don't use copy-paste boilerplate answers across different tutorials
❌ Don't make up steps that aren't visible in the transcript
❌ Don't repeat the same answer structure or content for different questions
❌ Don't use generic templates that could apply to multiple questions
❌ Don't copy-paste similar explanations across different Q&A pairs
❌ **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
❌ **Don't use phrases like "the instructor shows" or "Aaron demonstrates"**
❌ **Don't use phrases like "the tutorial shows" or "this video demonstrates"**
❌ **Don't reference who is teaching or presenting the content**
❌ **Don't use personal pronouns referring to the instructor**
❌ **Don't use "I", "my", "me" or any first-person references**
❌ **Don't mention who created or presented the tutorial**
❌ **Don't reference the speaker or presenter in any way**

## ✅ Output
For each question, provide:
- A full answer grounded in the tutorial transcript
- Supplemented (if helpful) with clarifying info from SketchUp Help Docs
- **Question-specific answers without personal references**
- **Generic, content-focused language that doesn't reference who taught it**
- **Pure technical descriptions without any personal context**

### Example:
**Q:** How is the Follow Me tool used in this tutorial?
**A:** The Follow Me tool is used to extrude a curved profile along a circular path to create crown molding. The process involves selecting the path first, then clicking the profile. While the tool is used efficiently, it is not explained in detail. According to SketchUp Help, the Follow Me tool works by extruding a face along a preselected path.

### Q: How do you create scenes with tags applied to them?

**A:** To create scenes with tags applied, select the scenes by right-clicking and going to "Select", then apply the desired tags. Next, go to "Scene" > "Apply Tags to Scenes". This will update the tags for all selected scenes. You can also use this feature to quickly switch between different scenes and their respective tags.

### Q: What is the purpose of applying tags to scenes?

**A:** Applying tags to scenes allows you to control visibility, create scenes off of a tag, and easily switch between scenes based on their corresponding tags.

### Q: How do you update the status of multiple tags in one go?

**A:** To update the status of multiple tags in one go, select all the relevant tags by right-clicking on them. Then, select the scenes to which these tags are applied by right-clicking and going to "Select". Finally, right-click on the selected scenes and choose "Apply Tags to Scenes".

### Q: Can you import geometry from an existing model and update its tags automatically?

**A:** Yes, you can import geometry from an existing model and update its tags using the "Apply Tags to Scenes" feature. This saves time and effort compared to manually updating each scene individually.
