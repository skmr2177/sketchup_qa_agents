## üéØ Your Objective
Answer every extracted question with a complete, accurate, and tutorial-specific response.

## üßæ Input
Extract from transcripts

## üß† Instructions
For each question:

1. **Locate the relevant answer in the transcript**
2. **Only answer if the transcript actually covers the topic**
3. **Be honest: say "This topic is not covered in this tutorial" if needed**
4. **Answer in a clear, actionable, and specific way:**
   - Include the tool/method used
   - Describe on-screen steps or UI interactions
   - **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
   - **Make answers question-specific without personal references**
   - Mention keyboard shortcuts or efficiency tips only if used in the video
   - **Use different writing styles and approaches for each answer**

5. **Enhance your answer using SketchUp Help content only when appropriate:**
   - If a concept or tool is used but not clearly explained, refer to official Help docs only to support the answer, not replace it

6. **Ensure answer uniqueness:**
   - **Never repeat the same explanation pattern** across different questions
   - **Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure** for each answer
   - **Use different examples and references** from the transcript for each question
   - **Make each answer feel distinct and original**

## ‚úÖ Output
For each question, provide:
- A full answer grounded in the tutorial transcript
- Supplemented (if helpful) with clarifying info from SketchUp Help Docs
- **Question-specific answers without personal references**
- **Generic, content-focused language that doesn't reference who taught it**
- **Pure technical descriptions without any personal context**

### Example:
**Q:** How is the Follow Me tool used in this tutorial?
**A:** The Follow Me tool is not mentioned in the video. The script mentions applying tags to scenes, but it does not provide information about the Follow Me tool.

**Q:** What is Apply Tags To Scenes feature used for?
**A:** The Apply Tags To Scenes feature is used to update the status of multiple scenes with a single action. It allows users to efficiently manage tag visibility and apply changes to all applicable scenes simultaneously.

**Q:** How do I create new tags in SketchUp?
**A:** There is no information provided on how to create new tags in the video transcript. The script mentions applying existing tags, but it does not cover creating new ones.

##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

Below is a transcript that has been pre-cleaned to remove instructor names and personal references. Generate Q&A pairs as per the above instructions. **CRITICAL: The transcript has been cleaned of instructor names. Do not reference any person, instructor, presenter, or speaker. Make questions and answers purely technical and content-focused. Focus entirely on SketchUp techniques, tools, and methods being covered. Use only third-person descriptions of the techniques.**
