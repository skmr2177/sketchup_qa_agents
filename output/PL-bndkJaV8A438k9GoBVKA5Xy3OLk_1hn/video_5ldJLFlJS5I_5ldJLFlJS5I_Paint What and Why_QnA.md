##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm erin and today we're going to talk about the common conceptions or misconceptions or thoughts on painting faces or groups and components so there's actually some pretty uh strong opinions about this topic out there in the world um i want to just talk about how painting on faces versus objects groups and components is different and then we'll talk a little bit more about why that can be an issue and where it can bite you a little bit so let's hop in okay so i'm here in desktop and i have my colors window open over here and my entity info open over here so real quickly real simply i i have this little little super simple house structure i want to keep this simple so you understand exactly what's going on so i have some faces here you see i picked the face it says it's a face it has the default color on there the front and the back white on front and then presumably i can't see inside the gray color on the back but this is i'm just going to go ahead and say nine times out of ten when you're applying colors to your model you should be doing it at this level that means if this is in a group you should double click to enter the group and then come in here to paint if i put red walls on here that green roof click that this is the level you should ideally be uh painting in and you can always use the the modifier keys well look at the bottom there we did a a square one video last year that showed all these different modifier keys how they work check that out if you have any questions but um yeah so basically if you are going to apply materials this is the view to do it from right here just when you're in there where you can go to select and you can pick on a face that's where you should be applying materials now let's take a step over here so right here i have two groups so if i pick on one of them it says they're groups you can see their groups right here um if i grab that same red color i'm in paint bucket and i come click on that same front face look what happens the whole thing turns red and on top of that over here you can see in my entity info it's the info lists this whole group as being read all right now i'm going to double click on this group and i'm going to pick that front face and it tells me the front face is wait a minute it has the default material so this right here what we're looking at right here is the problem that people have when they get a model from somebody else and there's material applied to components rather than faces is it can be very very confusing because what i could do is i can come in here right now grab my blue and apply blue to these two faces so now if i pick one of these faces that's blue that's blue pick the red it's white and i come back out to the outside pick it it says the whole group is red but half of it's blue this is the confusion when you're painting groups and objects instead of faces because what it's telling me is any face that doesn't have a different material applied is going to look red so when i come in here this face with nothing applied is going to get red same here on here i kind of did a material override you could call it and i told it don't use whatever the default material is use blue instead so both faces became blue this is what gets confusing now there are reasons you might want to use this right so here's my my second group totally different group you can see on here i have shingles painted on the roof but nothing on the walls what i could do using this knowing that if i come in here these faces have those shingles applied to them and then the rest of the house doesn't this means what i could do is i could grab a color i could grab green and click anywhere in the group even on the shingled part and it's going to apply any material that does not have another but or any face that does not have another material applied to it is going to get that green so what does my house look if i paint it blue what if i painted my house red and i can go through and visualize this real quick and i don't have to worry about click of facebook and facebook and facebook and facebook facebook instead it's only going to take those so if you're intentional when you create your groups and you put materials on some materials or you put materials on some faces but not others you can end up in a situation this which is you know an easy way to to do that kind of visualization now that doesn't fix the issue so if i come in here and i select this it tells me everything's pink but obviously everything's not pink because i'm looking at shingles right here and here i go inside it tells me this is white because the face itself is white but it's deferring to the color of the object the group on the outside whereas this face has this material applied to it so it's not taking the color of the material of the group it's kind of there's a hierarchy right so with a group any face that is not have something applied it's going to use whatever the group color is any face where it's specifically applied it's going to use that instead so this can be confusing this is where people run into problems especially if you're sharing models if i'm going to take my model pass to somebody else and i give this to them and they're wait a minute this is red that could be confusing so generally speaking we're gonna i'm just going to keep panning back over here this is the ideal way to do it is to paint faces and then at some point i can triple click make this a group if i make it a group it's going to tell me there's no colors applied but if i come in each face has its own color so this is is generally speaking the safest way to apply colors now we've talked about faces we've talked about groups what about components well this adds a whole another wrinkle right components are connected together so any change i make to one of these is going to apply to all of them that's just how component works that's not part of this lesson that's just explanation same goes with color so if i double click and come in here and i grab this red color to put on the roof all copies of that component are going to get red on the outside now we've talked about this in other videos components will reflect anything that happens inside the container to all instances that's why when i painted red i i double clicked to open i painted red that copied to everything else if i grab the outside of a component component and make a change i scale it it's not going to change the others because i didn't change what was inside same goes for colors so if i grab blue and i apply it to this component this component instance that this one is blue this one over here still white so i grab green and put it on here pink put it on here guess what they're all still the same components but the outside of the component has a different color applied so if i come in here and i change my roof to brown that's going to go across all the copies of the component whereas the color that is painted on the outside still stays separate so again this is a tool you can leverage very similar to how i did it over here with groups it is something else you can leverage but at the same time this can be confusing to other people using the model so again if you're working by yourself and you know you have a system you've got it down you you do this no problem if this is you're working in collaboratively with other people you may trip up on this if nothing else it might be worth just you know coming up with a standard for how you do this but again i'm going to just keep just one last time come over here the ideal way to apply materials is the face because you don't have any issues with the materials showing up different from what they actually are on the face so with that explanation hopefully it's clear but you can see why it's not simple straightforward oh yeah yeah just do this then this it will let you when you start coloring things components and groups it will let you create kind of a mess so it is important to note what you're doing and pay attention again if you're working collaboratively and you work with a partner or something you have a standard way of doing uh colors and materials then you know if that's cool work that out you make a system leverage it awesome but if somebody doesn't know and they look at something they're this says it's white but for whatever reason it's blue that could be a little bit confusing hope you that video if so go ahead click down below if you don't already give us a leave us a message down below because we really hearing your thoughts if you are into something this do you have a solution for how you address this sort of thing leave us a down below if you making these videos a lot but they're them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you thank you [music]
