**Q:** What does Shift + Zoom do?
**A:** Shift + Zoom is a combination of keyboard shortcuts that can be used to change the field of view without moving the camera. When you hold down the Shift key and drag outwards with your mouse, it will pull back and increase the feel of the view. This causes a more severe distortion, stretching everything out, but allows you to see the entire room from a different perspective.

**Q:** How does Zoom work?
**A:** Zoom is used to move in and out of a drawing by clicking and dragging with your mouse. It can also be accessed using the Zoom command on your keyboard (usually Ctrl + Mouse wheel). The downside of using Zoom is that it "ratches" and can make it difficult to achieve precise movements.

**Q:** Is Zoom and field of view the same thing?
**A:** No, Zoom and field of view are related but distinct concepts. Zoom refers specifically to the act of moving in and out of a drawing using a mouse or keyboard, while field of view refers to the amount of degrees that you can see at any given time.

**Q:** Can I use Shift + Zoom to change field of view?

**Q:** Is Shift + Zoom useful for interior design work?
