##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtfopkzaao uploader: sketchup duration: 910 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:10:53.591674 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today we're going to do a little grading refresher by taking a deeper look at sketchup's native sandbox tools so if you're new to grading and terrain it might be a little bit intimidating at first because it's uh it's a little bit more at least complicated to think about maybe not so much to work with than it is to do things objects rectangles triangles squares sort of basic geometry shapes but sketchup's got some really great tools called the sandbox tools that if you're not familiar with this is going to be really helpful for you and even if you are it's probably not a bad idea to brush up just to remind yourself what they are and how powerful they are without the use of going to extensions so let's get to it so i've got a few exercises set up here the first thing i want to do is start from scratch now i'm going to need to load my toolbar so if you don't already have or if you don't work with sandbox tools a lot you can go find it under view tool pallets um by default it's not going to load and then sandbox so it's kind of an independent tool set so in this case i'm going to pretend we don't have any terrain to work with so we've got just a blank surface but we want something maybe it's a concept terrain maybe you want to do a skate park or you want to do some landscape mounds or something that so what we want to do is start with actually creating if if you hover over this second icon down it's called from scratch and from scratch lets you create a grid that you can use to then sculpt so down in the bottom right corner you'll see that it says grid spacing 10 ft so if i kind of started a grid this you can see that that's a little bit it doesn't fit the area that i want to grade because it's uh i'm working in a module of five so what i'll do is i'll just hit escape and when it says grid spacing 10 ft i want a little bit of a tighter grid so i'm going to press 5t so i can actually set this grid spacing here before i set the grid so you want to kind of think about how much detail maybe you want to work with so i'm going to click down and you can see there's my terrain grid or my mesh grid that i'm going to work with now if i turn my hidden geometry on you can see it's not just the squares but they're actually triangles with hidden um middle middle lines so from here what i can do is we can go over to what's called the next one down so underneath from scratch is the smooth tool we want to be actually either in the mesh or we want to explode the mesh for this because we need the raw geometry to be able to work with so i'm going to come over here to smooth and then you can see what it's asking me for is for a radius in the corner so if i type in something 30t you can see that the circle changes and if i type in something 25 ft it changes again so what this is asking me to do it's saying find an area within this terrain click down and hold and pull up and you can see that there's this offset distance so this offset distance that's just telling you how high you're pulling it up so in this case i'm pulling it up to 6 feet and i'm just kind of manually doing this this isn't meant to be super precise you just click and pull and then click and pull and you're sculpting these mounts if you wanted a little bit more control over what you're sculpting you can pre-select an area first and then use this move tool and then come over here and what you can see what's happening here is that it's selecting it's making sure to start with this selection and then it's grabbing everything around the outside of that so it's kind of a little bit different way to do it if i wanted to just select a different area show you that one more time you can see that what i'm doing is i'm starting with this pre-selected area and then now when i lift that i'm lifting it up from around that zone so just kind of a couple different ways you can work work with the smooth tool from scratch so on that note if you wanted to work with a little bit more detail you can see that it's maybe not it's kind of a low poly terrain if you felt you wanted to sculpt in a little bit more detail to a particular area maybe where you want to put a house or a path you could always come over here where it says add detail and if i click on add detail and then you know for example i'm going to smooth but maybe a smaller area so i'll drop this down to 10 foot for my radius and i wanted to kind of do some precise sculpting so the more detail you have in your um subdivisions or in your terrain the more you can kind of have a smoother looking terrain or a little bit more control so just kind of think about that maybe before you get started and again if you're new to sbox play around with it so you can see the difference lastly when you're all done you can just take the whole thing and if you want to some soften the edges or the c-l planer so that way you get what is just a smooth mesh and in order to see that a little bit better i'm just gna give that a color and that one's done that's that first one is from scratch and smooth let's keep going so another way to work with sandbox tools is what's called from contours so what i'm going to do is i'm going to select everything and because we have contours already i don't need to have a grid i'm going to bypass that and go straight up to where it says from contours so i'm going to click from contours and there it is you can't see it because of the color but i'm going to go ahe and give that a color cuz my background's white and you can see there it is it made a mesh i'm going to move that so you can see that the it's following the exact same shape of those contours if you get this extra little bit at the bottom there's a couple different ways to deal with that if you turn your hidden geometry on view hidden geometry you can come over here and delete those just kind of erase them that it can get a little messy depending on how complicated your edges and terrain are personally i to if i don't care about merging the contours and the mesh you can just explode this and then that'll allow you to delete this in one go or what i can do is just take this bottom contour here copy it go into the train mesh i'm going to edit paste it in place and what it's going to do is it's going to break that bottom edge so that i can double click it and then i'm going to make this a group and delete it so there's that that's from contours super easy if you've got contours just use that you've got a mesh from here we're going to do from edges i'm going to delete that because that's our finished product so from edges what this means is that i have edges to start with i have edges that i want to then fill a terrain in between them so i don't actually have the contours i don't know what the slope is i just know what the bounding box is this is a sidewalk you can see the sidewalk kind of go ramps down and this is a retaining wall for example so it' be maybe planting in between a um at a park or you know in an office building or something that so what i can do is i can grab edges from the geometry the existing geometry in my model so in this case i can grab this edge i can hold shift grab this edge hold shift and grab that edge so that's three edges one for the top of the walk one for the curved walk and one for the flat bottom of the slope walk so i'm going to pop out of that group and i'm going to come over here and paste it in place so now if i hiit this just for example you can see i've got this edge here and that's going to be the inside part of my slope so now i can either draw a straight line if i wanted just to have a straight slope down or i can get a little fancy with it and take something the arc tool and then use the wall use this retaining wall as a reference so i'm drawing straight up or straight down depending whether i want a bio will or if i want to mound and then what i could do is come over here and depending on how i want this i could either make that tangent or whatnot so maybe that's a little high for this area but i'm going to go for it i'm going to triple click to select all of that area all of that bounding box and click from contours so even though i don't have the inner contours i have the outer contours click from contours and there it is again what i'm doing is i'm going to right click hit explode and again i'm going to do that double click group delete method i'm going to turn my sidewalk back on so we can see it and just to make it a little bit easier to see let's go ahead and give this a color and you can see actually there's the slope it's kind of a mound that comes up and there it is so that's pretty cool so again now i'm just taking geometry or drawing geometry using it as a reference and then i'm using from contours to fill in the gaps so let's look at two more tools just to make sure that we round out our sandbox tool set the next one is stamp so what stamp does is it basically asks you a question it says i'm going to do some grading so i want to stamp an object onto a terrain so basically this house i want to put this house down onto this slope but what i'm going to need is some of this terrain is going to need to get cut out and some of this terrain is going to need to get filled so you can see it's sitting inside the slope here so it what stamp does is it kind of tries to guesstimate at the difference of what is cut and what is fill and it creates a flat area for you to set your house or your road or whatever it is that you're building onto i'll give you an example so i'm going to come over here i'm going to find the one that says stamp so it's the the fourth one down and i'm going to select my house cu i'm going to stamp my house onto the terrain and i'm going to click stamp and it's going to ask me for an offset so the offset is that little red preview and it's saying how far do you want to stamp outside of your building footprint so if i said one foot i just wanted this little flat space and then that's it you know as a transition i could do that or if i wanted 10 ft i wanted a big flat area in this case i'm just going to put something 4 foot so i have a walkway or i have a landing that you can step out onto and then i want to um click my terrain and what it's doing is it's asking me whether i want to go up in which case i'm going to fill inside that slope or whether i want to go down in which case i'm going to cut into the hill so usually want to kind of balance it out a little bit you kind of want to balance your cut and fill so maybe i want to come up a little bit you know so that it's nice and flat there but not too much cu then i have to fill all that in so really just depends on what your needs are in this case i'm going to go with that and i'm going to drop that building straight down and you can see that's that 4ot offset so what i meant was is that it kind of creates that's the grade that's the slope or the transition between um where the grading stop stops and starts and then where it touches the building footprint or foundation so kind of cool little thing to know how to do quick way to do that so lastly assuming that i've got my house already placed and i've got it graded nicely and it looks it's doing okay on the slope but then i might want to ask a questions how might i get there so for this i'm going to use the drape tool so this is where anytime you want to take 2d geometry and project the lines not an image but project the lines onto the slope this is what to use the drape tool so i'm going to click down on the terrain and you can see what it did is it projected the lines straight from the flat 2d path onto the 3d terrain now the only challenge with drape tools sometimes if you have really complex terrain or you have a really complex detailed shape it sometimes will miss um a connection point or there might be a break or a gap that it doesn't automatically uh seal or close up in which case you can see that the surfaces are not separate so i want to give this pathway going up my slope a different color but i can't do that so what i would recommend instead sometimes is to extrude your 2d line work so i'm using the push pull tool just to extrude this and then again if you need to bring it down into the slope if it's not already i'm going to copy that i'm going to copy this pathway go into my slope group you don't always have to do this but i'm going to go ahead and do this just to be safe paste in place and the reason why is i can select my slope hold shift and select the pathway and say intersect face faces with selection so if you don't put it inside the group you have to do it with model and that's okay but it might means it's going to intersect with something you don't want it to so i'm going to say intersect with selection and then let's just say i didn't really need this it was just temporary geometry so i delete that and there's my path again but this time i can it i can see that it's separated from the slope so i can give it a different color so even if i was doing it from an angle yes maybe it doesn't work when i'm down at the grade because i actually have to regrade this and i haven't done that yet but you know if i'm looking at it an aerial or something that that actually is useful to have that geometry projected onto the terrain so that's pretty much it i'm going to pull back here and just show you all that we kind of accomplished in such a a short amount of time which is we started from scratch from contours from edges stamped draped and lastly intersected with the model so if it's been a while since you've tried uh sandbox tools or if you're brand new to sketch up and you haven't even attempted to do any grading or terrain i would say give it a go now you know all the basic tools that come with the sandbox tools which comes default with sketchup so it's considered a native tool even though you have to load the pallet separately so let me know what you think what's your experience grading uh do you kind of avoid grading have you never done it do you have somebody else do your grading for you let me know and we'll keep that conversation going in the comments box and i'll also o end by saying really quick that if you want some more grading tips you can see over behind this shoulder here is our landscape and site design course here on sketchup campus so we've got basically all those tips that you just saw with a lot more and we even go into extensions and things that so if you start here with us in youtube play around with sandbox tools and when you're ready to take that next step we'll see you over at sketchup campus so don't forget to let us know what you think and i'll say thank you see you next time
