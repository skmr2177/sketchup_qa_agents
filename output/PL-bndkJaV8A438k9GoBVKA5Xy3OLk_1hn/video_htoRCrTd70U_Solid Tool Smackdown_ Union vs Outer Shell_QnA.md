✅ **Best Use**: When you want a simplified, solid object without internal spaces.

## Comparing Union vs Outer Shell

### 9. What's the main difference between Union and Outer Shell?
**Answer:**
The main difference is:
- **Union**: Preserves interior spaces and internal geometry
- **Outer Shell**: Removes interior spaces and creates only outer surface
- **Union result**: More complex geometry with internal features
- **Outer Shell result**: Simpler geometry with no internal spaces
- **File size**: Union creates larger files, Outer Shell creates smaller files

⚠️ **Key Difference**: Union maintains interior spaces, Outer Shell removes them.

### 10. How do I choose between Union and Outer Shell?
**Answer:**
Choose based on your needs:
- **Use Union if**: You need to maintain interior spaces or voids
- **Use Outer Shell if**: You want a simplified solid object
- **Consider file size**: Union creates larger files, Outer Shell creates smaller files
- **Think about purpose**: What will the final object be used for?
- **Check requirements**: Does your project need internal spaces?

✅ **Decision Guide**: Interior spaces needed = Union, Simple solid needed = Outer Shell.

## Practical Applications

### 11. How do I check the geometry count after using these tools?
**Answer:**
To check geometry count:
- **Select the object**: Click on your solid group
- **Check Entity Info**: Look at the entity count in the Entity Info panel
- **Compare results**: Union typically has more entities than Outer Shell
- **Monitor performance**: Higher entity counts may affect model performance
- **Consider optimization**: Use Outer Shell if you need a lighter model

✅ **Tip**: Entity count helps you understand the complexity of your final object.

### 12. How do I examine the interior of a solid object?
**Answer:**
To examine the interior:
- **Use X-ray mode**: Press X to toggle X-ray view
- **Use Section Planes**: Create section planes to slice through the object
- **Compare results**: Look at Union vs Outer Shell results side by side
- **Check for voids**: Union will show interior spaces, Outer Shell won't
