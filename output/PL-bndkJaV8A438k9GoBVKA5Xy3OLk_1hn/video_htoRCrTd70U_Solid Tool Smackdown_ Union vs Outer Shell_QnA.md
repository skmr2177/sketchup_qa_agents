##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: solid tool smackdown: union vs outer shell video id: htorcrtd70u playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htorcrtd70u uploader: sketchup duration: 563 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:07:05.698814 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , i'm and today we're take a look at some solid tools, specifically union and outer shell. [music] so, this was by request. we actually had a couple people um ask about these specific functions. we've had a lot of questions about solid tools in general come up lately, and i think that's cool because i do think they are underutilized. uh solid tools are great modeling tools, great way to create 3d shapes. you do have to work differently. so, we're going to touch real quickly on solids as we go through this. if you already know solids and just you can fast forward, scrub forward a little bit. but, uh i did want to talk about this because they are two tools that work very similar with one huge difference. and we'll just touch on what that is right now. all right. so, i have here a couple piles of solids. uh, each of these has a cylinder. this this is a copy of the same thing over and over again. so, we'll just zoom in on one. and then each cylinder has these boxes going around it. uh, just kind of a fun shape. uh, each of these, you can see, is in a group. so, if i pick on one, it does tell me that there is a solid group here. it also tells me that there's 24 of these throughout the model. that's that's good to know, but not really essential for what we're doing. there's eight copies around each cylinder, and they're in there. so, if i double click into this one, um, we'll go up to view, component, edit, hide, rest of model. i'm also going to hit oh, there we go. that's fine. um, you can see that that's all this is. this is just basically an extruded rectangle. it's a solid because there's no extra geometry. this is important. it does when when i pick on a group, it has to the geometry all has to be held in one group and that group has to be properly created as a solid. it has to show up as a solid over here. if you're ever curious and you're trying to make solids and they're not showing up as solids, uh, first thing check to make sure you're grouping them because this as loose geometry isn't going to count as a group. it's not going to count as a solid. the other thing to look at, of course, is to look into solid inspector, which is a free extension available through extension warehouse. it's actually part of sketchup for web. um, so use that if you don't have solid group coming up when you pick on your item. all right, having said all that, i'm going to say that what i'm looking for is whatever this piece is, i want it to all be one connected piece. so, there's two different ways i can go about this. uh, if i go up to tools and i go to solid tools, i have this union command. union is how you grow or connect things together. the other options down here, subtract, pull things apart, trim, cut things away. intersect gives you just the overlap and then split does the opposite. it gets rid of the overlap. um, so basically the only one that actually adds things together in here is union. you'll notice that out here outside of solid tools is outer shell. this is a solid tool. um, i think the idea is this is just the most commonly used one. so it's uh it's out here by itself. it stands apart from the rest of solid tools. these are also, of course, all available as a toolbar or as buttons you can add to your own custom toolbar. so, you could use that, too. but, uh, yeah, what we're going to do is we're going to run on one of these, we're going to run union. on one of them, we're going to run out of shell and see the difference. um, so for most solid tools, you end up with a one two uh process. so, with subtract, i would pick one piece and then hit subtract and then hit the second piece. it would cut the first from the second. with both union and outer shell, i can select any number of items. in this case, all nine pieces, my eight boxes plus my cylinder. and then i can go to tools and hit union. and it will join that all together. you can see that when it's done, i'm just going to go out here and just select it. creates a brand new solid group. all right. so, let's do that to this other group over here, but this time we'll run uh outer shell instead. so if i go tools rather than go into union this time just outer shell i'm going to hit that again. it works with all the things selected. i don't have to do in go do one at a time or anything that. and there we go. we get another solid group. so that's great. so what's the difference? why did i do that? why why have two different things? um there's one very important difference and it's a thing i didn't tell you. and let's go back here to this first piece and uh show you what the difference was. so when i look at this, if i turn on x-ray, see that right there? that is an opening inside. this cylinder is hollow and these blocks lap into it. so what does that mean for union versus outer shell? well, here with union, i can see i don't know, something's going on here. i got these things sticking out. and uh i still have my inside. you can see my inside face right there. but i got other stuff going on. not really sure what over here with outer shell. i can see i don't have that. here's what i'm going to do. i am going to turn off x-ray. and we're going to just grab a couple of uh section planes and chop these things up. there's a couple ways to look inside of a model. one is by tapping x on your keyboard and going into x-ray mode. but this, if you're not exactly sure what you're looking at, this can cause more confusion than help. so, one of the things i do to do, i do to use this tool a lot, is to grab that uh section plane tool. and let's just drop one straight on the top. okay. and i'm just going to grab it and move it. we're going to slice right right down to where these pieces come through. and let's take a look at that. so in my original model, each of these different pieces actually was i mean it was separate but you see this this was not just a cylinder was actually a tube. so what happened was outer shell took the outer faces and joined them together to create this solid piece while union honored that there was an opening in the middle and actually let these pieces lap in and created that shape instead. so you can see this is still one solid, one solid. a hole on the side does not make it not a solid. it just means all the pieces connect together and it can will honor that hole inside. so why would you want to do this? why would this be important? well, this this this is it right here. i mean, if for whatever reason this thing i was generating had a void inside of it because this was getting machined or 3d printed or whatever and i needed to maintain that void space, it would be very important to use union rather than outer shell. outer shell is great for taking a bunch of pieces and just kind of it's kind of shrink wrapping or or thermal wrapping the whole thing and just taking the outside faces. everything inside gets thrown away. so if you're ever doing solid work with a building or something that where you want to maintain the inside space and but still make it a solid piece, it's going be very important to use union because you want to make sure you maintain that interior space. so in a nutshell, the difference is maintaining that inside space in there. and outer shell doesn't do that. the nice thing about outershell is if i do run outer shell, if i come in here and i grab everything and it tells me i got 226 entities. this is a pretty small model of course, but if i grab this one, look at this. 500 entities cuz it's keeping all that geometry on the inside. so depending what you're using it for, uh, outer shell is a great way to make a lighter model, less geometry, that sort of thing. uh, but union of course is going to maintain that possibly very important void on the inside of the geometry. so, that was a deep deep dive. we dove we went really really into that. um, but i get this question a lot. so, i wanted to do kind of an ultimate overview of of the difference between the two. uh, we get that question quite a bit saying, well, why would you use this instead of this? well, i just use this. i don't this. i and that's that's cool. that's you do you. you do your thing. that's fine. don't do it the way i do it. do it the way you do it. uh, but it is good to know that because if there is a situation where you're trying to keep that space open on the inside, it's very important to use the right command. um, let me know if you have other questions specific to solid tools. uh, i think there's more and more workflows that i'm seeing popping up using solids and i think it's a great way to work. uh, but i am curious what you have questions about as far as solid tools. so, let me know if you have any other questions about that. and if you this video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly though, i was just saying, leave us a . let me know what you thought of this process. if you use this, if you've ever been bitten by the difference between the two commands, or if there's another solid tool workflow that you have questions about or would to see us talk about, or if there's just some other idea you think would make a good video here. we making these videos a lot, but we them even more than showing something you want to see. thank you.
