##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don’t hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter — the line will snap to that precise length.


✅ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You’ll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp’s way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


⚠️ Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it’s an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry — you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i'm going to show you how to use scenes and tags to make a chasing light animation the one happening right behind me happy holidays so we've said it before on here uh sketchup is not by itself an animation tool it's not the tool you would buy to you know rig characters and make them move or do much more than flying through a scene sketchup is primarily a 3d modeling tool it does have some basic animation though i said using scenes or tags for visibility you can move through a model or make a model pieces of a model you know show up and disappear that kind of thing and we're going to show how to use those things those those things i just mentioned to uh do a quick animation of lights so let's hop in and do it okay so i have a pretty simple setup here i have a little little facade of a house right here and then uh that's not i insulted it you're nothing but a facade of a house um and then i have this string of lights so what we're going to do is we're going to make three copies of this string of lights with different lights lit up on each copy so i'm going to do a couple things here first we're going to create three tags so i'm going to make lights a we'll call them lights i guess it really doesn't matter what i call them i could call them just a for that matter but uh anyhow i'm going to spell lights correctly because because i can well actually sometimes i can't but i'm going to do it i did it i forced myself to all right so i have three uh different tags right here and now i'm going to make three copies of this right here so i'm going to use move um and i'm just going to option copy one over here i'm use this this uh overhang right here as my distance to copy that way i can get it right back to where i need it here and i'm going to make one more copy i don't have to actually copy these out separate to make this work what i'm doing uh it's just a little easier to visualize if i put them out here this all right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to grab this first one this one is going to go to a the second one is going to go to b and this third one is going to go to c all right so now they're all on a different so as i turn these on and off i'll be able to see that i can just see which one i want all right now what i can do is i can actually take these and we're going to scoot them back to where they were i said i really i really only did that to make it easier to visualize as i was making making those three copies but now you believe that there's three copies they're all they're exact same geometry in the exact same place so i can't see them more than one at a time but what i'm going to do now is i'm going to turn off b and c so now i have just lights a all right so now i'm going to double click and let me look at one of these light bulbs so what this light bulb consists of is a simple is just a single single mesh inside this component uh the outs or the tops of these are painted green you can see and the bulb it self is the default material so what that means is if i come in here and i bring up my paint bucket and i grab a gray color a little bit darker and i color this component the green's going to stay green but anything that's the default material will then turn that gray so this makes it real quick and easy to color two leave one color two leave one color two leave one color two leave one etc etc etc so i work across this whole thing uh doing it this and actually it's occurring to me right now that i unintentionally this was not this was honestly not on purpose but i made the perfect number of segments and the perfect number of bulbs that i could have made each of these loops a different component and it would have worked perfectly i didn't think about that but i did that so way to go subconscious awesome modeling eron all right so there we go so now i have gray gray white gray gray white gray gray white all the way across there so i'm going to do now is i'm going to turn off lights a and i'm turn on lights b again going into that in this case i'm going to go the same thing grab my paint bucket leave a white one and then say gray gray white gray gray white gray gray white so i'm going to work my way across here same way just a couple of quick quick quick clicks quick clicks um this idea by the way is something that came out of one of our live modeling sessions we do live modeling every friday well most fridays uh on our youtube facebook and linkedin channels so you should come check us out because we talk about cool stuff and come up with ideas this that we end up making a reality later on all right so now i'm going to take that one turn that off turn on c and then this one i'm going to go put a gray here leave that one white and gray gray gray gray okay and work my way across there so what i should end up with in this case if i've done everything correct which i do believe i have i should have three different versions of gray and light white bulbs and if i flip them on and off quick enough i should see it look i'm moving through here so let's check it out so start with a my third bulb's lit c my first and fourth i'm sorry b c my second and fifth so yeah that looks it's going to be correct so here's what i got to do now now what i need to do is i need a scene connected to each of these tags so with lights a turned on i'm going to say make a new scene that's it actually that's not it i lied i totally lied that's not it at all what is it i want to expand this down i want to make sure with this scene the only thing i keep is visible tags so i'm going to turn off all the these other attributes i don't care about any of this stuff i don't want the scene to remember any of this stuff or force any of it on me all i want it to do is control visibility of tags and then let's update that visible tags only now i'll go from a to b and make a new scene b to c make a new scene and that's it we've done all the work now we just have to play the animation so i'm going to go over to view i'm going to go to animation i'm going to go to settings um i want to turn off scene transitions i usually have that turned off anyhow and i want a fairly quick light chase here so i'm going to do something 0.5 seconds all right and going close that and now i should be able to go to view animation and play and what will happen here is it's just going to go through each scene and you see as each scene one two 3 one two 3 each one's just toggling each tag on and off and because we didn't connect this to anything other than tags we can actually move through the model and the animation keeps going it does pause for a second if i'm you know moving something you know moving the whole model so it has to redraw everything it does take a second to pause there but then as soon as i land again i can see that animation continue so my point is i don't have to do this from one point of view i come over here and get teddy in the foreground keep the animation going i can come down here and look up at it my kid physically and and then uh yeah there we go i got it it's it's animating my lights that's all there's to it so again not a true animation in the sense of i'm not setting values of each of these or moving things in 3d space but an animation in that kind of a cell animation i'm flipping from one view to the next to the next and creating this illusion of chasing lights moving through my model pretty cool so there you go i said that's it's not a complicated process it's actually pretty easy once you know the steps and if you set it all up right there's really a lot of things you can do with simple animations uh inside a sketchup this is kind of a fun one this is i said this came out of a live stream could we make them the lights on on a sign we made blink uh and this is how you'd go about that i thought it' be fun considering the time of year to do holiday lights as opposed to the las vegas sign which is what we were working with originally but process would be the same so i hope you that and if you did that click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos around here each and every week and to be notified of all of them if you most importantly more than anything though leave us a down below is this new to you did you just learn this do you have a different way you would have gone about this or do you have another idea that you think would make a good video leave it in the comments we making these videos a lot but we them even more when sh something you want to see thank you [music]
