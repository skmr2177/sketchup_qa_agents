##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to carve some [music] pumpkins so we've done videos on this if you're a longtime follower of our channel we have done jacko lanterns in the past but it's just such a good learning example um right off time i there's over a dozen different concepts and tools youed native tools that are used uh to make these so it's a great thing to practice if you haven't done this before and you're' seen us for the first time watch this and then go back and do your own and uh yeah let me know how it goes let's do it let's car some jack lanterns all right so first thing i'm going to do is uh i'm going to draw an edge from here up to here just to kind of figure out exactly how tall i want my jack l to be compared to you know a teddy size then i'm going to grab my arc i'm going to go top to bottom and i'm gonna pull that out i'm g to go past a half circle so i get a little bit extra bulge because uh what this is going to be this is the profile of the pumpkin pumpkins kind of do this thing where they they kind of pull back in at the stem and at the you know anti-stem what whatever the this piece is here the bottom of the pumpkin so that's a pretty good shape to begin with i'm going to delete this edge i drew and i'm going to start with a new circle my circle i want to to be parallel to the red axes and it's going to be that big is i'm sorry if these are not accurate enough values i i don't have exact numbers i'm working with i'm work i'm doing organic shapes here you know so i'm going to grab this arc me with the circle i'm going to get a a noodle a a a macaroni an elbow noodle there we go and i'm going to grab that there's a reason i started off of the axes and here's why right here uh i want to turn this noodle this direction actually a copy of it so i'm hit my modifier key to copy and i going to rotate at 15¬∞ and i want to do that 2x there we go now what i want to do with these intersecting noodles is get just this face out of here i don't really care about all the rest of pieces i just want this selection this chunk right here so i'm going to right click intersect face and intersect with model that's going to break it and now i'm going to grab it option move it out here i'm not going to try to go in and erase these other pieces i'm just going to grab the piece i want get rid of the rest and then take this and put it back on the origin now what i can do is i can rotate this from here modifier key to copy again to here and i'm going say 24x and there we go now i got a solid pumpkin ch it's a big pumpkin i did not realize quite how big a pumpkin i was making um not a big deal because i can always select it all and just do a quick scale down uh but not yet because i want to keep this on the origin soon as i scale it's going to move off the origin all right so i'm going to grab triple click this and i'm going to make it into a group now what we have right here is great it's a great start and actually if i was making a pumpkin i'd throw a stem on this thing and call it done but because i want to make a jack a' lantern means i'm going to want to cut this thing into pieces so what i'm going to do is i'm going to scoot this this uh section plane over and just kind of peek in here and see what we got so right now it's empty cool that's fine that's good that's what it should be but i'm sorry i don't need you anymore teddy thank you for your help i'm going to grab this pumpkin or just the the group i have here i'm going to edit copy and i'm going to say edit paste and place now with that new copy i'm going to hit scale i'm hit the modifier key to scale about the center and i'm going to scale that second one in this so basically what i'm creating is a wall see that now i have thickness but it's not there yet i'm going to hide this section cut so i can come play inside of here cuz i'm going to take this pumpk in this group right here double click in here select all of this and reverse faces so now when i look at it i should see white on the inside white on the outside and in the in between pieces this is the solid part it should be gray that looks perfect before i get rid of my section though i going to throw some color on here i'm going to hit my paint bucket tool to get my my uh mac only colored pencils up i'm sorry windows users this is a mac thing you'll have the normal swatches and stuff i'm going to color the outside orange i'm going to color the inside yellow there we go so now when i cut through uh actually that's not going to work i just colored the outside i just colored the containers i'm going to come in here select a select all color it perfect come in here command a yellow inside i want to color the f faces faces the faces and not the groups of course all right i can get rid of the section cut that's new i didn't know section cut materials wouldn't get cut huh i learned something new today all right let's uh let's fill the rest of that in there that was kind of fun look at that all right so i will be doing a uh video later on about working with sections because of that you learned it here all right let's throw a stem on here real quick for my stem i'm going to go to my polygon just do a a six-sided polygon and i'm just going to pull it out about that big i'm gna make it a little bit of height that and then uh i'm gonna option bring another piece up and we grab that and scale that down about the middle push pull another piece and then we'll take that one and rotate it this and then push pull that out something that um i don't need a lot of detail in the stem i know this looks a little low poly um and i know that i just probably create an extra face inside here i'll delete that one should be the only one all right looks good uh and then i'm going to close that face back up there we go select it all color it dark green and make it a group actually thing i want to do is i to select it all again and soften it real quick because i don't need those those hard edges there we go let me take that over stick that you know on the top down and then this is why i this method modeling is cuz you know it's an organic thing there's no perfect way to do it i can move stuff around all right that's looking pretty good um one thing i am going to want to do is i'm want to take both the inside and the outside group so i can grab with a group select get both of them make that into a new group and come in here and explode both of them what that's doing is taking my inside shell and my outside shell and putting them together to create a hollow solid so if i click on this it still says solid group but it has that inside and outside still that's important when i carve the jackal lantern of course which i'm going to do right now let's go back to a polygon let's do a three-sided polygon i'm going to pull this up that make a triangle copy that triangle right over let's make another triangle for a nose there a little smaller triangle and then i'm going to do an arc let come down from here i'm being i'm being way too precise right now i mean when you go carve a jackal lantern you wing things you're carving uneven shapes on an uneven surface um i i i ugly teeth on my jackal lantern there we go oh beautiful all right there we go classic jackal lantern face i'm going to take each of these pieces and make them tall that grab all of that make it a group we can then take that rotate it this and we'll slide it over slide it forward forward so it's sticking out of the pumpkin a a more or less front view here get that again i don't want to get it centered perfectly so much cuz i'm trying to make it look a you know it's a jack liner it's a little bit off maybe and then we're going to cut it i'm going to hit tap x just to check x-ray green a little bit i want to make sure it cuts through both the inside and the outside faces but doesn't cut through the back wall that's perfect now this is a solid group this is a solid group this has multiple pieces but it will all cut at once using solid tools turn x-ray off but when i go in and hit subtract is the is the the command i'm going to use to cut this out of the pumpkin it's going to leave spaces between the inside face and the outside face of the pumpkin those faces are going to be whatever material is on this geometry so i'm going to select all this geometry i'm going to grab my orange i'm going to edit it a little bit i'm going to go a little bit darker almost a brownish color it's a stylistic choice i know you could you could make an argument for a lighter orange the inside the pumpkin but i want some contrast between the inside and the outside so i'm going to use that brownish color i'm going to take that go to tools i'm go to solid tools i'm to subtract there we go click it's a lot of intersecting so take a second and there we go and see how why i picked my dark i how it makes that the yellow the shining through pop out a little bit and with that we have ourselves a jacko lantern good job so i apologize this is absolutely an intermediate uh tutorial if you're brand new to sketchup i recommend you hop over to sketchup campus learn. sketchup.com run through the fundamentals and then come back and a lot of the stuff we just ran through will make more sense um odds are good if it was too hard and too complicated you already dropped out by now and maybe you left a that said i can't do this is too hard i'm sorry i thought of you just not till now so uh but if you did along and you did make a jack a' lantern we'd love to see it so uh yeah post it up on instagram or facebook and tag sketchup official uh so we can we can see that show up or head over to our forum forums. sketchup.com and it there get it to us we just want to see your pumpkin we don't really care how we get it uh if you that video click down below if you haven't already please do we put out a lot of video content around here and you'll be notified of all of it if you most importantly though leave us a down below uh did you learn something specific with this video is there a new workflow or feature that you didn't know about that you now have uh do you have an idea for a future video let us know any of that down in the comments we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
