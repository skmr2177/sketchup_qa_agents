##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at some amazing visualization features in sketchup 2025 so i don't want to overuse this term but i think it's safe to say that sketchup 2025 allows you to make the best looking sketchup models you've ever made um there's always been tools in there to get import custom materials and and put those on there but but there's some stuff in sketchup 2025 that is just beyond anything you've been able to do with sketchup before um i'm not talking about using rendering engines those are awesome rendering engines are amazing and let you get to that that photo reel thing at the end that's great but sketchup 2025 visualization allows you to create models and work on them and have them just literally the best looking ever uh so we're going to take a look at how that works in sketchup for desktop and we're going to hop in right now okay so i have a model here and this is sketchup we are we are inside sketchup no uh no rendering no post workor at all and you can see some stuff happening here you see uh for one thing look at this look at this face right here on this model as i move this around see how that light changes on it how it reflects that is not a just a a goodlook reflective texture that is actually light playing off of the properties of a material um that's cool that's awesome and let's let's talk a little bit about why and what that all is so the first thing to notice is that this is all sketchup you can see see the colors changing as i move around uh at the same time if i if i come in here i'm going to double click a couple times to get into this thing right here you can see that this right here is just a sketchup surface so here here i'm actually push pulling uh let's uh let's go let's let's push pull so makes a more sense make this a little bit taller so i drag that up and down and you can see that that's that is exactly what this is just sketchup no post no rendering no nothing that this is just goodlook materials and lighting happening right inside sketchup actively uh let's talk about what this exactly means so sketchup 2025 has a different way of vising visualizing models than ever before so if i come over here in styles a couple things to mention uh if i click here to edit my style one of the things that's in here of course is ambient occlusion ambient occlusion was actually in here in the last release but uh ambient occlusion is a part of why these models look so good so when we look down here we see this little little bit of shadow between these two surfaces as they meet little teeny shadow here underneath this person this is all ambient occlusion right this is those uh uded shadows that happen anytime two surfaces come together it's what happens in the real world uh that sort of thing and that is part of what makes this model look as good as it does the other thing that makes it look as good as it does is the materials i'm going to go ahead and hit my paint bucket tool and pull up my colors window now i'm on mac so if you are on windows this is going to look a little bit different but the same information is being portray here so as i look at some of these materials you can see i called this out earlier this this shiny black material here as we move it see how that it reflects on there um the light plays across these different materials so we look down here we've got this grass got this kind of sunset light happening right now where it's bringing in this warmth and this uh this you know deeply angled light this is all part of the 2025 uh visualization so let's talk a little bit about these these new materials that we can put in here uh i'm going to go ahead and leave the colors and model there's a bunch in this model let's go hop in here let's let's look at a brick material i brick uh brick is cool looking probably because i grew up and still live in suburbia and i just don't have enough brick in my life i have to get it and sketch up um so let's grab this we have this context model over here it's kind of this uh semi see-through material but if i click in here a couple times we can get in and we can here's this main face um i want to put a couple materials on here so i'm going to do this i'm going to grab a edge and draw that straight down here and there we go break that into two separate pieces all right and i will grab a brick material i'm just going to grab this one here on the end put that right there and we can zoom in here this is a hu this is a huge this is that's four or five stories tall of just just straight brick but there we go you can see that look at that brick it looks good and as i again as i go this look at how how the the light changes across the face it's not as extreme as that black piece was that black piece was supposed to be a i don't know a painted metal surface you can see it's not not as extreme cuz it's not shiny but you can see how the light changes as i flick back and forth right here and this is again actively on this just a surface and sketchup um that works because let's here let's go home and let's uh i'm going to double click on this material and bring up the properties of this material so this is the big this is a big change that happened inside of sketchup 2025 on how we show materials is rather than just having an image or a color or something that sketchup now has this additional properties in here so we have these four checkboxes metalness roughness normals and ambient occlusion so this one doesn't have a metalness the metalness is that straight up shininess the reflectiveness that that was on that other piece of material if i was to turn this on we'd get much more shine on here than uh than we would actually want on a brick so you can kind of see how that look at how it kind of if we came and put some clear coat over the bricks is what that's going to look the roughness uh i can actually slide this up and down you'll see how that changes too roughness and metalness are almost at odds with each other yet control two slightly different values but i can see here as i drop my roughness down it gets a little bit shinier uh whereas something a brick wall is going to that's kind of the epitome of full rough so we also have normals in here if i crank this up i'll get what i would call two normal i i don't know this is overly normal um but no that's just pulling up those those surfaces so you can see see how the light is reflecting it's coming here in here uh on these pieces between the brick and by sliding that normal up i'm getting more light catching there than i necessarily want but i can change that normal and then of course aman occlusion is that those shadows that happen in inside the texture between the faces and i can actually increase or decrease that as well to get you know less ambient occlusion um you know how i feel about ambient occlusion though where am how am i going to go anything less than one on ambient occlusion so this material uh as we put it in there reacts then with the light that i have in the model so if i look at another material real quick let's just let's just uh let's grab something that's full shine let's go some get some metal let's go grab some metal and i'm just going to throw this highly reflective material oops i'm going to get back in here uh and there we go put that on that material that material on there and you can see there with this that's just that material is fully let's i don't even know let's just go check i'm assuming that's 100% metalness yeah look at that and uh you can see not only is the light changing but because it's so reflective we're actually getting a reflection of the skydome back there as we move around speaking of skydome transition yep segue let's go so another piece of this visualization is what we're seeing all around not just that light i was talking about the light the light is great it's great that it's it's showing light it's lighting things up but you see we also have this image all the way around this image all the way around that that's where the lighting is coming from if i come over here to this new panel called environments you can see what we got in here we got down at the bot we have the our current environment and at the bottom we have a handful of other environments we could switch to so i could switch between these two or the these i think there's 18 in here to start with and that's going to do a couple things not only is it going to change the image in the back but it's actually going to change the lighting values so if i switch to so rather this uh sunrise sky right here i'm going to switch to this one which is at c you can see not only did the background change but that lighting changed considerably that warm deep reflection reflective light that was coming in from the side that's gone instead we have this kind of cool cool that's that's the word to use cool lighting coming in all around uh so we can see as we switch these different things we're going to get different lights coming in from different spots and then we're also going to get a change of that sky dome if i click on edit right here there's some things i can actually change as well so uh i can change the rotation angle of that skydome you can see not only does that switch that around what's behind me but it also changes the lighting as well we can also change the exposure both of the skydome itself so you can fade that sky doome in and out and i can actually reflections i can increase or decrease those as well so a lot of control over this but uh one of my favorite things to do in here is to check this little box right here set sun location and you'll see what happens is here's the skydome image right this is the the image of the whole thing here laid out flat you see there's a little sunlight location on here the sun location by default is where the sun is in the image but i have the ability to just grab that and start sliding it around and put it in different places and then i can see how that actually changes the reflection on my my model how that changes the lighting so pretty cool uh a neat way to go in and fine-tune how do you want so not just before you know we could we could say use sun is shading and then we could set the day in time and it would drop a shadow uh that kind of thing this gives us a just a new level of control over how we visualize and i want to drop one more show you one more thing here that i think is super cool uh i'm going to drop right down in here i got this little box just kind of sitting out front i'm going to put a new material on here so i'm going to say file i'm going to go to import and out here on my desktop i have this tile material i'm going to import that as a texture this isn't new this is this is old stuff right so i'm going to grab that and i'm start pulling across that and uh there we go it tiles it this should look familiar because what i just did is just standard stuff i imported that you see i didn't that material was not seamless so i have this obvious seam right across here um not beautiful looking not bad but uh not great so it did come in as material with reflectivity so you can see i have metalness on there i'm seeing the light shine on here that's awesome that happened automatically but you can see it it looks a vinyl sticker is on this thing right it's one flat piece there's no normals there's no uh ambient occlusion there's no it's not honoring the fact that i have grout here versus tile none of that's happening fortunately it's almost as if i set that up intentionally to teach you something i did uh if i pick this material if i double click on there uh when this comes up i get this little generate texture magic pixie dust sprinkly icon and i'm just going to go ahead and click on it and let sketchup 2025 use the power of ai to analyze this material figure out not just how to make it seamless because that's what it obviously needs they have these weird shaped tiles in here they should all be the same so i'm not only going to get a seamless texture right now but it's actually going to figure out what my roughness and normal maps should look as well so when it's done it's going to give me okay not only i said there's my seamless but i can actually see when i look at it see how the the light plays differently off the grout than it does to the tile and that happens automatically and now that material is part of my model so if i come in here look at this go back go back to my my material in my model and i will see that there's that material and now i can use that just any other material apply that it created used ai to create a brand new texture material there that i can apply anytime and have it behave just any of the default materials that i've been using throughout the rest of my model so there you go there's a a quick shot a quick idea of how to use sketchup 2025 to create the best looking sketchup models you have ever created that wasn't meant to be disparaging i'm sure you've created some amazing looking mods in the past but i for one am excited to see see what you can do with these features how do you take your good-look models and make them look even better using new materials image based lighting and maybe even a little bit of ai i'd have nowhere to go i had nowhere to close that let's try that one last time that was not meant to be disparaging i'm sure you've created some amazing looking models in the past but think about what you could do with this new materials these these physical based materials this uh image based lighting and a little bit of ai i for one can't wait to see what your sketchup modes look now thank you [music]
