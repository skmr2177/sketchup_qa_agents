##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: transforming a woven basket model with pbr ‚ú® (sketchup tutorial) video id: rbju9dlkms4 playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbju9dlkms4 uploader: sketchup duration: 755 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-22t15:08:39.670531 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- , it's and today i want to show you how to import pbr materials into [music] sketchup. so the new version of sketchup, sketchup 2025, has the ability to pbr materials and environmental lighting. and with this you can get, you know, depth to your materials. so you can get uh shadows inside the materials. you can actually have high points, low points, ambient occlusion inside of the material, not just the geometry. uh, it's pretty cool. sketchup is shipped with a whole bunch of pbr materials. there's a bunch of them up on 3d warehouse. but what do you do if you need your own? if you got to go get your own specific materials and import them, we're going to take a look at how to do that right now. all right. so, i have right here a uh my attempt at a quick low poly easter basket. so, i didn't want to go in and necessarily model all the weaving of a wicker thing. i wanted to keep it kind of simple, kind of light. and i did it, but it looks a wooden bucket. it it just does not look a a basket, right? because i used i used a one of the wood materials. so, if i come in here uh to my default materials, wood. i grab this first material, put it on here. so, it looks okay. um, you know, and if i was far away from it, i' i'd buy that is what it is. uh, i'm okay with the way the materials lined up on the handle. just this right here does not look baskety. so, i want to import a new material to put on here to give it that wicker weave look. so, i'm going to do that. um, i'm going to start with some throwaway geometry just just to make this easier. so, i'm just going to come over here and create a surface. so, uh, so i have something to put this material on as i import it. um, so i did go download a pbr material. so it downloaded a handful of different files. so it's not just a simple throw material on there. it's got multiple images in there for things ao and for a normal map and that kind of thing. so uh, as we pull this in, i'll we'll show you how to do all of that. that's what we're going to do right now. so i'm going to go to file, import just i would with a regular texture. uh, i have this saved in this basket weave folder. and you can see, i said, this this imported a bunch of bunch of different files. so, here's my basket weave. this is the actual material. this is the thing that looks weave basket. but then i also have an ao map, ambient occlusion map, and a normal map in here. also, initially, i'm just going to grab that main image. this is the image of the texture. this is what's going to look the basket weave. i'm going to import it as a texture. come into import. and import this just i would with a regular material. so, i'm going to click there. i'm going to start scaling it up. i'm gonna go to, you know, about where i want it to be on uh on this material, you know. so, what's what's going to look right on that basket? so, i'm going to go about there. uh this is a tiling material. so, this is already created so that it does tail tile properly. and you can see right there, right when i just just when i import it, that already looks better than what i have on here. it looks a basket. um it is flat. so, as i look at it, it does look i always say it looks a laminate sticker, right? because if i if i spin around far enough, i'll get the environmental light to put some shine on there. but see how that shine hits it and it just hits uniformly. it's just hitting it a light would hit a uh a piece of laminate image a poster or something that. so that's what we're going to do now is we're going to go through and we're going to make this into more of a pbr material. look at all these nooks and crannies that we should be seeing the light play with. that's we're going to set up right now. so, i'm going to go back home. you can see right here at the bottom, here's my new material i just imported. if i double click on that, i get the the material properties pop up. so, in here, when you import a material just this, when i just grab an image, pull it in as a texture, just you've been doing with sketchup for years and years and years, it pulls it in, and it does give it basic uh metalness and roughness. this is a default that's set up in your settings. so when it comes in it's it has 0.13 metalness.5 uh roughness and i can of course slide that to make it more metally or more rough. so metal is kind of a reflectiveness and roughness is the opposite of reflectiveness and it kind of pushes away light. some people look at something this and go well i don't want any metalness. that's fine. i have found that giving it a little bit of metal regardless of what the material is gives me more control. so i can actually, you know, when i crank up the metalness, the darks become it's almost more contrast with with metalness versus no metalness. so, uh, even on something this, which is a fairly rough material, it's not it's not, you know, it's not super shiny. i would probably still keep metalness on. i'd probably keep it low, but we'll play with a little more once we get all the materials in here. so, right now, you can see with that, i said, if we look at it from the side, we get the the the environmental light bounce off it. makes it real bright there where the light's hitting it. but let's uh let's keep going here with this. let's add some more. let's add some a normal map and an ambient occlusion map. again, with the free uh pbr that i downloaded, it came with the normal map and ambient occlusion map. so, i'm just going to say i'm going to turn on a normal and i'm going to go grab my normal png and open it. and that's going to right away apply it. and you see how that just popped right now. look at how these look they come up more than this. see that? looks it rises up over. that's just the normal map. and you can see how the light plays on it already. you see that? if as i as i come over here, see how the the right side of each of these bumped out pieces lights up more as i move it across. that's what the normal map does. the normal map tells it you have uh you know higher and lower spots so the light interacts with it as though there was actual geometry here. so this can be increased or decreased just the others. i can really crank it up and you can see not not only is the shapes of these loops uh in that normal map, but you can actually see there's some grain here, right? so, in this wicker, there's actually grain. as you crank it up, you can see that gets oops, i grabbed roughness. wrong one. as i crank this up, you can see that that grain really shows up. um i probably don't want to go that hard. that looks it's made of some kind of angry plastic or something. so, we're going to crank it back down, but still give it a little bit so it pops up. um again, all of these kind of play together, too. so, as i as i crank up the roughness, less light's going to reflect. if i drop it all the way down, it looks it's wet and shiny. um, so probably somewhere in the middle is where i want to go with that. i also have the ability with this normal map to change where the light is hitting. so, see that? so, i can i can basically flip the normal map. um, generally speaking, light's going to come from above. uh, so, you know, i can i can play how does that light hit? how do i want to switch that? um, and there you go. so, these loops coming out get light on the top rather than on the bottom because it's lit from above. but i can flip the normal map by hitting this little button here. all right, one more piece we're going to add. we're going to throw ambient occlusion on here. again, ambient occlusion. we're going to load the ao file that came with this pbr. and there we go. and that was ambient occlusion is much more subtle. um, even cranked all the way up. but you'll see it's this is kind of the contrast button. so, you can see look at see how that that little shadow shows up. watch this. just right here. watch right here how this interacts. if i pull it all the way back, the two materials come butt up against each other. as i crank it up, i get a little bit of a shadow between there showing the overlap. so, by doing that now, it looks i have over overlapping materials as i move around rather than just that flat image of the materials overlapping. so, that looks pretty good. let's take that material now and let's apply it to the basket. now, on a flat surface this, it's pretty simple. it's done. if i was doing the back of a chair or the seat of a chair or something that, a wicker chair, i would be finished. uh because this is a material that needs to wrap. i don't have uv wrapping in sketchup. so, i do need to apply to the individual faces. so, all i'm going to do is turn on i'm going to go to view and i'm going to turn on my hidden geometry. that's going to show me the brakes. and then i can say i can come in with my paint bucket and i will sample this material and put it right here onto let's get out here. let's close this. all right, there we go. pick that. drop it right here. um, and then i can just sample, grab, put on the next one. so, i just sample each individual material and paste it onto the next one. so, what this does is it effectively wraps that material in a circle around here. um, if i just projected it on there, which would be an option, that'd be something you do on a a banner or something that, uh, it would look great from the front, but the sides, the material will get stretched out to wrap the rest of the way around. so, by quickly doing this, just kind of clicking this around, uh, i'm actually telling it to break the material at each side. and there we go. so, we did end up with a little bit of a seam. um, i'll probably fix that by going this. and turn it around. , looks good again. there we go. um, yeah. so, see how much nicer that looks? i could do the same thing on the inside, too. i could come in here and then do same thing. just sample click, sample click, uh, and wrap it around the inside as well. uh, i could even drop it on the bottom if i wanted to to just kind of sell that this whole thing is made of wicker except for the handle. um, the other thing i could do is i could also adjust the color of the wood i used so it's more in line with the material in the wicker. and that'll just make it, you know, kind of sell that it's all goes together less than uh, you know, it's not going to look the exact same material, but it'll it'll make it look cohesive. so, there we go. that with that. um, i'm getting closer. so you can kind of see you can see what i'm talking about there. look at how the material look as i flip it around as i look at the light chase across the material as i go that. let's get those let's get those edges turned back off again. there we go. so there we go. a quick and easy. i said, this is not something i would want to push out to render. this is not a hero basket or anything a hero basket. have those words ever been muttered before? um but it is low poly. there's not a whole lot of geometry to this thing. um, and it looks pretty good. and i said, because the light hits on it, it's actually going to interact with the environment as well. let's get let's get rid of this thing because this is the here we go. this is the star. in fact, sorry, tomtom, you got you got to there we go. we got our basket. uh, so there we go. a quick and easy wicker basket using pbr materials. i know i called it quick and easy and then spent 10 minutes doing that. but uh that was a lot of explanation too. i was showing how materials get pulled in, what each of those values are, and then individually pulling in. um to actually do that is a couple if you have the files, it's a texture import, and then import normal, import ao, and then you're adjusting and fine-tuning and and you're good to go. it really is a very quick process. and once it's in there, that material then can actually be saved into a template or part of my default material. so, i don't have to do that every single time. i pull materials in once, save them, and then they can be part of sketchup forever, i guess, or a very long time. i don't know, whichever comes first. but, uh, yeah, there we go. uh, quick and easy way to get that in there. pbr materials, great great way to add depth to your geometry. it keeps you from having to have really dense material, dense files, and just kind of simplifies the process, which is really cool. if you that video, click down below. and if you haven't already, please do . we create several videos each and every week, and you'll be notified of all of them if you . most importantly, though, please do leave us a . uh, have you played with pbr materials? do you have specific use cases you've come up with? do you have specific questions about using them? is there a different part of sketchup you think would make a good video this? let us know down in the comments. we making these videos a lot, but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see. thank you.
