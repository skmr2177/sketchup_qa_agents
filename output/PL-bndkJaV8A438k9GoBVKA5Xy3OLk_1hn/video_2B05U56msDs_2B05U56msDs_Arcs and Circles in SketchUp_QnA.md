##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i want to talk a little bit about how arcs and circles work inside a sketchup so this topic has actually come up a couple of times recently in uh i've seen it in some posts on the forum and comments on videos uh just about exactly how it works um as far as something would be called a true arc or a true circle versus the segmented geometry that's created by sketchup so i want to dive in and talk how that works um exactly what happens and what you can expect and what you actually need to do with it let's take a look all right so first things first uh this we have here i just drew a little a circle and an arc and if i pick on it you can actually see it if i zoom in on the circle you can see the segments see these little it's a series of straight lines that connect together into a circle this is how sketchup draws this geometry so it draws this in a series of segments it's what makes it so quick and easy to create geometry this is that it's actually just working with a bunch of surfaces um just we're start with faction i'm going to talk about how you'd use it yet but just to start with the basics a default circle has 24 sides you can see here if i select the circle i look in the entity info i can see how many i have here if i want to i could actually come in and make that more or less if i type 12 you'll see those segments much more pronounced if i jump up something 48 they're harder to see if i jump double that to 96 don't worry i did that math ahead of time i'm not doing that on the fly you can see that they they virtually go away if i zoom in here eventually i will be able to see the actual individual lines from here to here but they're significantly smaller this is of course when you come in to draw a circle so if i if i come in here and i go circle uh in the measurements box down here it says how many sides we want to draw in and then as i pull that across and i'm going to do something exact measurement i'm going to make this 10 inch radius and uh that means from one side to the other is exactly 20. but i can change that as i put it in so if i come in here this is the reason i did this if i if i select the circle it's going to tell me this is a 10 inch radius so if i draw a line from one side straight across the other side it's going to tell me that that is one foot eight dynamometers box 20 inches so this is important to note so if i go from here to here 20 inches that line is 20 inches one foot eight now if i go from the next segment to the next segment down same thing it's going to tell me that's one foot eight if i split that right if i go in the middle if i go from the middle of this edge to the middle of this edge my measurements box says that is approximately one foot seven and thirteen sixteenths so from the middle of this surface i'm not or this this face right here i'm not actually getting that full 20 inches i'm getting about 3 16 less so this is important this is i mean of of all the stuff we're talking about this is probably one of the most important parts when you look at a circle sketchup knows that this circle is created based on this 10 inch radius so from the center to any of these points is always going to be 10 inch what happens in between though is it's chopping that chunk off so it is a little bit off it's just something to note so if if i ever have uh you know something where i need to come in and come up with an exact measurement at this circle cut into so many sides i need to make sure that those points i'm cutting at are at points this is why we make a big deal about when you draw a circle how many segments you use we always a lot of times we'll recommend put your segments in and call it you know something that's a divisible by four so you always have the same number of segments in each quadrant how many in there is going to depend on what you're using it for so if i wanted to do something where i was doing a lot of tangential work circles bumping up against circles or arcs coming off of circles something that it's going to be a little more tricky with sketchup than maybe some other drawing program that's that's uh you know a different vector based program because i'm not necessarily going to have those points where i need them to figure out tangential connections or anything that so it is important to make sure you understand where those points are and that those points are on the circle whereas the lines actually cut inside sketchup does remember that this is a circle so as long as it's a circle here i can do things i can change my radius i can change the segments i can do that sort of thing as i'm working with the circle because it remembers that until i do something say i come in here and i push pull this up so now it still remembers this is a circle but because it's connected to other geometry i can't change the segments so the points i have on here are the only points i will have as long as this is connected to this other geometry same thing goes for rx as i draw arcs so i drove through this arc drew it as 12 just snapped it across to a point same thing here i can come in here and i can increase or decrease the number of points in this arc and again if i look if i if i come in here and let's see let's make this something nice and even we'll make this exactly three foot so if i come in here and i draw a line from here back to the center of that radius that line is exactly three foot so any of these points back to the radius is going to show exactly three foot from in between if i go to the center point of one of these segments there it's 2 foot 11 11 16. so it's not going to show the same because the actual true arc goes just outside of that by a couple sixteenths of an inch now this is good to know and i'll be totally honest for a lot of geometries gets created for architecture larger models that this is perfectly fine this is having this broken into segments and sometimes can actually work in your benefit because you can break it down into pieces that you're going to work with there's sometimes going to be more conscious or increased geometry so let's look at a couple examples so let's say this geometry that i created this this arc and this circle are getting used to create maybe this is a site plan this is i know super simplified but i want you to see the original geometry here's this here's this um is this going to matter is this going to be significant to show where this circular building sits on this site plan with an arc here i don't know maybe maybe in a case so if i'm just looking this from above and this is i'm going to lay out and put some dimensions on here and this is all that it is this is probably okay this is probably fine if i'm going to go in and maybe i have these these are some sort of steel panels that have to be detailed that wrap around a circle probably not going to work right because if i go view hidden geometry and i see this this is a flat panel this is a flat panel this is a flat panel so it's not going to be ideal to to detail out these pieces now maybe these pieces are just big flat pieces this and this is actually how it's being built if so great if i actually need details of this geometry curving around the true circle i'm going to want to increase the number of sides for the circle first before i come in and extrude it so in that case i don't know it's possible it's enough information it's possible it is enough geometry but i'm might be a little bit short if i need to go into more detailing this so let's talk about scaling stuff down and uh say we're printing this out so i'm going to put this into a 3d print and print it out i'll take this and i'm going to do a me just create something that so say these are pieces i'm going to actually print out is this enough information is this enough sides so these are both 24 this donut or washer or whatever you want to call it uh 24 size 24 sides is that going to be big enough well if this whole thing is a quarter inch across you know what that should be more than enough detail to get me the circle that i need same thing here this little this little tube thing i'm creating here say this is an inch across that 24 sides is more than enough now if this is much larger this is going to be cut up into multiple pieces and this is going to fill my print bed a whole bunch of times since the detail of a building or something that then i probably want to increase the number of sides same thing here if this is going to be a large piece that i want to print the size of a pool noodle i'm going to actually see these segmented sides when i print it so the question comes across well why don't i just put all of my circles in as you know 96 sides or 999 sides why don't i just make them all that big well the issue comes very quickly in the amount of geometry putting a sketchup so it is going to behave quicker more snappy better i'm going to have fewer snap points to snap to if i don't have all those extra points so again depending what i'm doing a lot of times we'll scale my circles or my arcs depending on how big the geometry is so this is a small piece of detail i might go with 12 even sides because i don't even need 24 if this is only you know a quarter inch across something large say this is a foot across here i'll probably bump that up if i'm 3d printing it out it's 96 sides just to give myself a little more smoothness around the outside but then other practical applications come in too right am i going to take that am i going to sand it to remove the print lines anyhow if so those segments are less important or mean a little bit less at that point another example what if i'm going to take this and i'm going to export this to a cnc machine to get cut out of a piece of plywood well this is a whole different answer because if i export this geometry as a 3d dxf it's important a 3d dxf not a 2d you have an option when you export dxfs do 2d or 3d so even though it's cut flat if you export this as a 3d dxf that 3d dxf is going to take this segmented circle and translate it into a true curve same with this arc as long as these aren't broken right so as long as this is a one circle and this is one arc it's going to look at the radius and it's going to export that geometry as a true arc it's going to export this circle as a true circle so the file that exports and actually goes to your cnc will give you nice true curves even though i see segments right here inside of sketchup so i'm hoping that cleared up the questions or concerns uh of how sketchup deals with these arcs and i said this is just fundamental this is how the the drawing program works is how it creates that geometry um so it's kind of fundamental to the function of sketchup the important thing is that you understand how it works and how it works in relation to what you are modeling for we talk about this all the time level of detail is extremely important but it is also extremely tightly tied to what you're doing if your whole goal is to create something that you're going to go render totally different needs and requirements in your model than if what you're taking is going to go to a cnc machine or a 3d printer so it's important to model to what your final deliverable is going to be and that's just another thing you need to keep in mind is how circles and arcs are going to work in that case if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create a whole bunch of videos every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you more importantly they'll leave us a down below uh have you run into this issue is this helpful for you are there other ideas you think would make good videos or questions you have we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
