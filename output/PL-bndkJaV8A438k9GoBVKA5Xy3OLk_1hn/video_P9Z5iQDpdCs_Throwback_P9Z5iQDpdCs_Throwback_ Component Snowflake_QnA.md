##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's january it's snowy outside and i figured let's use components to make a [music] snowflake now if this idea sounds familiar something you've seen before that's definitely possible so this concept was one of the first the very first learning videos we put out on our youtube channel it was made by tyson kartner back i i don't know over a decade ago and it is an awesome example of how components work and i just thought let's do it let's do that thing and uh yeah there's still something to be learned from it and it seems appropriate so let's hop in let's do it right now all right so first thing i to do is um i want to do this and i want to i want to put it around uh what we're going to do is we're going to create a hexagon a six ided shape cuz you know snowflakes have six sides and i want to do it on the ground right here at the origin this isn't required but i find a lot of times when i start making symmetrical things if i can work from this one spot it makes a little bit easier for me so i'm going to take a line straight up the green axis that um i'm going to actually take out teddy and here's what we're going to do i want to make one slice from basically i want to take out one sixth of this and make it into a component and then copy it around so i'm going to come right here and i'm going to go from here up to here i'm going go from here up to here i'm just snapping from the middle point to the middles so from the middle of the hexagon where i started at the origin up to the midpoints on these two sides and i can delete this so this is the piece that i want to mirror around so i'm going to take this and i'm going to a component and i'm going to say this is a flake chunk there we go apparently i'm going to yell it all in caps so i'm going to take that now and i'm going to rotate it from the center from here option rotate to here i'm going to say 5x and hit enter and there we go now let's make things even simpler so i'm going to go into one of these copies and i'm going to cut this copy in half and then get rid of this half over here i'm going take that and make that into a new component um half chunk all right and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to take that and i'm going to mirror that mirror command to right there all right so there we go so now all i have to do is come into this one piece make my snowflake shape and it's going to show up in all the other pieces so let's go ahead i'm just g to i'm going to just make some shapes here i'm going to try to do something i don't know i've i've i've done this process of making a snowflake multiple times i said the first time i did this i did it because i saw tyson's video on how to do this and i thought it was cool and i wanted to try it so uh but every time i do it i'm what does this snowflake look again you know it's one of those things that honestly i don't have a lot of context for i don't pay a whole lot of attention to snowflakes in general but uh but yeah i uh i always struggle a little bit to remember what a snowflake looks when i have to recall one from scratch so this is my version of something a snowflake so i'm just inferencing i'm doing some parallel some uh oh you know what we should do let's go here to the middle and uh do something this so i'm going to go from this point to here and no you know what i want to do is i i i appreciate that you're playing along as i argue with myself about what i should or shouldn't do um yeah that's that makes me feel nice appreciate you just being there for me that all right we're g put another piece right here feel i don't know at this point i'm feeling maybe i should have spent a little bit of time just looking at some snowflakes i know they're not uh you know perfectly symmetrical and stuff that so um i'm actually going to make a change here i'm going to bring this down further this instead of going all the way up that and then i'm going to delete some of these outside parts and then that and with that we have a six-sided uh snowflake pretty quick pretty easy but i don't all these edges on the inside in fact i want to go in i want to put a hole in the middle too so i'm going to double click to go into a chunk double click to go into a half a chunk and i'm just going to go do something this and then erase those pieces oh that was a little too big i got too big there let's try this that there we go give that opening there at the bottom and the other thing i want to do is i want to make sure there's i want even seams here so i am going to grab my eraser and i'm going to hold on shift shift is going to allow me to hide the edges so there's still edges there there we go if you look at that you can see the grade out portion versus this portion and if we actually go to view hidden edges hidden geometry we'll see the dotted lines there but because i hid them from view it looks it's all one big piece so if i click out now there we go pretty quick pretty easy i have a simple easy to do snowflake let's uh probably the last thing to do would be to grab all these pieces and make it a group in and of itself that way you can do stuff take that rotate it up and then guess i don't have to put it back on the a i can put over here but there you go simple snowflake i could always come in here and do some stuff too maybe go into one of these pieces and give a little bit of depth something that might look kind of cool too yeah quick easy to make snowflake um actually when i did that i i uh realized there's some edges i still have so i'm going to come in here and uh shift erase whoops shift erase that edge as well and then actually add one here too one or two there we go and there we go quick and easy 3d snowflake from a single piece so if i come in here all that just came off of this one piece so yeah that was that was a pretty quick uh example quick quick model but uh it's the new year we're just getting rolling again and uh i mean you are i'm trying to take it easy on you i'm not not go too advanced you know anything that but i just want to show that and remind you of that i'm going to try to find and link to the original file so i would love to hear you uh you know your thoughts on the original thoughts on this let me know what you think of that first one and let me know if you've tried this if you've done this before uh this is a perfect example of how components work especially when you talk about mirror array and then uh you know flipping a component that kind of stuff but if you do it right it's less work to create more stuff and with repetitive jall this makes it super easy to do if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please leave us a down below have you done this have do you remember the original video or do you have some other ideas totally unrated this you think could make good videos the the good good lessons we could show on our youtube channel we making these videos a lot we them even more when the showing something you want to see thank you [music]
