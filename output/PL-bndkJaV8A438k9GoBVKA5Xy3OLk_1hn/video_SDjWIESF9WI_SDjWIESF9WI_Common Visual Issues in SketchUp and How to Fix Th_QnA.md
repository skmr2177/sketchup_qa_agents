##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to look at some of the top visual issues you might run into sketchup and how to fix them with as little as one button [music] click okay so visualization issues i know it's kind of a vague description uh stuff going on on your screen in your model that you don't expect or don't want to be happening does that make sense so this isn't modeling issues this isn't geometry is not right this is uh it doesn't look the way i hold it i wanted it to look um we see these things on the forum all the time and it's funny cuz i would say majority of the time there's a super simple fix something that wasn't quite set up right or a setting that's wrong um and we're going to run through a bunch of those right now okay so first one you have probably already seen it see these dashed edges in back here these show up uh these are back edges so this is a function inside of sketchup this is intentional it's supposed to work work this way uh this is showing where the back edges are the edges that aren't visible to the camera are overlaid onto my model so all these little dash lines are actually the back edges and this is a function that is supposed to happen this way to show me where those are so this is without going into uh to x-ray mode where i see through the model which is a very intensive process to to make everything see through this is a short simple sweet much lighter process so you're working the big model and you want to see where the back edges are where the the stuff you can't see is back edges will let you see that without having to do an x-ray on the whole model that's the idea behind it um people toggle it on on accident all the time because the default shortcut key for it is just k if you were typing and you hit a k or something that or you you go to hit l to hit the line you accidentally tap k something that your back edges will show up fortunately it's just as easy to turn off as it is turn on you could hit k the shortcut key or if you men you go to view edge style and right there see it's toggled on you just toggle it off and that goes away pretty simple all right next thing that comes up i'm going to go over here into my styles menu and i'm going to look right now i have ambient occlusion turned on but i don't see those telltale little shadows so what i do when that happens is i turn up the distance no turn up the intensity no for some reason my ambient occlusion shadows are just not showing up what is that about well again i'm going to say use that term again nine times out of 10 but often what happens is people see this issue and it's because their model is not to scale so they either were haphazardly just went in started modeling and didn't realize they were modeling something way bigger than they thought or they accidentally scaled their model up some something that um the fact is ambient oclusion is a onetoone effect so it scales shadows at intersections based on reality and the scale of things in real life so if i come in here if i grab an edge and i go from one corner here to this corner over here i can see that is currently 46,000 ft no 4600 4,600 ft too big either so yeah 46,000 would be big but 4600 is also too big so this model got out of scale because this is supposed to be 32 ft so what we're going to do i'm going to double click to enter this group right my tape measure and tell it from here to here should be 32t enter do i want to scale this group yes i do there we go and then i'm just going to hit oh see immediately see those shadows pop right in there they're a little excessive right now so i may want to actually come in and dial them back just a little bit maybe a little less intense uh i don't know maybe it's supposed to be a haunted house and they should be intense anyhow that will get that for you there we go all right next issue you're probably already seeing it on your screen see as i rotate how i'm especially look at these columns right here it's easiest to see here see how they're just jumping back and forth crazy that is an issue that is actually pretty easy to fix so what we're going to do is we're going to look at exactly how to fix that problem you also see right here see the front and back faces kind of start popping through each other this is not z fighting some people see this and go oh that's just z fighting those back edges are popping through but these are actually the faces are overlapping each other as i move these things are jumping by a couple pixels across back and forth on the screen the issue with this is that this model is too far from the origin this is the same issue that we run into with sometimes you want to model really small geometry you won't let you similar issues happen when you model too big of geometry so this can happen with an import model with you know real world location or or or or uh numbers in here where where this is ends up real far away from where the origin is so first i want to do is go to view and see if my axes are turned on they are turned on okay so now how do i get this oh i saw i saw it go by there's my axis see that and i am so so far away from it i can't even see oh there it is all right so let's do this let's grab this let's grab by corner and let's try to get to the axis i'm going to zoom way i'm zoom way out and just come over here click on the axes and then let's go back to there we go so i grabbed an arbitrary corner which turned out to be that one probably fix it up now and same that corner should be in there but you see now as i oh see nice clean nice clean orbiting that's awesome all right so something else some of you probably are already seeing this and going i i have a weird perspective on this this doesn't this almost looks i don't know something something feels weird about this perspective and i don't know some people will hit this some people will it almost feels an isometric view and i'm not getting that true perspective so it doesn't look a real model it looks wonky looks off um if i come up to camera and i see that it's not in parallel projection but it is in perspective but it still feels almost it's in parallel projection it's hard to describe but you can see when i look at this right here i would expect this back edge of this roof to look significantly smaller than this because this is closer to me and this as it goes in the distance should come together but it almost looks parallel or even flared out which is a little bit of an optical illusion but this happens sometimes um so if you go up here and you're in parallel projection you switch to perspective everything fixes that's great but if you're already in perspective it means your field of view is probably set extremely low so if i click on field of view and look down the lower right corner yep it's set to one so what i'm going to do is set it to the default is about 35 so hit 35 and hit enter there you go see how that makes much more it just looks more real so if i look at this see that the front edge is wider than the back edge so it it gets smaller as the as the model goes off in the distance just a more natural look this is not you don't have to do this but a lot of people expect their models to look this when you're working with the in 3d excuse me um and that is a quick and easy fix just check your field of view check to see that you actually are in perspective view all right so another thing that might happen that looks weird is why do i have a gray chimney if i pick on this face of the material and i click entity info it tells me this mat material is this terracotta color but for whatever reason it's showing up as gray um well that gray color is actually the back so in entity info i have two boxes the front face and the back face the back face has looks two materials but this is actually telling me it's a two-sided material the back face has a material that on the front is white and on the back is this blue gray and since these are all showing up as blue gray it's telling me that those face i'm seeing the back face if i want to double check this i can go to my view and i can go to face style and i can turn on monochrome monochrom going to show everything front or back faces you can see very clearly that is all back face so i easy fix again select the faces that our back face right click and hit reverse face and they come out white in monochrome and if i go back up to face style and turn shade with textures on again that's the proper color that was what i'm looking for right there so if you ever see materials that look they're not quite right or they're showing up as gray or whatever your back face color is easy enough to flip them i'm seeing one more issue right here this material i don't understand what's going on there why is that oh if i zoom in i can see it is a brick material it just somehow got scaled down so it's easy enough to select materials and go to position and with position you can rotate change scale that sort of thing but if you ever get it to the point where it's not the way you want it to be you do have the option of going to texture and hitting reset position that will put it back to the default the way it was originally applied to the material so that's something that surprisingly people run into materials of different scal not just not just scaled small but scaled large why are my bricks 3 feet tall each there's a possibility that the material got scaled so there you go i said a handful what was that six different things that could happen in your sketchup model and how to quickly and i got to say pretty easily get them fixed um this of course i said is not comprehensive there's other things you might run into and maybe you have seen some visual issues and you fix them or maybe you've seen some visual issues and you don't know how to fix them they're still an issue for you if either of those is true leave us a down below tell us about issues you've run into and how you gotten past them or tell us issues that you're still running into and you need help with if you haven't already done it too hop in there and hit if you this video if you haven't already we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a i said tell us about those issues you run into or if you have an idea for a different video that you think would be good you making these videos a lot me more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
