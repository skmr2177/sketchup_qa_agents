##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and i'd to invite you to sit with me and let's talk some sketchup [music] philosophy now philosophy may be misleading um i want to talk about kind of an approach to modeling that kind of bends some of the the typical rules that i think i think are good rules that i think you should you should where you're usually using components to separate most of your geometry uh naming them well that sort of thing and we're going to talk about an approach which is kind of sloppy a little messy um and why that might be uh something you use on occasion now again this is sloppy it's not best modeling practice practices but let's jump in and you can decide if this is something you want to use on occasion uh as an approach so let's say i am just designing some tables or some sort of furniture or something let's come back here this example is what you would typically uh hopefully see even this this taable toop is a component it's named correctly this is a table leg there's four of them it's a component and uh these stretchers so uh each piece uh is a component and if this table if we'd made something different from the front from the back we'd make that a unique component if we were making um let's say we're just you know exploring some ideas when we move this um out of the way we need to remember to make unique uh these components especially you know depending on what changes we're making maybe we are going to make this um a little narrower so we make these unique we move these back four inches grab the rest of our s you know pieces move those back for inches but what happens is uh something this where i'll grab the tabletop also move it back for ines but i often depending on the complexity of the model um you you may forget to make it unique and so now depending on how many iterations you've got you you've you've got some errors to to fix or or problems introduced now the correct approach really is to be in a in the good habit of of always making things unique when you need to make them unique but i i tend to at times uh take a different approach which is this table and this table is made up of basically a corner assembly so i don't have a full full tabletop i don't have a full stretcher i do have um a leg but you can see that uh i'm just got this kind of corner assembly and that alone um would create problems if the time comes to let's say break the model out into its parts so that we can start introducing some dimensions and and uh now we've got to rebuild this uh into its parts so it's it for that reason it's it's not you know it's not a long-term model there's other reasons why this could fail the other thing about this actually let me just undo the other thing about this that's a little bit kind of against the rules is if i go into my assembly this tabletop despite that it's in an assembly that it's component it's a group this leg is a group if i take this leg copy it paste it outside uh i'm editing it without making it unique because it's just a group sitting in there but that is also the point that is why i will do this sometimes because i want to make fast um simple changes and so i will take this approach typically in an early stage where i am just saying i i want to explore ideas more than anything else so i know i'm going to have to rebuild some of the geometry i know i'm not necessarily getting uh fully into um every detail or joinery but it's easy because all i have to do is grab my four assemblies and make them unique and then when i go in everything inside is a group so even though the assemblies thems elves i'm not worried about this piece that i just left behind because uh they groups inside now again that's that sort of works sometimes it sort of doesn't work sometimes that's i don't think this is a great design but that's the point so i'm coming in and saying you know what uh um let's make this whole thing two inches deeper and how's that look i don't know not great good that's the point i'm going to make another copy make those four corners unique and try again and and keep messing with some iterations here um so that's i let's walk through a quick um setup i this should make sense um as to how this uh is set up should be pretty pretty straightforward to understand it does break down the efficiency of this as you get more and more complicated or as your geometry is non-symmetrical it does break down and and will work or not and then you have to introduce kind of components back into the mix that you make unique etc okay with that in mind here's a couple things if you do want to try this sort of um approach again messy not necessarily um you know just definitely it's it's best if you're you only model and you're the only one who's going to see this a year later and you're what this is a wreck so if you're going to do it a couple things to keep in mind mind let's take this tabletop or let's say this one this tabletop in this case just um the legs down here are the assembly i do having this assembly because when i say oh you know what i want to play with let's move that in two in and move that together one inch um let's move this back and um very quick to to move move and have the whole assembly move but the top here um i didn't include it easy enough to to adjust that if i want to say you know what we we want that top to be 2 in longer on either side easy change but let's let's set it up we did back here one thing that can happen uh in general is try try to get your initial set up up um pretty basic so that you you're not always adjusting details and in this case if i wanted to make this top i can't simply um if i want to embed this top into this corner i have to now do something where oh i i've i've got to intersect with model because i've got this detail this chamfer down here or i've got to take the time to you know cut this apart so i may i i will have probably wanted to do this originally before i put that chamfer in there because now i have to go through and draw it not that it's that detail that hard but the more detailed this is the more difficult this would be to construct or to fix and we'd have to use some other stuff other method but let's cut that out paste in place another thing to do um if you're going to use this method that is really helpful is just be comfortable with hiding and unhiding edges so to visibly right this whole thing is is an illusion but visibly i want to go into this tabletop select these edges hide them select these edges and hide them and then turn my hidden geometry on and off set make sure you have a keyboard shortcut for that you can you can find it through uh the view menu or uh but it you're i'm not even sure where it is because i have keyboard shortcut for so long anyway keyboard shortcuts it it's super important because let's take these two assemblies let's move them over and now we want to extend the tabletop let's say i move that let me move it exactly 4 in now i want to extend this tabletop 2 in but i've hidden the edges so when i go to select these edges or this surface or to push pull this surface there's nothing to select nothing i can grab if i turn on hidden geometry i can go in select those edges move them by 2 in or later on if i needed to move these together again if i have hidden uh hidden geometry turned off and i go to move this i mean i can move it but i can't move it from this edge uh so i it's hard for me to grab this i i may be able to grab a point but if i turn h geometry on though it's easy to grab that edge and move it over so with this method do become comfortable with turning your hidden geometry on and off and being able to select geometry and hide it or show it as needed but that's kind of that's the idea it's it's more of depending on how you to work this may this may drive you crazy and and you there's no way um that you wouldn't want to use names and and be more meticulous and and build out a full set of components but if you also just to say you know what i i want to commit to creating six iterations six design different iterations that i can then take you know one of these and say this one i'm going to make you know this one out here and then this one i'm going to make a few tweaks on it is a quick way to go in and just do that just be non-committal be loose with i know i'm just take this and this and move those in another two ines and take this tabletop move it out because we're extending the sides and now i can evaluate that it's not that it's that it it doesn't take a whole lot of time if you've set this up properly but it's just it's a really fast really to me sketchy paper way to do this um again it's not going to work in all situations it it but it can be kind of just an approach you take and then you get a mess this but that's the point okay um let me know probably for some of you you're you're just go let me have it go type it out and be this is the worst approach and you're going to confuse people and you have messy models and you can never them with anybody because you've created a whole weird assembly of groups and components yeah all that's true all that's true um but i i doing it for just iterations just fast iterations to me it helps me i say just be non-committal and uh and treat this a sketching exercise i do i i will i will have to spend time when i find one that i to kind of rebuild it or fix it into a more robust model that's part of the process but that's why i say it's it's just kind of a different philosophical approach so if you hate it that's it's okay if you want to try it please try it if you have your own weird rule breaking scenarios let me know what those are because again sketchup you you kind of can do a whole lot of things with it and you can get in a lot of trouble but that's up to you so thanks you all um do and if you haven't and we'll see you next time bye [music]
