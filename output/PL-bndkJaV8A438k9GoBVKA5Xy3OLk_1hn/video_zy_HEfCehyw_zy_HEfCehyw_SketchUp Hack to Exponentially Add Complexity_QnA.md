##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at how to use components to make complex looking models really quick we have made a fair number of videos on components and i think that the the you know we've talked about editing one you edit them all and uh keeping your model organized that kind of thing um but one of the things that they do is they do help you to create geometry fast so what we're going to do is in a fairly quick amount of time we're going to go from having nothing to having something that's logical step right but we're going to talk about uh uh you know building out or or bolstering up a model quickly and easy using a couple of components and we're going to do that right now all right so the thing i want to create i want to create a building this is going to be kind of a a context building maybe it's not a hero building but something that's going to look you know it would be appropriate to be in the background of a model or something that uh that sort of thing so what i'm going to do is i'm going to start with a rectangle i'm just make this uh 40 feet by 40t and then i'll take that and we'll pull it up 50 feet okay so in the realm of context uh i could have this build building on a street corner and you would know that it represents a building but it's not really awesome looking it's it's it's a square it's a rectangle and it looks that the reason to go and put in a whole bunch of details on context buildings is because we want our building to shine and because it takes a lot of time and energy so what i want to do is come in here and maybe without spending a lot of time and energy still get this thing looking kind of cool so uh i'll triple click and make this into a group this is just kind of the the canvas for our components we're about to create and then i'm going to come in here and i'm going to put a window in right about that is height not not not precision modeling by any means here but just uh something to look good right so all right so there's a window on the side there uh i'll go ahead and offset to get a sill kind of that and then uh i'll pull that up and i'm pull the glass out slightly too something that uh you know let's do this let's let's make the bottom let's bring a sill out that okay that looks pretty cool pretty simple i'm grab that i'm going to make a component i'm going to call it a window and then i'm going to take a copy of that and bring it across to here and say i don't know divide by four yeah that was good okay so and then i'm going to take those four and i'm going to say we'll actually here as well move it up 10 feet and do that four times there we go all right so pretty quick pretty easy we have uh you know a a set of windows there um let's go ahead and take all of those windows and we're going to make them into a new component and i'm going to call this facade i'm going to take that component then and i'm going to rotate it i'm going to rotate it from the middle of this building this is a square on top so i'm going to go to there option to here say 3x that's going to put three copies on one on each side and the cool thing is because this is a component i can make changes inside of an individual window but then also elsewhere inside of here so a couple things we're going to do um let's let's go a little bit beyond what we have with this window let's i'm going to come in here zoom in and i'm going to put a little rectangle that and maybe we'll just pull that right across that maybe we'll push this bottom section in a little i want to go all the way into the wall so you know it is a a fake thing setting out there okay that's kind of cool may i'll pull this out a little more or i don't know making geometry up and then let's do something on the top too let's do let's do something pull this up pull this out here in here get rid those extra edges and then maybe we'll pull this out and then i'll take this edge right here and pull it out a little bit so i get a little bit yeah that's kind of cool um let's also grab these two edges scale those out i'm playing a little bit here i'm i don't have an exact vision for what i want but i want something looks little more interesting than just a rectangle on the side that's great and because i have a component again they all get updated let's keep going let's let's add some more things here let's i'm going to come in here and i'm going to put a rectangle here and here and here and here and i'm being a little bit half hazard here but uh i'll pull each of these out just a little bit just to give the the look of that one actually came over a little too far so we push this one back that there we go but look how quickly i've created more depth and interest on my building um this is i i get this is looking a little bit slap dash but you get the you get the idea so quick and easy way to do that the other thing i can do i'm going to exit out one layer so i'm still in the big component so in the big component i can do something this come in here i'm going to draw a rectangle that i'm going to pull that out that far pull that over this far and then uh i'll option pull this up this make this a little bit deep get option pull that out that pull this over this and then pretty quick and easy you know just did that we did it on one side and then it shows up on all the other sides if i want to clean that up i can always come in here shift and erase a couple of these extra edges this to make it look they connect back together that looks pretty cool that's pretty quick pretty easy um let's take that just a little bit further i'm going to come in here and uh i'm going to come into this window i'm actually going to move this over a little bit more and move this over here this because i want to put something down the corners here um that guy back too and then come in here again outside of the window i'm just in the in the main piece here and i'm going to draw a rectangle that is draw a rectangle not a line not an edge rectangle that big and then a rectangle that big pull this one oops reverse my faces reverse faces and then i'm going to pull this one out this far this one's going to come out not quite as far and then i will take that and i want to put that over on the other side so what i need to do is i'm going to draw an edge this draw a line straight down and then back up i have a 45¬∞ surface so i can grab that i can say mirror that copy of that over to here perfect and now i can just pull this over here pull this over here and i do some quick clean up delete delete my extra edges that's always a good idea i don't need all that extra geometry and then what i can do is i could come in i don't need this anymore i could come in and make this a component i don't really need to do that though um i don't here go gra that again and turn off these extra edges right there um what i can do is i can say option copy this down to there and we want to do that maybe i don't know 30 times 40 times there 40 40 was good and then come down here to the bottom and just get rid of this extra geometry all this and because we put it on the corner as a component oops i should i really should have checked the top of that quick better than i did um say here and say orient faces get all those clicked back up but because i put that in in the the overall component on one edge it did it all four sides that so that's finished kind of quick i think the only other thing i really want to do is i want to add some additional some randomness right because it looks very uniform but i mean here in just a couple minutes eight minutes we got this all in here but let's go add some randomness so not in the window group but on the outside in the the main component group i'm going to draw a couple of boxes something this and then maybe something that and i'm going to grab all that make that into a new component boxes and then i'm going to grabb move i'm going to hit my option twice to go into stamp i'm going to click here and now i'm just going to go around and on a couple of window sills just drop this in here not probably not in the same place on each one but you know just moving around a little bit uh just to give it i said a little bit of additional texture a little something else on there and i could do this with a couple different shapes but uh you know just two or three three shapes just to show something a little bit different so it's not perfectly the same on every side so now if i click out you can see okay i got all that geometry so not bad for less than 10 minutes of modeling we have what is i mean a pretty detailed looking model with some some depth to it i didn't even do colors in here but we could have done the same thing we could have put initial base coat here and i could have different brick colors it could have done windows um but you can see just how quick components make something an extruded rectangle look a complete building so that's something that works i mean we did it for i said it's kind of a context probably wouldn't be a hero building but maybe something you know out next to your your main hero building something that but you can use components to quickly take details and repeat them so any situation you have where you have repeating geometry components can make it real easy to make that happen fast um this happened said we did this in the context of a building and some architectural model or or urban planning or something that but there's lots of examples of how you could do that in other things any place where something repeats components are a great way to make short work of modeling um if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below how do you use components have you used components for something this what are other use cases that you think something this would help where you could go in and quickly create a bunch of geometry using components one time uh i would love to hear that or and if you have another idea that you think would make a good video something we haven't covered or something we'd to see covered again let us know about that too we making these videos a lot but we them even more when showing something you want to see thank you [music]
