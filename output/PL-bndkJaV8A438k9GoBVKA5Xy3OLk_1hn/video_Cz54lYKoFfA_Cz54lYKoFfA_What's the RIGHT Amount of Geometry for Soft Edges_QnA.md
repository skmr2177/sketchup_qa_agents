##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: what's the right amount of geometry for soft edges in sketchup? video id: cz54lykoffa playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz54lykoffa uploader: sketchup duration: 661 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:04:28.674817 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today we're going to take a look at making things look soft so softness is a tactile thing right it's it's something you have to touch you have to touch something to re to realize its softness you can't taste hear or smell softness you have to touch it um when we talk about things in a 3d model we can make things look they're soft and we do this by things adding textures or or colors to that that maybe reflect less light indicates that they're not hard or when we're talking about geometry 3d geometry it's things rounding off corners so let's take a look at how to quickly and easily make something look softer than it actually is all right so i got a couple of cubes right here they're not actually cubes they're boxes they're not the same size on all sides so what we're going to do is we're going to look at how to make these corners look a little bit softer we have a couple options here um i'm also going to mention maybe some extensions that can help you with this too but uh there's one principle in particular which is using the soften and smooth edges dialogue that's going to help with smoothing geometry so there's one easy way to make this look soft i have these nice crisp 90¬∞ corners here um and we're going to take a look at how do we go about actually making these three edges look less prominent let make it softer uh i'm going to do this real quick using an arc so i'm going to come in here i'm going to throw an arc right here this is going to be an exaggerated example so we're going to make this nice and big so here's an arc i'll push pull that down there we go knock off that corner go back into my arc put another arc right here on this edge that grab this edge this edge and this edge going to go to tools go to me and click on that there we go so now we got these nice soft edges i could come in here and i could get rid of these extra lines around here to make this look even softer and got there we go so there we go so now obviously very nice very soft this is this is big obviously i went with this nice big round corner um but we can do this without adding all of that the other thing we did do there is if i turn on show hidden geometry i can see i added a lot to this so what was originally what's this 18 entities is now 582 entities so you can see this this looks great but it added some geometry to our model it's also exaggerated i said this is way out there if i'm just trying to knock off a corner i'd probably want to use arcs that are maybe you know just a fraction of the size just a little teeny cut off the corner cut off the corner but you can see it does a lot there so one of the things you can do i could do this right now is i can just grab these three edges right here and i can sell it to make that soft and smooth and when i do that we got to turn off my hidden hidden geometry though uh you can see it gets rid of those lines so it can kind of start to suggest uh softness this is a little bit crazy right this is this is actually looks it just hid lines it didn't necessarily soften stuff so much um but there's other things i can do to make that kind kind of give that same softness without going through the process of adding a whole bunch of geometry or including you know a bunch of extra steps so one of the things i to do is i will grab two edges this or this could work on all four sides but we're going to try to emulate the same thing here and i'm going to offset these yeah that much yeah a half inch do exactly half inch i don't know what size this box is but i'm using a half inch all right so i'm going to do that on all of these sides i'm i'm picking a half inch because i want it to be the same on all three sides you take that one two offset that5 okay so now we've we've offset all of them now i can take this face and i can actually use move to just pull that out i don't want to go out a full half well i guess if i do a half inch there i'll get let's go let's go 0.25 so pull that out i'm going perpendicular to the face 025 enter and we'll do the same thing here pull it this way 0.25 enter and i grab this one pull it up 25 enter and then what i can do is i can grab that geometry right there and again actually we can just grab it all grab every bit of that thing and say soften it so there we go we got a more realistic soft edge and right now if i grab all that 27 enties versus 231 let's turn our hidden geometry on we get a true count 582 entities versus 39 entities so big difference in the amount in the quantity there i'm going to argue that you know for a lot of examples this is probably fine for an architectural model for retail model this is probably more than enough to sell that this is a soft corner in some cases i said depend on how i'm using this right if i'm if i'm zoom way back this well yeah they no big difference no big deal right um obviously if if this thing is it's a jewelry box or something that and it is the main stage and they going to render and that kind of thing sure yeah go high detail this but if we're looking for efficient modeling and ways to just soften the corners to make it look less pointy this is more than enough and again in some cases maybe just softening or hiding hiding a single corner hiding an edge is enough so over here have a couple examples uh same thing very similar here i have a couch cushion so if i look at this couch cushion all by itself see there yeah looks really nice if i look at all the geometry in there is big it's heavy over here again i'm going say comparable you know from from where we're looking at it not a big difference this piece right here and see i just knocked off one corner i didn't even do two i did in the other one so a fraction of the geometry so you can actually see it here right you can see all the extra edges all the extra lines versus here just getting a slight knockdown and then soften and smooth what's the difference i mean when when we actually get into it so two things there's two things one is that when you do soften with a whole lot of edges this you do get more control over the shadow so look at see as i as i move my camera around you can see this shadow how it follows that curve it does look better so if i'm up close if i'm you know i don't know why but if i was doing a render of the arm of the couch that makes sense put it that over here i have less control it turns all white and i get some cases some weird overly dark corners that kind of stuff i have less control over it's less smooth because i have less surfaces that sketchup is running that light across when i have something this sketchup knows okay light break light break light break at every one of those edges every one of those hidden brakes it's going to smooth the light into the next face over here where we have just these two it goes okay light from here smears into here light from here smears into here and that's it so we get a lot less uh smooth light right here so it just kind of jumps jumps because it's smoothing across three surfaces here rather than all of these surfaces here so you do have a little bit more uh control over those shadows if you break it up this you're more likely to get uh you know hard shadows on soft geometry if you don't do something that but you can see again depending what you're doing is it worth coming in and adding all this super heavy geometry for a couch it's going to sit in the back and i'm going to see it this in a render probably not if i'm in here and uh you know i'm looking at a living room and this is the center piece of the living room okay yeah maybe in that case but uh it's up to you it's really i mean i'm here to show you options i'm showing you options uh yeah high poly low poly either way can be smoothed the quality of the smoothness is going to depend depend on how much geometry you want to put in there and how much work you want to put into it one of the other things to mention of course is this doesn't have to all be done manually i don't have to do this couch the same way i did this block here with multiple steps i can use extensions fredo corner or mindsight studios bevel something that to get a bunch of these smooth corners at the same time but the fact is at the end depending on the amount of geometry you put in there you're going to end up with a heavier model but again more control over how that light falls across those smooth corners so i said options but uh something to note that all it takes to go from being a hard 90¬∞ angle to being what could be a soft geometry is something as simple as softening an edge again if you're taking something that same sofa we had and it's going to be this big in the corner of your model you might just not even knock the corners off you might just selectively soften a few edges just to make the front look it's soft uh it's up to you but you don't have to go to the point of modeling every single crease in geometry that's in a in a piece of furniture something that you can get away with just hiding and softening specific faces i hope that helps if so go ahead and click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please do leave us a down below uh how do you go about this sort of thing are do you have to do this do you ever soften anything do you have another tip you think would make a good video or do you run into a problem that you'd us to help you answer if so let us know in the comments you making these videos a lot but we them even more we in the showing i was almost out it was my last line we making these videos a lot we even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
