##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about how to model a ring so what am i talking about when i talk about ring i'm talking about jewelry i'm talking about some just basic band type geometry we get a lot of questions requests to model specific things some of these things are enormous aircraft carriers uh um various planes vehicles trucks uh we appreciate it keep it coming um a lot of these things are big they be difficult days of modeling weeks of modeling to actually get done so let's kind of fall off one end on the other hand we get some things which are fairly basic quick easy to see how they work uh models in those cases we do want to make videos of that so this is a question that's actually come up a couple times to show me how to model a ring um i don't know exactly that's that's the whole question that's the whole request so not details in there about you know is there fancy things so i figured we'd start with simple simple modeling we're going to go through and look how to model something my wedding band uh we're going to actually do that right now all right so i'm not going to go through the process of you know on camera taking my band off my fingers and measuring this with calipers i did that off camera and i just have a couple of numbers here so the inside of my ring is 18 mm the outside of my ring is about 20 mm so it's about 2 mm wide and then i just got a little cross-section of the shape here it's about 7 mm tall and it kind of has this you know slopes that and then it's almost a flat spot of about a millimeter on either end so it kind of kind of slopes up a little bit and then slopes so kind of a a d shape that we want to make so want to make all this so first things first i want to model this in the middle in the the values that are here so it's in millimeters i'm not going to actually model in millimeters several of you have mentioned this or mentioned this in videos before sketchup was made to model architectural model so it really works best when we're working at hous size objects we can go smaller of course but something real small we want to get a lot of detail in i'm going to want to go to uh model at a larger scale and then shrink down for output so what i'm going to do is i am going to go pull up my model info i'm going to go into my units and i want to model everything in meters so what i'm going to do is i'm going to one for one me everything so 18 millimet is going to be model as 18 m and then i can just take the final thing and scale it down so couple questions here learning aside this is going to be a nice learning process of figuring out how to create this exact geometry but why would i model something this i'm i want to model this not why would i model it but what's my purpose i want to model this in such a way that maybe i could build off this and create a cast for you know a 3d printing model where i could take it maybe print it out of wax and then cast it in metal um something along those lines that's what i'm looking to do here i want to get enough detail that if i was to make this into a real thing in the real world it would work it would look nice and smooth i don't want to be heavy fasted so i'm going to be real high on my poly count but to get out a good looking ring model so let's do that so first thing i'm going to take my image and i'm just going to move it off to the side a little bit um i'm going to say goodbye to teddy we don't need teddy right now and the reason i'm doing that is anytime i work off of something circular if i can i to work off the origin because when i look at this ring the center here the middle this is going to be negative space right so i don't have a point that i can use as reference if i was modeling a square i to grab a lower left corner and put that at the origin in the case of a circle if i can align it to the middle that's that's the easiest for me so when i grab come up here i'm going to grab my circle and i'm going go to the very middle and what i'm going to do is i'm going to pull it out um half of this inside dimension so it's it says 18 so what i'm going to do is i'm going to pull it out uh 9 m um before i do that though well let's let's let's go ahead and do it i'm going to do it nine enter and there we go um i kind of lost my image there my picture where'd it go let's scoot that over even more let's just stick around here there's not there many dimensions on here but let's go pull it out again so nine enter and there we go that's 9 m so now you can tell if if i was to take this say i was to send this to 3d print or something that i that this very faceted look right um it's possible on the outside maybe that's a cool look for the outside of my ring and i want that for the inside i probably want it nice and smooth so if i pull my entity info it's 24 edges right now so generally speaking i try to work in increments of 12 so a low poly circle would be 12 something where i don't care was just for visualization 24 but if i'm outputting a circle that's going to be printed i usually jump to 48 or in this case i'm going to go to 96 sides and you can see that's a much smoother circle if i zoom way in here i can still eventually see the facets but for my purposes shrunk down to you know less than 20 millim that's going to work just fine speaking of 20 millim um i could have set that first too when i come in circle initially before i type anything else i can just tell that i want 96 sides and i could draw it that was for illustrative p purposes i did that that way all right so if i look in here my exterior my width of the wall wall is 20 i'm not going to do that here so what this is what this piece right here is this is my path that i'm going to use for me to actually put the geometry in i'm going to just make this shape sitting on the outside of my my path so my overall height of the wall of my ring so this is just a cross-section right through here is seven so what i'm going to do is i'm going to come right here i'm going to go up 3.5 the overall width of the wall is two so from here i'm just going to come over two come back down seven then i can actually use inferencing to just hold down shift and snap to there to there all right so if i was to trace this around if i used me and said trace a circle i'd have real basic ring shape that would work out awesome so in my ring this first uh one so half this this is this is two this is 1 millim to here 1 millimeter to here the second millimeter from here down to here is one great arc so i'm going to do it's it's a great arc i don't know why i said that that way but it is it's really something all right so i'm just going to come down there to middle to middle and pull that out to the front there so again same thing here this arc is six segments so the whole the whole thing was 12 i might bump that up maybe i'd say that's 12 just give me a little bit more a little more smoothness this is going to create a lot of geometry but again the interest here is i'm creating a hero prop this is a thing that is going to you know look awesome by itself this maybe something is going to get rendered or i said output for 3d printing all right over here um i'm going to create another arc i'm trying to figure out exactly how far down i want to put it uh this part is a little real small i couldn't pull a caliper on this thing so here's how do i'm going to come down 0 five and then from that point i'm going to draw another arc from here straight across to where it intersects this previous arc and then pull that up that wasn't quite right be a little higher to get tangent tangental so let's try going up .1 mim and then i'll draw another arc from that point this is that was not the right point one oh i said1 millimeter undo undo i i faked myself out there all right 0.1 enter there we go so now i'll draw from there where it meets there that's that is good enough i'm happy with that all right so then i'm going to take this shape right here i want to get that exact same shape on the the bottom so i'm going to grabb that little chunk just the chunk that's going to get cut off right here and i'm going to say mirror that my modifier key to copy grab blop trace it down here boom that and then i'm going to erase these extra edges and that is a pretty good look profile for my ring all right last step here um just to make this easier i'm going to get rid of the surface cuz all i need is this ring i don't actually need the face in there uh i'm going to grab that i'm going to go to tools and say me and then just click this shape and there we go get rid of this on the inside that is a very good representation of what my ring looks awesome last thing i'm going to triple click so you can see how many faces in here i said this is going to be nice and smooth when i 3d print it that's going to look look perfect that's going to look awesome this is too much if i was i mean if this was supposed to be i don't know the end of a turbine is what's coming to mind something that it's a lot of geometry i wouldn't want to do this for a full-size model especially if this is repeating but for this being a hero prop makes a lot of sense so i'm going to go ahead and make it a component let's call my ring now i'm just going to take it make a copy over here there's the full height full size one i want to go from meters to millimeters so i'm going to go scale start dragging it down one corner to the opposite corner so it's a uniform rescaling and say 0.001 enter uh i want to lose that where'd it go oh it's tiny there we go zoom in zoom in zoom in there we go all right so with that i can right hck if i hit scale definition that's going to set it so it's not a scaled version now that's the actual size that it is and this is this the file i would want to use to export this to 3d print because this is the proper size this is what i want to actually if i was to print this it should fit on my finger just my current wedding ring does and that would be it so there we go quick and easy ring in sketchup so yeah i said that was that was a request and i know i went deep i went step by step and explained a lot of stuff um realistically it's probably a few minutes to get that modeled pretty quick and quick and easy with all that detail um but hopefully those who asked show me how to model a ring that works for you if there's more specifics you had in there some spe you know i mean modeling jewelry can be a big deal i talked about an aircraft carrier taking a lot of time to a real fancy nice looking ring and that kind of thing that could that could take some energy and some time but uh if there's specifics you'd want to see in here let me know about that and if there's other things you think would be great to see modeled in you know whatever we have 10 15 minutes here let me know about that too down in the comments below if you haven't already do give us a down below if you that and please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you and i said most importantly let us know in the comments what you think is there something else we should show is there something else a specific thing we should model tell us in the comments mak these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
