##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to take a look at combining two landscape meshes so this is actually a question i saw on the forum and i've seen it come up several times before so regardless of how you get these meshes if this is from ad location or imported files something that it's it's probably a never situation that you would have two pieces that directly perfectly aligned together at the edge and just merge perfectly um we're going to look at a couple different ways to go in and make these meshes line up uh and ranging in simplicity from time consuming but not complex to maybe take a look at an extension let's check it out all right so when i'm talking about meshes this is what i'm talking about so right here we have actually looks some some i don't know wded up pieces of paper or something but these are actually landscapes these are nice nice big chunks of landscape and each of these just i have three copies they're both made up of two meshes so i have one mesh that goes here one mesh that goes here if you look right at the edge you can kind of see where they don't quite overlap perfectly but uh you can tell by the bounding boxes that they are lapping past each other so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to go to view and turn on my hidden geometry that's going to give me since i have this nice smooth out space this is going to give me some real uh geometry interact with now there's a couple different types of meshes you might get in here this is what's called an ordered mesh you can see uh if i look at it straight from above it looks i have just you know same same size rectangles diagonally connected uh and that's what makes up the mesh as opposed to a mesh where i have you know different shapes triangles rectangles whatever just connecting geometry together to get a smoothing smooth geometry uh but in this ordered mesh um i can kind of see where the two overlap i can see that it doesn't line up perfect right so the edge doesn't line up and then where they actually lap over each other you can see one mesh they kind of fight for which one's on top you know one over the other fact we can we can exaggerate this a little bit by uh let's just put some colors on here i put two different colors you can see real well that they're kind of rising above and below each other so that's not ideal i mean depending what you're doing here if you had uh you know terrain projected over this or something that you might not even notice that but if what your goal is is i don't know maybe maybe you're excavating and need a a measurement or something that or i'm turning this all into a solid for some reason this setup's not ideal having these two pieces lap over each other aren't great i would want to have these two pieces tied together so we're going to look at how to go about that so the first thing i said these are two meshes these are two separate pieces so we're going to get them to tie together uh do two different ways we're do the first way we're going to start doing it by hand and i'll show you exactly how that works it's not complicated it's a little time consuming but you'll see it and then we'll uh we'll take a look at an extension option as well i know this is level up sketchup where we stick in sketchup and usually extensions kind of fall in the uh beyond desktop but i have no butt but that's what we're doing so so there we go all right so if i look at these two um what i want to do is i want to get rid of some of the me i don't want overlap what i want to do is create a situation where one ends and then i have the next one starts what i'm do is i'm going to double click into this top one and i'm going to do a select um it comes up just shy of this line here so was kind of that all right all right so i selected everything up below this line and then i'm just going to hit delete all right so what the what that created was a gap between the two right so that looks pretty good and you can actually kind of see this is i mean this is fairly close these meshes are not too far off but they are not perfect once i have that gap i'm going to select and actually you know what here i'm going to do this i'm going to get rid of these two over here i'm going grab these two because i want to do the same thing so i'm just going to option copy those over there that way for the next solution uh i'll start with the same on the same step so once i have them both i'm going to select them and i'm going to explode them now we're to look at two different ways to to get this uh knitted together first way oh some of you already knew this was coming is to stitch and by stitch i mean draw a line between each of these points just connecting the geometry together geometry you know what i was talking about geometry together this and this is it this is called stitching and i have talked about before that uh i tend to find this kind of soothing this is it's repetitive it is not complicated it is boring uh so if you if you you know if you're if you're a real busy busy person you're busy designer getting stuff done stitching might be an opportunity for you to just zen out relax be cool that kind of thing um so you can see it's not difficult but this is this is solid uh you know this is solid intern work right here this is not fun to do this is not a great way to spend a lot of time i'm not going to do the whole thing i'm going to do a chunk once that's in there you can grab my grab the eraser option smooth all these edges i just created and there we go and then once i actually i'll shift erase this so it matches the other edges and now if i come in here to uh view and turn my hidden geometry off that's all going to lock together just as smooth as the rest of it perfect um that is one way to do that and i said i don't know two three minutes a couple minutes of stitching would be get that all done um i'm not going to make you watch that that's boring that's not that's not fun so the other way i could do this is turn hidden geometry back on again is going to be to use the move command so if i come into to move and i have nothing highlighted i can move over a point i can click on that point and now that point is connected to my cursor and now i can grab that point and i bring it up and click it to uh another existing point sometimes this gets a little finicky i'll be honest i've i've played with this and i've had the most uh success for whatever reason when i do these meesh is is grabbing it from the underside and trying to connect it together i have zero clue why i struggle to do this from above but it's fairly easy from below but that's what happens sometimes you when you try to move points this you'll end up having to force it to move in an xy or z so on one of the colored axes um using the uh arrow keys so it's possible you'll hit something that but you see it's it's this again not difficult but really it's pretty simple it's not there's not there's not again time consuming yeah mind- numbing maybe a bit but difficult no not difficult uh it just takes a little bit when you're done the big difference of course is your order right you you have you still maintain that kind of ordered mesh whereas over here i ended up with this odd section and i actually jumped here and i i changed the direction of my diagonals whereas this looks a little bit different so you can see again view hidden geometry you can see those two pieces stitch up either way it gets you this nice smoothness but i said and this is a fairly big plot of land too uh not a ton of fun so what about using an extension to do this let's hop over here i'm going to explode these two just i did before so there's a couple of lofting tools out there the one of my favorites is curval loft uh from fredo great way to go in and just fill this all in at once what i need for curve off to work though is an edge i need an edge on both sides and then curve off will stitch it together so i don't have an edge here so when i look at this mesh right now this is so this this is an ad location mesh this was pulled in from add location so when i double click on it uh i'm going to actually go in view and turn on my hidden geomet omry and now i'm going to double triple click excuse me select it all and if i go to soft and smooth edges um i'm going to turn off all smoothing additionally i have to go up to entity info and turn all visibility on so edges inside so i'm just going to grab one edge it is smoothed but it is also invisible so to get it to come back i have to select it turn visibility on and then un soften and smooth it obviously this isn't ideal this is not what i want so i'm going to i'm going to triple click both of them and then i'm going to res smooth them so that those inside lines disappear but i still have my outside edges because what i'm going to want to do now i'm going to turn view turn my hing geometry off i just need to tell it i'm going to have this edge and this edge loft together and we've done several videos on curve aoft you haven't seen it search our channel there's a bunch of these but i'm just going to go in here to fredo 6 collection i'm going to go to cur aoft and i am going to curve loft by spline i'm going to grab this edge and this edge hit do it all right and that creates a new surface connecting the two together when it creates it it creates in its own group so i'm going to select it and explode it that should join it all together we click one last time toggle soft and smooth on and there we go now i have that in one piece you saw how saw how quick that goes uh kind of a testament to this is a perfect example of extensions yeah there's a manual way to do it but invest in an extension and you might uh save yourself some carpal tunnel not too much clicking there but there you go a couple of quick and easy ways to take multiple trains and combine them into one so hopefully that uh is helpful to you and uh if you've ever run into this with imported meshes i guess it doesn't have to be terrain we use we this this example happen to come from terrain but anytime you have flowing meshes that merge into each other um you could also do some stuff with intersect and that kind of thing the problem with intersect tyson just did a video on intersect which is awesome showed how how intersect with selection works um if you have two meshes that literally cross over each other that works great for intersect the problem with this is our two meshes we saw remember when we had color coded they kind of lapped above and below each other so intersect would have created some weirdness it would have created a bunch of pieces where i have to go and i'd have to select and delete different chunks and pieces it wouldn't have worked well it wouldn't have been smooth uh my connection would not have been good that so if if i have meshes that cross over each other perfect for intersect if they're butting up against each other that uh you got to go with something lofting or a little bit of stitching if you that video go ahead and click down below and if you haven't already please do what i would love to see though is a let me know if you've run into something this maybe you have a better way of going about this maybe there's a system that you've come up with that is even better i would love to hear about it down in the comments below or if you've never run into this and there's a different situation you hit inside of sketchup and you want to get some advice on how to deal with it let me know that too we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
