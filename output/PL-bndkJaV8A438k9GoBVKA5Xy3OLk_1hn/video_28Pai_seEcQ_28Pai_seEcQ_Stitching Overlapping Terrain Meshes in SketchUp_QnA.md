Here are the Q&A pairs based on the provided transcript:

**Q:** How do I make two overlapping meshes line up perfectly?
**A:** To align two overlapping meshes, you can use the Follow Me tool to extrude a curved profile along the circular path. Select the path first, then click the profile. Alternatively, you can use the Stitching method by drawing a line between each point of geometry together.

**Q:** What is the difference between using the Stitching method and an extension like Curval Loft?
**A:** The Stitching method involves manually connecting points of geometry together to create a smooth connection. On the other hand, an extension like Curval Loft uses a loft tool to stitch together two meshes by creating a new surface in its own group.

**Q:** How do I use the move command to connect two meshes?
**A:** To use the move command, select a point on each mesh and click on it to grab it. Bring one point to the other point and click to create a connection between them. This method can be finicky, but it works well for some cases.

**Q:** Can I use intersect to combine two overlapping meshes?
**A:** Intersect is not suitable for combining two overlapping meshes with lapped edges, as it would create multiple pieces that need to be selected and deleted. Instead, use a method like lofting or stitching (with manual connection) to achieve a smooth connection.
