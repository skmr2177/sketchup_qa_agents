##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: practice finger joints | -along sketchup exercise video id: yjcqqaeyqta playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjcqqaeyqta downloaded: 2025-07-18t15:30:19.405699 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- kind: captions y'all my name is tyson and this time around&nbsp; let's just do some uh a basic practice exercise together so recently i've done some videos&nbsp; that were showing uh ino's laser tools and&nbsp;&nbsp; what that does one of the things it does&nbsp; is create finger joints or box joints and&nbsp;&nbsp; that that led me to think this is just a good&nbsp; exercise being able to resolve that sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; thing and that's what we're going to do so &nbsp; along and let's practice uh some basic sketchup techniques to start we're going to draw a&nbsp; box it the size doesn't really matter if&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to be precise let's say 24 in by 30&nbsp; but that's not going to matter one thing that&nbsp;&nbsp; will matter is make it a known height so i'm&nbsp; going to say 1 in and then select this group it and then we could do uh a number of&nbsp; different ways but i'm just going to&nbsp;&nbsp; draw in the blue direction a couple of more&nbsp; segments now i could select any one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; or the corner segments and also make a copy but&nbsp; i want this to just be variable right no even spacing so when we have that i'm going to come&nbsp; in here and i'm going to push that back one inch&nbsp;&nbsp; right we raised our panel or at least i did one&nbsp; inch so whatever distance you used do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing and i'm going to add one more segment&nbsp; here and that way when i'm done i'll have uh&nbsp;&nbsp; same on either side so there that's that's our&nbsp; starting point and let's make a copy of this so&nbsp;&nbsp; we're going to copy this up and then we could&nbsp; use the move tool rotate grips or the rotate tool either way rotate a version vertical and then move&nbsp; it back back into place and what we want to&nbsp;&nbsp; do is change all of this um this panel so that&nbsp; it will match and we have the finger joints in&nbsp;&nbsp; here now again this is variable spacing and&nbsp; that's on purpose but the way that you can&nbsp;&nbsp; make this challenging for yourself is to do a&nbsp; couple things let me make one copy of this so&nbsp;&nbsp; we can do that for example in this version i'm&nbsp; going to pick a view let's just say this view&nbsp;&nbsp; right here and i'm going to resolve all of this&nbsp; without ever moving my camera now i am definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; an advocate that you should be orbiting often&nbsp; but if i move this back into place i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to challenge myself to say can i move this these&nbsp; pieces without moving my camera i should be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to and here's some of the way in which we do it&nbsp; it i can for example use push pull pull to this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh edge and then using a selection window and&nbsp; i can't really see but if i turn x-ray mode on&nbsp;&nbsp; i can see that i've selected that but this&nbsp; is also part of the exercise is to kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine your yourself being able to select a face&nbsp; using a left to right selection back here without&nbsp;&nbsp; even turning x-ray mode on and also say for over&nbsp; here we'd know that we'd get in trouble because&nbsp;&nbsp; back here we have overlapping so we'll have to&nbsp; do a little bit more work but the point is i'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to turn x-ray mode on and start moving&nbsp; this now maybe i will invoke the red inference&nbsp;&nbsp; and and this uh i wasn't careful enough you can&nbsp; see my geometry is stretching so i'm i'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to select this again check my selection move&nbsp; this into place i could use push pull or move tool so i've got all these pieces done um&nbsp; this one i said maybe from here if i&nbsp;&nbsp; select all of this geometry if i look um i've&nbsp; got a little too much back here and and again&nbsp;&nbsp; my challenge is to stay in the same view so what&nbsp; i might do is grab all of this i don't want that&nbsp;&nbsp; edge so remove that edge and move this over and&nbsp; then from there i can grab this piece move it back or i might need to create new geometry in here but again it's this is not the best&nbsp; way that we would do this we would orbit&nbsp;&nbsp; around um as we'll see but the point&nbsp; of this hopefully is just challenge&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself to do something a little&nbsp; bit okay this is not the most&nbsp;&nbsp; efficient way way um but could i still&nbsp; complete this exercise and i think to do this oh i've zoomed it in and out all right so i think we've got it by use this last&nbsp; one and we're done again the the whole point&nbsp;&nbsp; of that is to say uh can you stay in one view&nbsp; and challenge yourself to use inference locking&nbsp;&nbsp; to use x-ray mode to use uh selection methods&nbsp; and to be able to resolve that geometry uh in&nbsp;&nbsp; a you know just from one view just because it's a&nbsp; challenge just because it might introduce uh some&nbsp;&nbsp; things for you that you haven't previously&nbsp; thought to do or don't restrict yourself to&nbsp;&nbsp; one view and just say how fast can i do&nbsp; this well now that we just did this last one we might be able to use and inference lock&nbsp; to here then push pull and then grab this section&nbsp;&nbsp; move lock the red direction push pull pull so&nbsp; challenge yourself how quickly can i resolve these and lock to here inference lock reference&nbsp; that face inference lock drop past and done but doing little simple exercises this&nbsp; i find just to be really useful for improving&nbsp;&nbsp; your speed at inference locking your speed at uh&nbsp; making selections or even just making decisions&nbsp;&nbsp; on what's going to be a more efficient method&nbsp; of selecting a face with the move tool moving&nbsp;&nbsp; and locking it or using push pull turning x-ray&nbsp; on so that you can see through and make a good selection there we go it is a very simple example&nbsp; um i said but i do think it's one that if&nbsp;&nbsp; you just for practice inference locking practice&nbsp; turning your x-ray mode on and off you can see&nbsp;&nbsp; that just it's really helpful to be able to just&nbsp; switch between locking manipulating geometry with&nbsp;&nbsp; the move tool versus pushpull um turning x-ray&nbsp; mode on and off we didn't explore the ability&nbsp;&nbsp; that you can turn your component and other parts&nbsp; of the model on and off based on your editing but&nbsp;&nbsp; that too so simple exercise but one that i think&nbsp; is worth this and other things just practicing&nbsp;&nbsp; simple things just to improve your efficiency&nbsp; and and make your speed and sketchup better i&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know what do you think is this uh is&nbsp; this a a waste of time or do you think you&nbsp;&nbsp; know what try it try it a couple times maybe&nbsp; you get better at at in sing who knows let us&nbsp;&nbsp; know what you think uh and as always let us know&nbsp; if you have questions or suggestions for other&nbsp;&nbsp; topics that we can cover we'd love to have that&nbsp; conversation we'd love to take those suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp; and make them uh real so thanks as always&nbsp; please do and see youall next [music] time [music]
