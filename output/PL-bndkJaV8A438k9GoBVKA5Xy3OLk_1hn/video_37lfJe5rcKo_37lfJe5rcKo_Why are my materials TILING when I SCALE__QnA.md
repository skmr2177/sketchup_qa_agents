##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: why are my materials tiling when i scale? video id: 37lfje5rcko playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37lfje5rcko uploader: sketchup duration: 581 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:09:19.632761 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about scaling materials so when i say scaling materials what i don't mean i don't actually mean importing a material and resizing it i'm talking about when the material is applied to a surface and that surface changes what happens to the material so you have probably seen this sometimes you change geometry and it you get repeating patterns of that material other times you move geometry and stretches and i've seen this on the forum quite a few times if you don't if you're not on our forum already check it out forums. sketchup.com and uh people are getting a little bit confused about what happens when so i made a bunch of cases examples of how materials might work on a specific geometry and we're going to take a look at where when they scale versus when they tile right now all right so i have have material right here uh just to show you this was just a a face i imported this material onto so this is undistorted this is the default look we have right here then going down this way i made a bunch of boards they're 10 in by an inch by 3 ft long so that's what we got right now so this is the normal we're going to look at loose geometry then we're going to look at grouped geometry where the faces are painted and then we have grouped geometry where the container is painted so rather the faces are white but the whole container has this material applied to it so there is a difference in how they react so let's let's take a look at how this how this works all right so down here i got my loose geometry i'm going to keep this as just kind of a control i could have put a little tag on there i guess it says control uh right here um i'm just going to come in i'm going to use push pull grab this face right here and pull it look what happens see that it's repeating so i as i make this longer that materi that that material is just going to repeat again and again again because the material is exactly 3t long the material ends where this this board does so when i push pull it just keeps bringing that same material out over and over here just reapply reapply reapply and to end so if i grab all of this minus the text and i hit scale and i grab my middle handle right here and i pull it out look what happens it stretches see that so that's good to know right off the bat loose geometry and i'm doing this with the whole box this basically what this board is all these pieces but it would happen the same if i did just one one edge down there too same thing so as a face gets extended this it's going to repeat as it gets stretched with scale it is going to stretch the geometry out so this is not a super high resolution image but you can see uh that worked okay for this particular image if you have a lower quality image when you start scaling you might start seeing pixels and it might look kind of messy but that's what happen so straight loose geometry here's what we got all right let's come over here to our grouped geometry so these are this is a copy of the same group the materials were applied to the faces so first off i mean there's a couple different things we could do here right because i could i can't push pull on a group so if i go to push pull it tells me nope no push pulling so i do have to double click to open the group and then i can use push pull and i'll grab this and this probably not a surprise some of you played around with this it behaves exactly the same geometry same thing so if i was to come in here same thing grab this geometry and scale it i will get the same behavior i saw before if i do that from the outside i grab this scale it again probably not a surprise but same behavior as before so so whether i scale the geometry inside the group and i'm using group same the exactly same thing happens if it's a component if i use scale on the inside or outside of a container so a group or component it's going to stretch just it did so basically if the material is applied to the faces so that means it's actually put on the faces they behave the same now that's pretty straightforward right that's simple push pull just going to reapply that material and it's going to tile scale it's actually going to take the material and and stretch out things get a little bit different when you paint on the outside of container so those of you who don't know what i'm talking about this board was white and i just said pick that material painted it onto this board so the container has a color right now so if i look at entity info see the container is colored with the wood if i pick this one over here it says there's nothing applied cuz they're actually it's applied to the faces in this case whereas in this one over here if i come in the face has no material applied but the group does so this i said straightforward up to here and then breaks hit not so straightforward so i'm going to double click i'm going to come in here with push pull same as i did before i'm going to pull same thing happens here that makes sense again still basically if you push pull you're not going to it's never going to stretch your materials if you push pull but what happens here if i scale let's do it on the outside first to test scale and i'm going to grab this and i'm start pulling it all right scale works the same way on the outside what happens i'm going to undo that if i come in here grab this geometry and hit scale what so i have an exception now because this material is being applied to the outside it's basically being updated as i change the geometry inside just it would if i push pulled so if i scale inside of a painted container it's going to repeat this also so there are the examples um this kind of works hand inand in a message that we often repeat around here which is probably paint your faces and not a container there are some some rare situations where working with models that come in pieces where i want to paint the outside of container so the whole thing has a single color and you can switch it real quick um but in general i would say if you didn't do this so we'll just if we just stick with these workflows over here oh yeah that's a terrible illustration all right so if we just did these things here loose geometry and painted group or painted faces inside of groups you have very consistent results in fact i'm going to take that a step further and say you should really be doing just this in the middle i shouldn't have loose geometry flying around my model i shouldn't have paint on the outside of containers in general so for the most part if i create my geometry apply materials to the faces i can consistently know that if i go into that container push pull i will get repeating geometry if i scale the geometry inside or out i will stretch the material that's on there so this is kind of drives home a point that we've we've illustrated quite a few times on this channel is the best way to get the most consistent results with materials is to paint your faces and then group your geometry or you can actually do that in either order you can paint your faces then group or you can group and then go into the group and paint wait did i say that backwards paint your faces then create the group or create the group then go in and paint your faces either way works same results and they are consistent so i hope that came across that that made sense uh the results are consistent regardless so no matter which one of these situations you have the same thing happens each time it doesn't stop randomly sometimes this happens sometimes this happens it probably seems that way uh if you're not careful about your modeling um i said generally speaking just don't paint your groups and components paint the stuff that's inside of them instead and don't i mean unless it's during the modeling process you're making a piece right now and you haven't grouped it yet you really shouldn't ever have loose geometry just hanging out in your model everything should end up in a group uh or container or i'm sorry a group or a component uh sooner rather than later so if that's the case very consistent and hopefully this makes sense i said this questions come up quite a few times uh and i was surprised to find that uh you know there was a difference but it is consist consist it is the same every single time if you that video go ahead and click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below you tripped up on this before is there any have you done any experimenting and found a better way a better way to to illustrate this to yourself or remember what to do or do you have another idea that you think would make a good video leave it down in the we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing
