##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: 5 time-saving tricks using temporary geometry in sketchup video id: aqzyvrcqomi playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqzyvrcqomi uploader: sketchup duration: 578 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:03:31.320411 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about temporary reference geometry so i did a video a little while back talking about guides and the nice thing about guides is they let you put reference geometry or inferable geometry wherever you want and it never breaks other planes or edges or anything that and it's great it really is awesome but there's some times where maybe you don't have all the information to get the guide exactly where you want it or it's easier to draw temporary geometry so anyhow i have a couple of examples of situations where it's easier to draw temporary geometry and reference it rather than using guides and how to do that without messing up your model so let's take a look at that right now all right so i have this little uh this little model right here um and i'm going to go ahead and draw this in so uh first thing is this is this is so far away from being at scale um but i'm going to draw the thing that we have here it's a plate and you see the plate is uh 1 and a4 by 1 and a/4 so i'm just going to start by drawing a rectangle i'm going say 1.25 comma 1.25 5 i did it wrong all right let's try again 1.25 comma 1.25 there we go and you can see this is obviously not the right size so i'm going to go ahead and just scale that way down and then we'll slide that over here and zoom on in okay cool so there there's my plate um now it does have thickness to it but if i'm modeling something that has holes in it i will always try to model the geometry first while it's flat then take the holes out and then push pull it up otherwise if i put depth to it first then i have to put the holes on there and then i have to push pull each one down so by pulling up the plate with holes already in it i do one push pull otherwise i'm do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so going to save myself some time there all right now i have two sets of holes drilled in this plate one is at these four corners and you see they're 1516 apart both sides so i'm going to level with you and any of you watch my live streams you probably already caught this i'm not a good mather math is not my it's not my thing it's not the thing i excel at so i could break this down and do the math and figure out what 15 16 away from one and a quarter is and then divide that in half to figure out how far each of these are in but in the time it would take me to do that i could draw a piece of reference geometry that i could then just drop exactly where it needs to be so all i have to do right now is go grab a rectangle come about where i think that's supposed to be start draging it down and then just type in 1516 comma 1516 and then enter so that gives me a rectangle i don't know that it's where i need to be but i know it's the right size so what i can do now is select it and grab a midpoint here and drag it this direction to the midpoint there and then same thing drag it vertically and all i'm doing is i'm dragging along the green axis and then holding down shift and then just kind of come up here till i hit that midpoint might have to actually zoom in here there it is so now i know for a fact that these four corn are exactly where i need my circles to be so what i could do is i could come in right now and draw a circle right here and i'm just going to i don't know i'm going to yeah 11/16th is fine and then i could just put a circle at each corner this i'm going to hit an issue right here my issue now is that this circle is now two pieces because the square was in the way so i'm gonna back up a couple steps i'm gonna grab my rectangle i'm gonna drop it over here i'm going to take this piece right here my geometry i want to work in and i'm going to make it a group so now that means my geometry is separate from any other reference geometry so now when i bring this over and i go snap to the middle if i double click into my my thing right here i can see my reference geometry is grayed out so now when i come make my circles circle circle circle circle these at this is just a circle now and that reference geometry doesn't mess with it at all so i can now grab this i double click on this rectangle here delete it there we go good to go i'm going to do the same thing right now for this right here so i have a circle here that's saying you know i have a circle of circles that go around this plate and they are it is 3 and a/4 in across so what i could do instead again keeping this still in its group that's going to protect it from me goofing up and drawing any geometry where it shouldn't be i can inference this direction i can inference this direction find the middle and i could pull that up so that this is the diameter is 3/4 of an inch so i'd actually just want to pull it up half that which would be 38 so type 38 hit enter and there we go now that's nice but i could actually make this even easier on myself so i know that this is 3/4 out to out so 38 and there's 1 2 3 4 five six holes that going get drilled on that dimension so i can save myself a little bit of work by rather than drawing a circle drawing a polygon with six sides so i'll do the same thing i'll inference to the middle i'll start pulling that up i'll go up 38 and what i've done now is i've created a point where each of those circles needs to go see that see how it matches so now same thing i just come in here i draw a circle right here and then i'm going to save myself a little time i'm going to grab this one i'm going to hit option option to get into stamp click in the middle and then just click here here here here and here and if i come out here i can just get rid of that oops i got the rid of the face there we go there we go now now that i'm done with all that in ing i can go ahead and explode this piece and remember how i was saying it was easier to put all these holes into the plate beforeand before i i push pull well here's the secret to that i'm going to select the plate just the face not the edges not the circles just this middle piece i'm going hit move and then turn on my option to copy and copy it over here look what gets copied over just this piece which i can then push up to a quarter inch and not all these circles otherwise what i have to do is i'd have to go individually delete select delete select delete select delete select delete select delete which isn't terrible that was not horrible it's not the end of the world to have to do that but i did that and then one push pull two steps rather than you know those extra 12 so there you go uh the big part here i say is that inferencing geometry if you don't have the ability to pull guides off and you don't want to break your geometry just group your initial geometry draw your inference geometry over it reference it and then delete it so we could probably classify this one as ways has figured out how to be lazy and not do math and that's fine um this is also one of those things where uh you know when i'm modeling naturally and going along i don't think about this if i stop step back and go what's the most efficient way to model uh this is the kind of stuff that comes up so i'm getting you the benefit of my doing this the harder way multiple times and then bringing this back so uh yeah so something to think about if you do have inference geometry that doesn't work immediately with guides or if it's on a circle or because there is no circle guide there is no hexagon guide you can't do that sort of thing with guides so using those other shapes for inferencing uh really helpful but something you might not hit if you're you know only depending on guides so if you that video go ahead and click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you more importantly though leave us a down below let us know if you have a different hack that you use for getting inferencing and sketch up or if there's a different tool you use maybe in an unconventional way we'd love to hear it and if we it enough we might make a video out of it we making these videos a lot but we'd them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
