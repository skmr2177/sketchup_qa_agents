##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here and today i want to with you my process for automating the export of scenes directly out of sketchup so when i say automating scenes i'm kind of referring to a term that some of you are familiar with it's called batch export so basically it's i've got a bunch of scenes and i'm going to give you two different examples here in a minute of two different use cases or scenarios of why i might want to export a bunch of different scenes all at once so assuming that they the same settings or properties size and style then um this is kind of a cool way to do it so let's just get right into it i've got my model here um it's a model of a coffee shop and i've got some scenes set up so i want to just kind of show you a couple things really quick before we get right into exporting process so number one i've got all my scenes set up i've got one with everything turned on in this case just a roof plan or plan view with x-ray so i can kind of see through it got another one where it looks i've got a section cut i can toggle that on and off not really important just letting you know that this is kind of me saving what i think is is you know the general views that i think tell the story of this little coffee shop that i built so again looking at the sort of section perspective elevation plan and axonometric so i'm done sort of setting up everything i'm done styling everything i the way it looks and i want to export first thing you'll notice is when i've click back and forth between these scenes they go pretty quickly that's because i've turned off my scene animation so under model info and over here to animation i turn off by default i just disable this i know some people to be able to see those if i turn that on and then i click between slides i click between say that you can see what it does is it actually moves the camera now that's a cool effect and sometimes you want that if you're doing a flyr or something this but in this case i don't i'm just going to go and turn that off so that's what i've done the second thing i want to do is make sure that i'm starting on my left slide here my left scene because what i'm going to do is when it batch exports it's going to go kind of left to right just you're reading a book so that's all i really needed to check was just make sure that i turned off that scene um those scene transitions so now the traditional way to do it if we're going to compare the process i would come over here to file export and in this case i'm going 2d graphics so i want to go to powerpoint or i want to go to indesign or maybe i would send some into layout um i just want to grab an image of this so let's go i would name this one a axonometric or axo double check the size settings make sure i'm using my view size 1080p um thereabouts click okay and export and there it is so if i check my file there's my export now i want to do that times 1 2 3 4 5 six however many i have here eight but i also do want to do this in a separate file so anytime i can speed the process up even even if it's just by five or six seconds and you times that by 20 or by 30 or by 50 or however many scenes you have in your model that could save a lot of time so let's try this different way i'm going to go file same thing export this time instead of going to 2d graphic i'm going to pop down here to animation now what you'll notice under options is that you get some different settings you do get the resolution so i can change that to a custom resolution or because it's thinks you're animating to a video well that's kind of what animation is set up for you can see that it's using these sort of hd or 720p resolution i'm going to leave it as the 1920 that's what i wanted anyway so what i want to do is also double check right here the frame rate so if you're doing an animation you would have something 24 or even 30 frames per second as you transition from one scene to another but in this case actually i'm wanting to export the views to be used in presentation an in design or a powerpoint so i actually don't want multiple frames um there's no key framing so in this case all i want to do is do one frame per second and that means that each scene i have in my model will export to one static image on my drive so i'm going to go ahead and click this first one and i'm just going to call this batch export um scenes of course i can call this coffee shop model and call it whatever i want i'm just going to do this as my test and i'm going to click export and as it's going there you can see what's happening here on my drive it's exporting everything all at once so what i'm going to do is grab those i'm going to go ahead and open these up just to show you and there they are axo plan plan section uh perspective and of course going down the list and there they all are so pretty cool that i was able to get that many views out all at once and of course if i change something if i toggle a tag on and off or i change my default style it's as simple as just going back to the sketchup model and the same thing if i wanted to replace all of those i would just go file export and do that process all over again and in just literally less than 30 seconds all of my scenes have been exported now that's uh that's this is where i wanted to give you an example of where if i had all the styles and all the shadows and all the tags set per scene that would be really useful most this is most how most of us work is we get all of our scenes looking exactly the way we want but i did a video recently about exporting to sketch so basically exporting to something photoshop where i would draw over it in which case i actually it's less important about knowing where all my scenes are going to be and it's more important that i have different styles set up for each scene so in this case i've got my color by tag which represents the colors um associated with the tags in the model the organ the way i've organized it i have just black and light white line work which i always to to have just a black and white model i have x-ray sometimes i'll use x-ray if i want to be able to kind of soften something or give some transparency or see through it it's just stylistically a cool option and then i've got my shadows and so what's cool about this is that these scenes they're all style but not camera dependent which means that the style is saved to the scene but the camera location is unchecked so i did that intentionally and the reason why is because anytime you save a view in this case i don't really want my section so let me make sure my style here does not reflect a section cut i'm not doing sections for this there you go so basically this is the opposite of what i just did i have no scenes i have no perspectives no plan views none of that stuff set but i have my styles saved so the reason for doing this is that if i wanted to just kind of if i was doing going to send this to to photoshop or to procreate or something that i could pick a camera angle that i wanted to use as my say my perspective camera twoo perspective i'm happy with that camera angle i come over here and i go file export animation same thing um check my options one frame per second no scene transitions and whatever size i want 1080p is fine in this case i'm going to call this one perspective and this is going to be i'm going to render this in photoshop so i'm going to say render and hit export so it's going to export now it's going to pick up this default camera this default style and because the camera was not saved in these scenes it's going to export all of that particular view so all the styles that i need to work in that particular view are now saved and the cool thing about that is because i don't have that camera saved if i go back to my default style and i want to pick a different perspective i want to go for example inside the coffee shop maybe find a cool view where i'm looking inside as if i just stepped in and i'm going to place an order we'll call say that's good enough camera twoo perspective now in this case i didn't even save a scene i'm not even saving it to a scene i'm just going to go i don't have time i'm just going to do some loose sketches of course i could save this to a scene and store this camera angle to come back later the point is i'm just try to get something out of sketchup fa really quick so i'm going to come over here export animation again and i'm going to say in this case this is perspective interior spell it out if i want and then hit export and same thing it's going to kick me all of those views with all of those different style settings all at the same time so if i grab that all the way i grab these um five all together and open them up and i have everything i need to go into compositing and start layering these together and start doing a collage or start doing a hand sketch or start doing whatever it is that i want to do or annotate if i'm going to put them in a booklet and i want to you have a version that i want to up or one that i need something for selections if i'm going to sort of isolate or mask objects out so that's just a really fast way to do that so again um whether you are just exporting a bunch of scenes or exporting something stylistically um to composite or to render we've got both of those options this process has both of those options covered and in this case i'm just showing you in two different models but of course you can do this in the same model if you wanted to and save yourself some time so that's actually it for the batch export process i know i've covered this as a lesson in the past as part of my sketch up to photoshop workflow but it doesn't have to be necessarily too photoshop it doesn't have to be style dependent and that's why i wanted to show you it in two different ways you know so you can think about whether or not that um whether or not you want to lock that camera and have a bunch of scenes or whether you want to have a free floating camera and then have a bunch of styles and either way that b batch export process really simplifies um getting a bunch of content out of sketchup and wherever you want to take it from there so speaking of from here i'm going to leave you with that and i'm going to say say thanks as always for tuning in and watching with us today hope you learn something new if you haven't tried this process at least go experiment with it just so you're familiar and you're comfortable with it and uh who knows when you're going to need it so don't forget to give us that thumbs up if you liked it uh if you haven't already and uh i'll say thank you on that note and see you next time [music]
