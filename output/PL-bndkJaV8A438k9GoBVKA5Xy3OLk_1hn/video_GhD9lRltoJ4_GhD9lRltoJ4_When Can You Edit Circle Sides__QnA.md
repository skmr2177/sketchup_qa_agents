##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghd9lrltoj4 uploader: sketchup duration: 628 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:02:53.567373 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about when you can and cannot edit the segments of a circle and [music] sketchup so i'm going to go ahead and say that i assume at this point uh you know enough about sketchup or or you familiar with sketchup sketchup's uh circles and arcs are made of segments um we'll talk about that real briefly but there are certain times in your modeling where you can actually change increase or decrease either the number of segments or the radius of the circle or arc um after it's drawn so you can set it at first create it and you come back and make modifications to it there's certain geometry though when you go in and create it or add it uh it's going to prevent that from being able to be changed we're going to talk about what those what those blockers are right now all right so we're starting with an empty model here we got we got nothing so i'm going to do is i'm going to just tap c and draw in a default circle so you can see the default down here 24 sides i'm just going to click and pull this out to some arbitrary dimension and there we go got a circle all right i'm going to hit a and i'm do the same with an arc i'm going to click here then i'm going to click here and i'm just going to pull an arc out and there we go so now i have a circle and an arc default for a circle is 24 sides default for an arc is 12 sides that's what i've got drawn here now if i come in here and pick on the arc say over here under entity info i can actually see both the radius and the number of segments and i can come in here and i can edit them right so i can come here and say i actually want six sides when to hit enter it'll update that same thing for the radius i can come in here it's whatever 3 fo 7 3/4 so i'm going to say i want to be 3 foot even hit enter it'll shrink that perfect if i come over here when i pick a circle i do have to be careful because if i pick the face um it's just going to tell me the the square measurement of that face if i want to change the geometry of the actual circle itself i do have to pick that edge the outside edge there it comes up tells me it's 24 sides and it's 12 foot or 2 foot 6 i'm going to go in and say okay i want this to be 12 sides you can see enter drops it down and i want to be 3t even so i'll just triple click 3 foot enter and there we go so so you see pretty easy editing now there are certain points where things are going to happen here um where i have to change where i can't change that anymore um there's some changes i can make that will be okay so if i come down here and i go um i'm just going to draw a couple edges to close this arc in i can still select the arc at this point and change that so i can go back up to 12 enter and i can even change the radius so if i change it to 24 in it'll shrink down and the edges will pull along with it so there are certain times where i can still oops i meant to go three foot undo a couple times things got too crazy there um so i can go through and i can make changes i can just showed before whether this face is in here or not if i delete that click right here i can still come in and i can change that value um yeah so basic changing of that geometry from the start yeah i can edit that as much as i want now certain things are going to immediately prevent me from editing so for example here's a big one push pull if i push either of these up and come in here and select the edge i can change the radius so i can change the size but i can't change the number of segments same thing for the arc i come in here and change the radius but i can't change number of segments so that's one thing that happens that affects it now the cool thing is if i come in here and i get rid of this geometry right so i delete that we rid of all that delete that same thing over on the circle if i delete that and drag it back down so now it's just the shape on the ground again watch this if i pick this i'm back to editing both this the radius and the segments so i can change them again uh after that so it's not a per permanent breaking i can go in there i can modify a little bit you know i can i do a push pull bring it back down it still works again now let's show some other things so one one thing here is scale is a big one so if i have this circle selected and i come in and i click scale and i make this smaller watch watch my my ui over here when i let go ready let go it updates it so it's still 24 sides but it changed the radius because i actually changed the scale and it's going to watch that so it does update it and changing the scale does not prevent me from changing the number of segments all right now here's a fun one so let's take a line and i'm going to draw it all the way down here this and then over on the arc i'm going to draw a line from right here just come out here so what i've done effectively is broken both my circle and my edge with new edges or or my circle and my arc with new edges so if i look at these two so these are two separate things you see what they're listed as in the in the properties over here is as an arc so in this arc i'm going to tell to go uh 20 sides on one side and then the other side i'm going to take pick on it and say drop this one down to six and i can do that so this is still the geometry of the circle the radius of the circle but now i have two different number of of uh segs ments so over here same thing i'm going pick this one up to 10 enter and i'm going to grab this one and drop that down to three enter and i can do that now here's the fun part watch what happens when i delete this edge and this edge when i pick this it says oh yeah i recognize that that's a circle and look at my number of segments it tells me that my 20 plus my 6 is 26 they're not the same though it's kind of cool so so if i was to come in here and adjust this say i was to take this back to 24 it goes back it evenly distributes same thing with my arc when i pick the arc and it's 13 again 10 segments here and then another three here if i go put that back to 12 it's going to evenly distribute that put it back to 12 same thing um that is really cool that's f i actually did not know that that happened until i started making this video um because i'm a fan of pushing it i did this i'm going to show i'm going to show you exactly what i tested so if i draw something that and uh let's say i do something edit the size so let's grab this and make this a i don't know um 40in radius enter and then this one will make a 12 in radius okay that was extreme let's let's go a little let's go a little tamer than that go to 24 so now i have two different arcs here if i come in here and i break this they don't heal that stays as two separate arcs same thing over here if i come grab this one this is now 3 fo6 i drop this down to 3 foot even if i erase that and i have two separate arcs it doesn't heal back together if i drop this one down to 3 foot even though the same that original break is too much for it so now it's separate pieces it will still individually i can still come in and and change either one of these so i come into this side and say drop that down to six segments but it's not going to heal back up with the other piece uh and you know become one piece ever again i broke it that's that's that's an all the way broken piece so um e i'm ending with this ugly ugly mess here i'm going to have to make sure the thumbnails pulled from the clean circle and arc that i have before and not this mess but there you go that is a look at the things you can do to both circle and arc geometry when you can edit when you can't and when it will heal itself and when it it won't you know i really it when we make videos and the final thing that's on the screen is the big win instead of here's what to do to make an ugly thing um but that's that's reality sometimes stuff gets ugly that's why command z is so nice or control z undo is such a good one um but there you go i've we've had lots of questions come up on the forums about that uh people are asking all the time when you know why when i do this i edit it when i do this i can't and that was pretty much a list of the things that i could think of that would make something that uneditable uh an arc or a circle number of sides um yeah if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below did i miss something is there a a a specific you can do and then go back and still edit those uh if so leave that down in the comments and if you have another idea or a question about sketchup that you're not sure about leave that down in the comments as well we making these videos a lot we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
