##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: scale figures fast video id: yylzbtzmvm4 playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yylzbtzmvm4 uploader: sketchup duration: 703 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:16:01.501764 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today i want to talk about a quick way to create scale figures so scale figures are kind of heather over here each version of sketchup has their own scale figure and people to make other scale figures the whole idea behind them is that they show scale of the model that's the name scale figure but it's almost a rite of passage to put yourself into a scale figure if you're a sketchup user i used to be part of being a new employee at sketchup you had to go get your scale figure made and get it up on 3d warehouse uh if you don't already have it you should you should have you should have your own scale figure uh they're not difficult to make but they are kind can be a little bit of a time consuming process but with the newest version of sketchup uh for desktop i came across something i'm this makes it really quick and easy and i want to show you exactly what that is all right so what we're going to focus on is creating the outline the lines that make a scale figure filling these in coloring them in that's paint bucket i'm not even going to bother with that i just want to get a white outline of a photo real quick now just to take breakdown heather here you can see here she's uh got some some line segments here it's not not everything's not smooth perfect round lines uh that's fine this is where a lot of people draw them it's it's supposed to be a representation of a human it does the job it's perfect so i have a couple tips i want to throw out there i'm going to start by importing a reference image so i did take a picture of myself this morning and go ahead and import it when you take a picture of somebody for a scale figure you want to get the camera fairly low because you want the feet to be close to parallel you've all seen those pictures where you're looking at the person looks they're standing up on their tiptoes or they're jumping in the air but this was down about the camera was about a put maybe foot and a half off the ground so this was as close to parallels i could do on my own um i'm going to import it large bring it nice and big this and i'm going to make one change to my styles and that is my edge i don't want to use black lines i want to use something that's going to stand out so i'm actually going to change this to a yellow color so just something bright i'm wearing red blue so they get around some of these dark things my hair it's gonna that that black line would disappear be hard to see what i'm drawing all right now i'm going to come in here and i said generally speaking what we would do to do this is use a combination of drawing lines and then drawing arcs or possibly downloading the bezier tool to do this i'm going to do the whole thing and i'm going to do it pretty quickly with freedhand now what freehand is going to let me do is i'm going to pick a spot right here and i'm just going to trace around where my lips are something this i might be a little bit sloppy i'm trying to go kind of quick and i'm going to draw it so that it crosses over itself where it comes to a connection so right there it crosses over a little bit too much i'm going to delete that extra edge and i have a closed piece to grab that tool again and let's see i'm gonna start this one i'm going to come over here pull up onto my face come around here i'm doing all of this just with a regular mouse too there's no no tablet magic or anything that and i'm just going to come around this whoops down i'm gonna cross right over that this is this is the the tip is finding ways to draw where you can continue to cross over your own lines right here i'm gonna start this next one add an end point oops i didn't get into prehensible i went to line i have a shortcut for line i accidentally tapped on it all right so with this i'm going to come around this draw this up i didn't quite get my whole hair i don't i don't need that much hair anyhow that's that's excessive that is oh it's time for a haircut i'm gonna take this and i'm gonna cross it into this other piece see that that line started on an end point and ends crossing in then i just delete this piece off the edge this doing it this way is going to allow me to really create a scale figure in a couple minutes as opposed to maybe you know half an hour hour you can spend a lot of time on scaffold here now i'm i i do apologize i'm going a little bit probably faster and looser than i normally would i want to see if i can finish this whole thing in the time it takes to create one of these videos so we'll see how how close they get this is going to be an issue right because here i have i'd have to zoom way out to see my whole torso and get my shirt in one go so i'm going to break this down too i'm gonna go grab my my thing here i'm gonna start on a point here and then maybe i'll come in and trace just my collar this that's a logical break that i might want to put on again cross it in delete that last piece next time maybe oh man not really a good spot to break so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to start drawing my upper body this i'm going to pick a point there's a fold or something maybe i'll try this i don't know i'm making things up right now i'm just going to come straight across this and then this and then i'm going to cross that in that erase that i want to give myself is kind of a place to pick this up so i could come here grab this corner maybe trace this around this and then i can bring this line up this and get a couple of these wrinkles something that and then if i can oh look at that i hit right on the end point so i can just get rid of that line and that's closed up same thing we'll go grab this right here pull this down and i did mention this at the beginning of the video but i want to reiterate this is available in newer versions of sketchup so this functionality this this this nice clean drawing of lines isn't something you're going to find 2018 2019 uh i believe it is the 22 and up version of sketchup for desktop it has this improved uh freehand tool here we go all right look at that so what what are we in we're six minutes into this video and uh i've got upper half of my body drawn again this is not shouldn't be a difficult long drawn out process but this is pretty quick this is definitely going a lot quicker than it would have without the freehand tool now i'm just talking a little bit to kind of eat up the space but uh i think you are getting the idea of what i'm what i'm doing here so again here i'm going to try to just cross right in there and i can undo and redo some of these edges too so there are spots this that i'm getting so because i'm starting each of my line segments on a point and then pulling them around and dropping them back across the line i just have to delete one piece but there's some edges that don't look awesome this right here so with this guy i might just come in here and do something that erase that so there's definitely opportunities for cleanup i'm not saying this is a one and done situation but you can kind of see all right i'm just gonna i'll shoot for i'll finish the upper body here you will have have a full idea of how this works from there all right so let's get this other hand oh i did no i couldn't even see my hand undo let's try that again now the other thing i wanted to point out is this this is definitely not going to give the most perfectly detailed uh scale figure and honestly i'm gonna tell you right now i think that's good i think one of the problems that people are into with scale figures is they try to pack everything i might as well just go for it i'm just gonna do the whole thing they try to pack everything they can into their scale figure right there get the checkers on their shirts or the uh you know the seams and their jeans every fold every everything and i'm not saying you shouldn't go for that but again one of the things we talk a lot about on this channel is creating performant models and if you have you know 10 000 edges just on one scale figure might be a little much okay i would probably have to clean that up that is how my jeans folded but that that makes me look i got a growth issue there so all right so i'm just gonna wrap this these jeans up this try to go just cross over a little bit there those two pieces and then finally i'm just going to do my shoes as one one piece and then one more over here and again this might not be my final this might be just enough to get me started maybe i'll go back in and clean that up now but uh yeah so i can see that grab that i'm going to start i'm gonna start by doing this let's rotate it upwards there we go and then let's scale it grab a tape measure we go for my foot to my head that's about six foot two yes there we go i believe a little taller than heather that looks about right and then finally just grab all of that make a component and then one of the things i want to make sure i do is always face camera hit create and there we go i said i didn't didn't color it but i could always come in here and and do that but gets you an idea of how to get those lines in pretty in pretty fast fashion in fact i would say that is the quickest i've never created a scale figure in less than 10 minutes that so this should be taken as a step in a process lines are a big important part of it the rest of it using color adding details sure absolutely but man using that tool that that freehand tool gets you outlined so fast it's a great way to do it if you have a major scale figure before give it a shot give that a try and see what you come up with if you that video click down below and if you don't already please do and most importantly leave us a give us a you know we hearing what you have and we when you us with other people so help us out with that and have a great day foreign foreign
