##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: 3 ways to create build-up animations video id: pocjtfmxbrm playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pocjtfmxbrm uploader: sketchup duration: 642 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:06:14.521147 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here and today i'm going to with you three different ways to create phased or builtup animations using sketchup native tools so real quick explanation what do i mean by buildup i think i hope it's self-explanatory but sometimes it's not so sometimes you see a model that almost reveals itself so it's you start at the base and then you know the sort of things kind of come in or they build or they fade or they transition in and i want to look at a way to do that in fact i want to look at more than one way to do that using just native tools here in sketchup with the model that you see behind me so let's just go ahead and get to it all right this is the model i'm using it's a simple house and if i open up my tags and i turn on color by tag you can see that it's organized fairly fairly simply so this is kind of what i mean by buildup what i want to do is build up from the ground so if i turn the architecture the building off and if i turn the deck sorry not the deck that's just the order that it goes in it's not the order that it builds up in that's alphabetical order turn the furnishings off and then all of a sudden you can see we start with the ground plane and we're going to build our way up now i'm not going to use a color by tag that was just to kind of show you how it's organized so now what's what are some different ways uh to do that you've probably seen this trick before but i'm going to toggle my section cuts on and i'm going to double click this section here and then i'm going to double check my i think i need to open up styles for this because sections are actually managed in styles so if you say show section cuts just want to make sure that that is defaulted here so that you can um so they'll show so for some reason if they don't show just make sure that you turn them on and that you update your style to reflect those so you can see i've got two section cuts one way to do this is you could delete this one and you can just copy this one up you want to basically copy it up above doesn't m really matter where it is necessarily it just needs to be above the building and then i've got this lower one and i've got this upper one so when you have this start section here what we're going to do is we're going to turn those toggle we're going to turn the toggle of the sections off and i'm going to make sure my style doesn't actually show those and then this is where you want to check things if that was a little bit slow under model info obviously for doing an animation in this case i'm starting with the section so i want to um i'm going to let that do the reveal right so if 10 seconds is too long i can drop that number down to six or five or whatever i want it to be and then you basically create another tag so the other tag is going to show the end animation so for example if i toggle my section cut on this one would be the active cut and then i would update this and then if i go back to the beginning you can see now it's doing it in reverse it's going all the way down and if i toggle my section cuts on you can see this one here is the active it's already the active cut so that's an active cut cut that's an active cut i have two scenes one showing each cut and that is pretty pretty cool now because both the camera path animation and the section reveal are done natively here in sketchup all you have to do is just come over here when you're ready to export in this case i've exported this as an animation and i have this right here now this is pretty cool again you can loop it you can go backwards that's the first way the first one of three ways and i think that's the quickest to be honest with you uh because it's all you need is two scenes and you need two section cuts and one so if you don't have to do the you don't have to do the camera pan if you want to leave it there you just each scene has the same camera location and then you could do the reveal without the pan so now let's look at it a different way let's look at what would happen if i started with a blank just a blank scene basically you can see in my tags i've turned everything off and then i've created four scenes that basically just control visibility so one for the deck one for the furniture and one for the architecture so now i want it to build up but instead of cutting a section where it's revealing it using the section cut it's actually just bringing sort of popping the objects in now if i just did a straight export you'll notice that what i'm calling a static export you can very simply export four images one two don't know why those opened in two windows but whatever three and four so 1 2 3 3 four let me show you what that looks in a movie in a video because i think that's actually kind of cooler so this is basically what you call what i'm calling a build up or a fade up animation we already did our section up animation so let's press play on this you can see that what it's doing is um starting with the ground floor and then it's building up my furnishing elements and finally it's building up my architecture now those cross dissolves that you saw there i actually exported those as four images and then in a video editing program i just overlapped those images so that you could get that cross dissolve so that's one thing that's the one thing that sketchup doesn't do natively so what i did is i i'll export those as just images and then in the video program you can do that cross dissolve super simple technique you don't have to be a video pro to know how to do that of course you don't need that cross dissolve but i it because it shows that it's sort of almost it's revealing itself you know uh rather than just bam it's there if you didn't have that crossed disel so that's method number two now let's close those and let's look at method number three now i did that same thing i did that same um in this case animation where i rotated around but one thing i did is i went into my styles and i turned section cuts off and i updated it so watch what happens when you do that same animation now from the start to the finish that kind of slow rotation i thought oh that's kind of cool i really the dynamic of the camera movement but i really liked the sort of subtlety of the fading of the sort of each of the individual elements right so remember deck furnishing and buildings so what i did was basically come over here and then just start with uh wh did it out of order again start with just the deck come up here and go file export animation so i actually exported three animations now pro tip always double check um always double check in your options menu what the frame rate is so in this case i want 24 frames per second and if i know it's a 10-second animation it's going to means that this animation export is going to basically generate 200 and 40 frames not that you need to know that you can make it whatever you want it to be but just the point is is always double check that frame rate of course because that's going to control how smooth it is or it might control your speed depending on what your um if you go into info right it also has to do with what your transition time is between scenes so that said i would export this animation so this one camera path using only the deck and then i would do another camera pass of the deck and the furnishings and then i would do one more animation export of that same camera path basically from start to end with the buildings right so you end up doing three separate animations i know that sounds a lot of work but it only takes a couple minutes to do do each one so it doesn't really bother me too much to have to do that three times and then if we look at the finished product now so i'm going to do this one here basically this is a buildup using my scenes so i did that exact same buildup that i did on the static image but because i'm using scenes i can get a camera movement as well so watch there's the camera movement get that cross dissolve fade that i did in a video editor because i have three different ones and then you can see finally i get my architecture that fades on top and i faded it back to white on purpose because i thought if i was going to make this as a gif or a looping animation or something that then you want to do that sort of fade to white give you an example here i've got this same one but i've got that same animation and i've got it as a gift so you can just export mp4 um to gif and cool thing about having this little looping animation as a gif is that it's something that's really now easy to embed into a website so for example if i was sending out an email blog or if i was posting it to a forum or something that often times gifts are file smaller in file size they play automatically and they may be just more responsive as far as how it fits into your your web template than what you would find um with it with a movie file which sometimes the user has to press play so that's uh that's the one that i i kind of the most of course if you go back and just one more time turn my section cuts on update my style um of course the fastest way to do it is literally going back to that first method that i showed you which is gets that sort of camera movement and it gets that reveal but it's doing it with these section cuts it's almost a little cheat so you only have to export one animation rather than three the way that i just did um with this last one so that's it for my buildup three different ways again just to recap you can use sections you can use static images or you can use scenes and scene transitions to export an animation which in then which case you can layer each of those on top of each other you can cross dissolve them you can mask them clip them add other things titles you can get fancy you can get crazy or you can keep it super super simple but i this phased building approach i the how dynamic it is and i that it allows me to sort of control or reveal information um instead of just giving you the design all at once so i'm going to stop there i'm going to say if you haven't tried either of these methods pick one of them at least the one that you think works for your project or one you think's easiest or whatever and give it a shot um if you have any questions about how i um how i do cross dissolves what video editors anything that's sort of non- sketchup related of course post those in the chat below and i would love to keep that conversation going there and with that i'm going to say thanks as always for watching watching and i will see you next time [music]
