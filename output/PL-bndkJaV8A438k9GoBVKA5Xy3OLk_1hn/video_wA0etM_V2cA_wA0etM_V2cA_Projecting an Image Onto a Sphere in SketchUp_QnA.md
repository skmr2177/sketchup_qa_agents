##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about projecting images on the spheres so we're going to look at a couple of options actually to get a sphere we we'll make a quick sphere and uh i want to make it look a pool ball so something that just you know literally printed on a sphere nothing nothing else uh and we're look at a couple different options we have some native tool well it's all native tools but we have a way to actually color and paint stuff that we don't have to to use an image but then i want to take a look at taking an image and having it wrap around uh something a ball so let's uh let's make some pool balls right now all right first thing of course we're going to need is we are going to need a sphere so uh a while back i did a video on creating a sphere in six seconds uh i'm probably rusty now so let's let's uh let's give it a shot uh it's two commands it is a circle and it is me so i'm just going to go ahead and grab a circle going to draw two circles one on the ground here one on the in the air right here grab this bottom one say me grab this one and we have a sphere all right so i'm going to make a couple copies of this sphere real quick i'm going say move option and do uh 2x something that okay so i want a to take these spheres and i want to make them look pool balls uh you know the obvious one to go for is the eightball everybody you know whatever geeks out on the eightball but i want to do a number four ball why a number four ball because purple's my favorite color and four is the perfect shade of purple so uh i'm going to start by importing an image so i'm going to go file import and right off my desktop here i'm just going to grab this picture of a four and just drop it just double click to place it right there all right so this is what we're going for uh you've got a white circle in the middle the rest of it this nice purple color black four in there so before we actually talk about projecting this i do want to just see what i can do with the modeling tools so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say view and show me my hidden geometry right so if i look at this i can see that i i have stuff broken into segments here right um so what i could do is i could come in with the paint bucket tool grab that bring it over here i could grab this nice purple color and if i wanted to i could actually come in here and start coloring these segments in um i got that i don't got time for that so what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to come to a side view this i'm going to zoom out a little bit and i'm going to grab a select window and i'm just going to grab guess that much and that's going to select everything except these top two segments here and the bottom two segments here and then i can grab that same purple color and i can tap here oops i didn't go back into the uh command got you do have to actually tell it what command as good as we try to make software it doesn't read mins yet so i do have to say and tap the paint bucket tool to get that and all right so we're we're about halfway there uh if i go to view and turn off my h geometry all right i'm i'm pretty close to a four ball right now i'm going to need some text in here obviously the four there so what i'm going to do is i'm going to use 3d text to do this i'm going to go to tools and i'm going to grab my 3d text i'm going to type a you already figured out a four i could go through i i could spend some time finding the perfect text for this but in my afternoon of perusing four balls on the internet i found that fonts change so there may be official i don't know pool guy world i don't know i don't know if the official controlling body is for pool ball creation but there may be an official font i personally i'm good with whatever this is times that's fine let's go ahead and do that i'm going to place it i know this isn't going to be the right size i'm just going to drop it on the ground here and then i'm going to come in here with scale and i'm going to start by making it taller and then uh let's also make it bigger let's just uniformly that's fine uh it's probably a little too tall okay so something that might be i don't there may also be you know a rule for how big the four is compared to the rest of the ball but uh i don't know i'm going to eyeball it nailed it all right so that looks pretty good that's that's about where i want it to be awesome uh so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to select this surface i'm going to right click i'm going to say intersect face with model that means any place that this surface intersects any geometry in the rest of the model it's going to break so when i do that i'm just going to take this and i'm going to drop it straight down so it pokes out the other side and then i'm going to go back to color grab my black there we go all right so we got a pretty good four ball there the other side of course is going to be well pretty much the same thing except obviously i'm not a math guy but i don't think that four is right so we're going to want to flip that of course so what i could do i this a couple different ways i guess there's actually all right i'm thinking of a lot of different ways i'm going to use select to pick it go to move and then just use the the this to flip it around that flip it to 180 degrees awesome and then same thing i can can select this intersect face with model erase this fill that with black all right so there we go so i i could i can make a four ball with just modeling tools but let's take a look now how we might go about putting this image onto this ball instead all right so i'm going to bring this over here i'm going to lay it right underneath doesn't that doesn't have to be perfect well actually you know if you have the option perfect is always nice you know lining things up perfectly when possible is kind of cool and with inferencing i'm just going to grab the edges the middle points of both sides of the image and line it up with the center point of this ball now i'm going to hit scale and i'm going to modifier key to scale around the middle and just drop this down so it's almost that images almost smaller proba should go a little bit bigger just slightly larger than the ball itself now this currently isn't a sampl image or or samp material so i can't apply this so if i come into my paint bucket tool i can't say pick this see i get that little no sign it tells me uhuh that's the that's the title of that little circle with a line through it it's called a uh-uh so i get a uh-uh when i come in here to do that what i have to do a couple things i'm going to want to do here so first i'm going to select right click and i'm going to explode an image an image is just a texture that is on a surface that is locked into a special group once i explode it this just becomes a face that has a material on it the other thing i'm going to want to do is right click on just the image now you saw there before everything was highlighted i'm going to deselect pick just the image right click texture and i want to make sure projected is turned on projected says when i apply this to something it's going to a projector push this image all the way across a material or a surface so with that i'm going to say paint bucket select see my my uh's gone i can just pick this material apply it right here and look at that i got a good looking four ball right there if i flip around the other side i'm going to see a thing that i'm not necessarily going to uh i can just actually i can delete this i don't need this material anymore my four's backwards over here see that so that's not ideal what do i do about that well let's let me let me think of some solutions uh one thing i could do is i could modify the geometry let's do that let's let's go ahead and go to view turn on our hidden geometry i'll look at it right from the side and i'm going to select the bottom half then i'm going to right click and i'm going to say erase get rid of that i'm going to temporarily make this a group because i'm going to use rotate to flip this copy i'm going to hit option to make a copy and there we go now i have for facing the right way four is facing the right way well if i wanted to i could i guess i could do this too i don't actually again i don't know what direction if the two fours are supposed to be the same way mine's upside down but they're both the same um at that point probably take those two make them into their own group i should probably triple click make this into a grouper component also but uh yeah so there we go i'm going to turn my hidden geometry back off i'm curious it's not quite centered on there but uh looks my circle my guess of of two rings of the circle is about the right size all right so with that and again it doesn't matter that that's off center because as soon as i go to uh my view and turn off my in geometry you know that's what's important but there we go so we have a couple options there for how we might want to create that uh four ball i i got a white ball here just because you know i wanted i wanted to paint a q ball too so knock that one out quick but there we go yeah so there's a couple different ways to go about creating uh a surface that wraps all the way around a sphere now there is some important stuff here uh when does wrap it's not actually wrapping so i said wrap but really it's projecting i said it's projecting right onto it so if you have an image that doesn't fully cover the circle when you project you might get weird edges uh you know if you have a square where the image go out the side it's going to distort a little bit uh something this is perfect because by the time it gets out the outside edges is just materials we have a little bit of reflectivity and stuff going on up here but it's really just that material that goes around the outside um but it's a great way to use projected and and on a on a surface a sphere you know it shows just how easy that is to do i hope you that hopefully you liked that video if so click down below and let us know that uh if you're not already subscribed please do too we create several videos each and every week and to be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below have you done something this before have you used a different process a different method is there something that you think would make a good video that we should know about we making these videos a lot we' them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank [music] you
