##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: concept design alternatives in one model video id: ctww3b1dxtm playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctww3b1dxtm uploader: sketchup duration: 638 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:15:51.817776 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here today i want to with you some of my tips for creating concept design alternatives basically seeing two different designs in one model until you're ready to make a decision on what to move forward with so i hope it's pretty self-explanatory sometimes in the design process we either intentionally want to show two or three different concepts in order to get the client or the stakeholders feedback we do that on purpose sometimes we'll we know which option we want to move forward with as a designer but not always you know can we just pick that and go we kind of make sure that the client's feedback is taken into consideration so when you've got a model and you've got some pieces in it already i want to look at some ways to maybe streamline or optimize that process to make it a little bit easier so you're not saving a duplicate model and then saying oh here's model one here's model two and then in which case if you change a door change a wall now all of a sudden the models are out of sync so i want to do those concept alternatives inside of one model and let's just go ahead and do it right now so i've got my model you've seen this before i'm going to plug it from our scan sketchup campus course i'm going to reference that at the end i'm just going to kind of get started here so what works really well about this model in particular this design is that it's an interior design project so when i say concept alternatives i guess i'll be a little bit more specific and say in this case furnishing alternatives now let me go and put myself into the kitchen here just kind of explain the space if you haven't seen us model before it's a co-working space and there's a kitchen and try not to get stuck in a wall if i look over here there's uh this is sort of what i'm calling the default concept so if you come in you've got a kitchen and you've got well maybe actually it's better to see it in plan view there you go reception area kitchen workstations lounge and sort of built-in bin cut seating so just for fun we're going to go ahead and flip this part of the design this kind of section over here we're going to flip that around so that we can see what that might look if it was if we rearranged it and said well maybe that's not exactly where things need to go so the first thing i need to do is i've actually kind of already done it but basically is you want to kind of group the different things now you could make it a component but if you want to make changes when i when i do my alternative design if you make a change move a table of course it's going to change it in both designs so in this case what i've done is i've got everything's a component chairs component table is a component all of it everything's a component but then when i put them in a container that container is a group so that was sort of done intentionally so i've got kind of my lounge or a area and seating area group and i've got this workstation kind of co-working space so let me switch over to perspective maybe that's a little bit easier to see it now in this case one to do is i'm actually going to make a group out of both of those if i hold shift here i can get both of those and then i'm going to copy it i'm using my keyboard shortcut and paste it in place so now you can't see it because they're sitting on top of each other but i actually have two of the same seating arrangement now for simplicity's sake i'm going to go ahead and use or just kind of speed up i'm going to use the scale by negative one tool of course you could use the new flip in 2023 if you prefer to use that method and it's a little bit confusing here because i have two sets of furniture sitting on top of each other i have my original which i'm calling alternative or concept one and then i have my flipped or my inverted version which i'm going to call concept 2. so the first step in this process is right now everything's showing we need separate tags so that we can toggle things on and off now i already have everything tagged i have my furnishings i have my details my custom woodwork all that stuff's already tagged i'm going to leave those alone so this is basically a container tag for each of the design alternatives one two tags first one i'm going to call alt one does not matter necessarily what you want to call it at home and alt two so alt one again i said is sort of the default option so this sort of outside container group containing all of this arrangement this furniture i'm just going to put that on one and then if i turn that off you can see that disappears and then this kind of flipped version where i put the co-working tables over closer to the reception desk i'm going to call that alt 2. now that's fine and good so there they go i can switch back and forth between them it's a little bit tricky when you do it just using the tags here because it's not difficult to say what does this look and then you go alt one on alt two off but to me especially if i'm doing a live presentation i don't even really want to show the two alternatives overlapping at the same time i want to show one and then the other especially if they're different in this case they're just mirrored or flipped but if they're very different i would want something a little bit more seamless than just tagging turning the tags on and off so what i want to do here is i want to come in and it doesn't really matter i'm going to start on this perspective just because i want to add one to the end of my little dean sequence here and i'm going to call this one alt one and i'm going to make sure that alt 2 is turned off and that scene is updated and i'm going to add that same scene in this case i'm going to call it alt 2. and then i'm going to flip those alt 1 and all two okay so now that's great so i can flip between these two scenes and i can see what that design looks from this particular camera angle but i've got a couple different camera angles i want to look at i've got this view from the lounge area which is originally this was all this was originally when it was designed as a lounge and then i've got this view from the kitchen so i want to see what both of those look but if i hit the alt one it takes me back to the lounge so this is a really kind of simple trick or fix that i to recommend is that you can just disable the camera location so in this case it's not about where i'm viewing the alternative one versus alternative two it's actually more about just saving the tag states so i don't have to do that to tag or three tag turn off and on little juggle that i had to do alt 1 and alt two both have camera location turned off so if i wanted to i could pick any perspective in this case this perspective kitchen is not my final view you can see it's got everything turned on more importantly as i would click on the perspective kitchen to set the camera angle and then alt one to turn the tag state on same thing if i wanted to compare that same view to alt 2 and export that i could go back and forth and either show that on a screen or export those very easily same thing works from that opposite angle on that scene that i've already saved if i just go alt one this is kind of the default option what it looked before and then this is the alternative to it's the other alternative the the inverted or the flipped alternative so what's cool about that is because we're not locked to camera angle if i wanted to come over here if i was doing a live presentation and i said okay well when you come in if the client says well what does it look i really it i'm having a hard time deciding which one i better they both work really well actually you could say well what does it look from from the door when you come in and then all you have to do is click alt one alt two this is what alt one looks you can then look around the room i that you can go all two look around the room and say yeah that works um you know of course we may want to treat this bookshelf a little bit differently the way that we had it sort of embedded into a nook on the other alternative that kind of tells you that maybe you know you'd also have to treat the wall around the bookshelf as well to kind of get that integrated as well so again if i just kind of wanted to been around the only thing to keep in mind here is that if you are showing something in plan view remember that scenes remember sections are saved to styles not scenes so in this case the alt 1 and alt 2 doesn't work in plan view because i would need the section cut style saved so if you were working with sections you just have to keep that in mind you may want to just sort of either tell the story through section cuts or tell the story through perspectives because the way that they work is going to be slightly different just between the two of them so that's actually it i mean you can do as many concepts as you want and you just the same process so make sure that you have a group that sort of represents your alternative that that's tagged to its own name so it's clear and then that's assigned or toggled off or on depending on whether you want to show it and that's assigned a scene and then d uh basically unchecking that camera location that's totally an option for you as well because in that case it does give you that sort of freedom and flexibility to move around the space and you can just toggle those alternatives off and on without having to go again back into the tags menu and turn everything on and then turn things off one on uh one by one so as always i hope you found something useful in this video i mean even if it's just that camera location thing i haven't used that in a while that's a good reminder that you can use that to your advantage and sort of use it a little bit differently than how you maybe normally use scenes to sort of lock and fix that camera location so let us know what you think in the comments either way so i use that information that you give me take that feedback incorporate it into the next series of videos we make so either way let us know what you think and while you're there commenting don't forget to and you know we with subscriptions you get those notifications especially because we do more than just uh here at sketchup we do more than just the youtube videos we do live streams on fridays and we do sketchup campus and speaking of which this model here behind me i did say i was going to plug it when i'm not doing these videos on youtube and doing them live streaming i am building the campus content so that's learn.sketchup.com so this model that i used here in this little demo you can see it rendered here behind me on the splash page that's basically a full length course starting from scratch all the way to building out this model including this tip that i shared just now about creating concept design alternatives so so i'm going to leave you there and i want to say as always and see you next time [music]
