##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today i wanted to get into level of detail and how you can make sure you're putting the proper amount of detail in your sketchup models based on what you're going to use your model for all right so elephant in the room i do realize that the term level of detail is a bim thing it means the amount of information um you may work at a firm where you have set levels of detail where level one is different from a level three lod1 lod3 that kind of thing i'm not talking about that stuff um this is strictly what i'm speaking about is strictly about the amount of detail you're putting into something you're modeling and making sure that it is the right amount of detail for how you're going to actually use that model so that's what i want to talk about level of detail just seemed to be the right way to to phrase that even though i knew that term could be considered by some people to have a different meaning but that's what we're talking about we're talking about having the the right amount of detail in my right amount of geometry in a model based on what you're gonna use it for we're gonna take a look at that right now okay uh right here i have three faucets that i downloaded from 3d warehouse it would have been awesome to have the exact same faucet in three different levels of detail but uh these were what i was able to track down and find so um i'm gonna call these three different amounts of detail maybe amount of detail then that doesn't get confused with lod amount of detail detail-ness detailingness detailed yeah we should stick with the amount of detail so over here on the left this is a simple 2d faucet right you can tell it's 2d because it's flat um so this right here this is something you may throw into your model if you don't need three-dimensional views i mean a lot of people end up exporting 2d floor plans through layout from sketchup and that's it so they never go in and do any renderings or isometric views or anything that if that's the case something this slapped onto your sink is going to do just a fine job of showing that this is a faucet keeping in mind that when you actually see it it might be about that big right so see that little little set of lines right there that's representing a faucet and that's all you need at this point is that little teeny tiny bit of faucet showing up if that's the case 2d imagery this even i mean this this could be dropped in in the layout you could put in your countertops put a sink on there and then leave things this details this the the faucet or the sprayer or whatever other piece you have you might just leave that off and just drop it in this 2d layout that works fine too the advantage of using this is let's go ahead and double click in here let's grab everything here and i can see this is 80 entities that includes every edge every face um you see around here each of these edges of this this half circle or this arc right here 80 entities super lightweight i mean that's that's nothing i mean that's not gonna that's not gonna affect my model in any way shape or form right so a lightweight model this is going to lead to a more performant model i'm not going to have issues where maybe i'm building uh you know a condo block and they have 30 units and then each kitchen has this in here oh no problems no problems whatsoever right downside of course is as i rotate around this look at in 3d that's not impressive right if i want to do a rendering or something that i'm out of luck with this guy this is not going to lend itself to anything other than an overhead view so i'm not saying you should use this but this is the lowest level of detail you can create in sketchup this is just a 2d representation of 3d models so it's an option it's the lowest level a step up from that is what we have right here so this is a higher level of detail it's a 3d model it's not beautiful i mean it's not it's not i'm not going to go in and do a render of this by itself you can actually see as i'm moving around you can see the shadows jumping off the surfaces if i go up to view and i hit show hidden geometry you can see you can see right here this is not uh you know this is not made for close-up rendering anything that but what this does do is this does tell me there's a faucet here this looks great from above i can render this from the side i could i could move around the kitchen i'm going to see this and honestly if i come in here and select all this i've got a couple containers here there we go there's all my geometry 338 so about four times what i had over here but i said you can tell there's a fossil you can tell what kind of faucet this is uh if you have an eye for faucets maybe you even have an idea of whose faucet this is there's not a maker's on here but uh this is the level of detail that i would say would work for uh you know 3d views um the nice thing about this is if i had this in say i was doing an a section cut through my kitchen seeing that from the side is going to tell me a faucet it's a faucet just the same as if i saw it overhead so this is the nice medium this is the middle ground i would say this is the amount of detail that's you know the thing about faucets that i say it's about toilets too is if they show up in imagery you know i'm going to be zoomed back they're going to be about this big right if i want to see that a decent amount of the kitchen i'm not going to be in here this this faucet should probably in a normal architectural or design drawing would not fill up much of the screen so even if i was looking at a cabinet view you know where i'm looking here's all my cabinets and here's the faucet that's probably about as big as it's going to get on the page so i don't need 10 000 polygons in this faucet to make it do its job as a faucet and this is really what i'm talking about when i'm talking about a detail is how much detail how many polygons you want to put into this model so that it does its job so for general architectural construction drawings this level of detail works just fine now i do have a model it's a step up from there if i look at this in hidden geometry you can see i got lots of geometry right look at look at this little little button in here to cover up the screw hole um yeah you can see this little little right here to make uh the little faucet head that i can screw up or unscrew with the wrench it's got the little flat box in there and the little flat marks around it over look at that see all that geometry tons of geometry right a lot a lot of geometry here this is let's find out how much there is this is a couple uh levels deep but i think if i get down here far enough there we go okay so this has whoa wait hold on i'm gonna move a 33 000 entities so this is 10 times the geometry that was in our our previous this was 300 this is 33 000. so that's not 10 times that's that's uh sorry try to do math spontaneously right there um so you can see it is a whole lot more geometry but and i i did take the textures off of all these i printed or i i i use paint bucket to make everything just the plain white because i wanted to look at them side by side but you can see as i move around here over here where we had these softened angles kind of jumping as i move around see that that harsh geometry there's a weird line right there this i don't get that nice smooth shadows because i have so many polygons this right here would be overkill for this view right looking down from above again this big take your pick here right any of these would work just fine to show that there's a faucet on a eighth inch equals a foot floor plan looking at an elevation view yep that shows that there's a faucet i could probably even make out who's whose uh faucet this is based on the profile where the lines are that kind of thing i could figure that out this is a good detailed view in in an isometric view it's going to look great rendered out there looks awesome the downside is again if i'm i'm doing that condo that has i don't know 30 of these throughout the whole building that's a whole lot of geometry we're talking about millions of polygons just for faucets so it's a little too much now depending what i'm doing if i'm doing a beautiful render of a kitchen and i want this high poly thing because i'm going to put some chrome on here and it's going to shine and the sun's going to come in through the window and reflect off of it okay you know i get it i get having the smooth thing there if if you're a product manufacturer and this is your product then you might have a render that consists of this and absolutely you should have thousands of polygons in here that is that is exactly what this would be for for a regular construction drawing probably overkill probably more geometry than i need but if you're doing that high level render or that product product imagery then it makes a lot of sense so just to back up 2d lightest thing you can have most performant thing you're going to have only going to look good in one view top down view or i mean you could have this in a profile view too so but that's the only way it's going to look good over here on the other end super high res super polygon dense not going to be ideal if there's a bunch of these in the model not where you want to spend that you know that that that file weight is not on a faucet i said same thing for toilets i i toilets do this too also where it's super easy to get those curves and everything blown up so you have a million faces just in a toilet this is too much this is gonna eventually if there's multiples in your models it can cause your model to lag this guy in the middle couple hundred this is pretty performant it does the job you know from here if i zoom back to right here they're obviously different kinds of faucets but i can't tell that i'm missing a whole lot from this versus this so be considered especially using 3d warehouse look at your model download into a separate file open it up check it out see if it's the right amount of detail for the job that you are currently trying to do the crux of this thing right is that when you look at your model and you you see the geometry in there are you putting the geometry where you need it if you're drawing a floor plan you know your geometry should be going into stuff the house the floor the what are the things you need to see in order to build that house from that floor plan you're doing a render then you're going to put stuff into those curves those those fancy uh entourage pieces put the right amount of geometry in to what you need if you're just doing a mock-up i'm going to quick see how this you know how i might finish my basement something that you don't need a 33 000 face faucet to do a mock-up for a bathroom remodel just not necessary it's going to slow your model down we get models all the time on forum forums.sketchup.com if you're not right there you should check it out but people go oh my model is too big it won't open it's so slow it's so long and you open it up and they have you know toilets with two million faces a car in the garage with you know the cup holders detailed inside of it awesome models but not the right amount of detail for what they're trying to use it for so that's the biggest thing put the right amount of detail in for what you're gonna use it for and you'll be pretty happy let me know if you've ever run into this before love to hear about it down in the comments or if this is new to you and something you're trying love to hear that too if you have another idea of what you think would make a good video on our channel let us know that as well have a great day bye [music]
