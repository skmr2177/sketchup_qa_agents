##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- everybody here and today i want to show you how to build kind of a complex looking model you see behind me here using just a single component so first of all why would you want to do that and the answer is you might not want to um using a single component has some advantages and some disadvantages more than anything i think this is kind of a really quick way to play around with ideas so to build something conceptual but also for me to sort of practice my skills with using inferencing snapping the move copy so i think it helps if i show you instead of tell you so let's just get in and let's sort of build some more elements to this building that i started and uh you'll see what i'm talking about so let's do it so this is my model i just wanted to kind of show you really quick um i wanted to kind of prove to you this was all done using just just a single cube component so there's my component if i open up my components window you can see i'm in model and that was an old one so if i go model info purge unused there you go so there it is i've got just my person or my people here and i've got just this cube which you see it's already sitting here so i'm going to delete that anyway that's it just one component let's go take it a step further and if i actually go into that component and i modify it i'm just going to use the nonlinear scale by vertical and you can see you get something a little cool but not exactly what i was intending so when i say you may not want to do this method you're probably thinking exactly why would you want to do that well you wouldn't want to modify the inside of a component um because what you're going to do it's going to modify it to everything instead what we do is we modify the outside of the component so let me do a little example off to the side here i'm going to pull this cube over this is again that same cube and i'm going to practice i said we're going to use you can use uh the icons if you're an icon user i am a keyboard shortcut user so m for move and i'm going to hit option or control to make that copy so that's that modifier so this is what you're going to see is i'm doing the same thing over and over again i'm just grabbing this cube i'm making a copy of it and then i get to decide what i want to do i can scale it from the side or i can squish it and make it thinner or i can pull it and make it bigger make it taller or i can grab it from the corner and do a uniform scale and then again hitting that same option alt i'm going to modify that to create a uh uniform scale but from the center point instead of from the edge so that's what that modifier does so this is really cool um in this case then what i could do is just use this scale tool and then just if i need to i can use i can turn on my x-ray mode so i can grab a grip one of these grips that i can't see and i just snap it to that geometry that's already there now if i wanted to if i knew exactly how tall i wanted to and i didn't know what the dimensions were but i knew sort of i knew how big this cube was i could say i want this to be five times taller so that's how big that is or i could go um seven times taller um so if you know a proportion that you're working with you can always just enter the number in that way in this case what i want to do is also grab i want to grab this cube here i'm going to make a copy and then i'm just for i'm just playing around so i'm just going to divide this by s something six no maybe too much divide it by four and so this is kind of cool because even you can do sort of these complex arrays so even with this cube group now i've got something where i've got sort of different versions if i wanted something to be twice as big at something i could just go times two and again why would would you want to do this i'm not sure but if you're doing something sort of somewhat conceptual um or you're just building something um spaceship parts or something this this could just be a really quick way to create a little bit of variety again using just the the same component and i'm just copying stretching scaling rotating and having a little bit of fun i'm actually just kind of really thinking more about how something looks than again how big or how the exact dimensions that it should be so let's go back to this house here or this building and use something that's maybe a little bit more of a concrete literally example because i need the uh finish it out with doing the sidewalk so i'm going to grab my cube same cube just going to do the same technique that i just showed you in that little demo i'm going to turn my x-ray mode on so i can find a corner that's easy for me to snap to and then if i need to i can turn that x-ray mode on again i'm just using that with a keyboard shortcut and i want to toggle that uh i want to grab that grip and snap it in place so i'm using the building already the geometry that's already there as my reference i'm going to copy this over i don't know how many i want because again i'm not working to any sort of real dimensions just say times 10 to see how far that gets me i to work in even numbers and then there you go so i can select depending on if everything is grouped already and protected then what i could do is a really quick way to select all these is you could come over here and say select all instances so you can see every instance of this component if i'm using the same module for my score for my pavers i can just say select one and it'll select all of them i'm going to deselect that one of course that's my original and then i'm going to make a group out of this um and then from there i'm going to just stretch it into place so again i don't know how big that is i don't know how big it needs to be it just looks okay if i wanted to change that number of modules of course i can just i can change that by scaling it but i'm okay with the way this looks so i'm again i'm going to copy that we're going to kind of do that times two excuse me let's try that again i'm going to do sort of multiple modules so this last module here i might say well this is where the tree grates are going to go and sometimes you'll see a different size p so in this case all i need to do is instead of redoing that array i'm just using scale by the scale by the sort of nonlinear grip scaling along the red axis and then i just say 0. five which is half of my other one and i know that instead of 10 i have 20 in here so i can group those together as well and if i wanted to make that a little bit longer i just grab another one of those modules so that's pretty cool i just finished my sidewalk out again if i did want for some reason to differentiate the sidewalk between uh from what i see here there's two ways to do that if i just want to differentiate the color i could come over here and actually paint the outside of my sidewalk i going make sure i'm showing my textures and come over here and i could paint my sidewalk module there so again still one component if i ch if i edit it the whole model everything you know everything edits um but you can paint the outside of a component if you don't have any color already applied to it so some people say you really should paint the inside of the component of course if i go in and paint the inside of the component here if i do this what it's going to do is it's going to it's going to um it'll paint everything that same color and of course maybe i don't want everything to be that color maybe i want certain things to be certain colors even though i'm using one component i can still do that just by painting um the outside of stuff if i wanted to paint this sign here for example i could just come over here and paint or i could paint the whole thing or i could come into the group and paint that sign let me make that a color that you can see there we go go so again single component um single component made every single piece of this model and i've differentiated it just literally by using only one tool which is the scale tool that's it i just all i did was just scale it and um i'm also just snapping it to the geometry that's already there or i'm using the measurements box to say how far i want it to go if i wanted to do that as 5 or 75 or something that i can just create more variations of this same module using just scaling um by a scale factor and that's pretty cool obviously this is geometric so it works that i'm building a model that sort of um makes sense by just using a cube and rectangles and things that you can of course go organic if you wanted to bring in two components and you have an arch i mean think about what i could do with just two components an arch and a cube you could do quite a bit so i'm i'm stripping this down to its bare minimum which is just one cube uh but you can do you can of course push this sort of idea or this technique as far as you want to go and of course you don't have to stop there you can also make components of groups so in this case i can make a component and call this doors and windows and then now i have two components in the model i have one cube and i have in this case and let me make sure that i'm actually snapping this to the right point point do there time 2 and you can see now if i opened up my components window there should be three in this model there is the people as before there is my cube when we started and now i have a new module which is a new component which is this sort of grouping that's created that i used to create the doors and the windows so again now i'm starting with just one component but of course i'm not going to limit myself to that it makes sense that i would make if i knew something was going to repeat in this this case i wanted to move this window or if i wanted to scale this i could do this um having this be a component group because i know that it repeats is definitely sort of a smart modeling technique so i'm going to stop there because you get the idea uh the whole point is that it's a simple way to model it's super fast and it's also super flexible cu if you find yourself modeling and then you need to do something a little bit different you can always make a component unique uh and then that component is no longer going to uh if you have to go in and actually edit the inside of the component rather than the outside then it's not going to blow up your model uh you saw when i first stretched it when i first was playing around with that original cube so the idea of exploding components making them unique painting the outside of them and of course adding more than just the single cube you know it's a pretty robust process again not something you're going to build a house and then send it to construction documents but something where if you're building a stage set or you're building something for game art or you're just doing some visualization and you're just having some fun and uh exact dimensions do not matter this technique give it a shot so speaking of give it a shot give a below let me know what you think uh let's keep this conversation going on am i crazy is this stupid um i'd love to hear from you and your experience if you haven't tried it give it a shot let me know what you think and as always i'm going to leave you with a reminder give ourselves that if you if you the video if not don't um if you're not subscribed that way you get the latest content every single week that comes out and of course lastly thank
