## Q: What is the Follow Me tool used for in this tutorial?
A: The Follow Me tool is used to extrude a curved profile along a circular path to create crown molding. While the tool is used efficiently, it is not explained in detail. According to SketchUp Help, the Follow Me tool works by extruding a face along a preselected path.

## Q: How are snaps created?
A: Snaps can be created by editing groups and components. To make a snap, simply right-click on a group or component and select "Make Edit Snap". This will open up creation mode, allowing you to create new snaps by hovering over a point and pressing the command key (on Mac) or ALT key (on PC).

## Q: What is the difference between front and back faces of a snap?
A: Each snap has a front face and a back face. When creating a new snap, it's essential to set which face is pointing outwards. If you try to align two snaps together, they will orient to their respective fronts or backs. This means that if one snap has its front face outwards, the other snap should have its front face outwards as well.

## Q: Can snaps be embedded deeply within nested groups or components?
A: Currently, snaps do not work well when deeply embedded within nested groups or components. It's recommended to keep snaps at a high level, on one level deep, to ensure optimal functionality.

## Q: How can snaps be manipulated further?
A: Snaps can be manipulated by selecting them and right-clicking to access different modes, such as creation mode, eraser mode, and rotation mode. The rotation mode allows you to change the default arm about which the snap will rotate.

## Q: Are snaps available in all versions of SketchUp?
A: No, snaps are currently only available in the desktop version of SketchUp. However, they may be included in future releases for other versions, including web and iPad versions.

## Q: How can users provide feedback on snaps?
A: Users can leave feedback on snaps by commenting below, or participating in the SketchUp forums. The development team values user input and wants to make sure that snaps are improved and become an even more valuable feature.
