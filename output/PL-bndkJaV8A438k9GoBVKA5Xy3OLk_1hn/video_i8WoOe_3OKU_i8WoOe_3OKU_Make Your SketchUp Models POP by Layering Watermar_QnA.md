##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

title: make your sketchup models pop by layering watermarks video id: i8wooe_3oku playlist index: 5 playlist url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rn7kf4vq4m&list=pl-bndkjav8a438k9gobvka5xy3olk_1hn video url: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8wooe_3oku uploader: sketchup duration: 619 seconds downloaded: 2025-07-23t11:10:44.099655 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about layering watermarks so i said a thing just now and then i jumped away what is layering watermarks um generally speaking watermarks are text or an image that you layer on top of your work it might be text it says internal use only or uh you know not not to be shared or it might just be general data information or some data that you need to have on your work that goes out in sketchup watermarks are slides they can lay in front of or behind your current work so it can be a great way to get a background in but it's also a good way to get uh imagery or something that in front of the screen as well and we're going to take a look at how to do that right now so i'm going to work with this little cabin here um it's not a cabin it's it's a big look at this it's got to be 12t tall it's not a cabin anymore it's it's become a a big house house but uh it's a nice it's a nice structure it's fairly simple i got it on some snow here as i'm recording this it's just a beginning of december and i want to make this look a snowy mountain cabin uh so i could do this of course with sketchup i could model i could geolocate this and then throw you know a bunch of mountains in the background and throw some pine trees up in here and you know i could model some snowflakes and put them between the camera and i could do all that stuff but uh it would take time it would take energy and it would make my model heavy uh with my water marks i can actually get the same effect and uh do it much quicker easier and keep my model nice and light and snappy so uh yeah i have this scene right here so it's just a simple got a little little model with some uh shadows turned on and this is what i got this is what're going to work with so i'm going to come in here to styles in styles i'm going to click on edit and i'm going to come over to to the fourth tab which is the watermark tab and that's going to give me a list of my watermarks now i don't have anything watermarks in here right now so we're just going to go ahead and put some in i'm going to start with just a background so i'm going to hit plus i'm going to go i got these on my desktop um i have this snowy background jpeg i'm going to go ahead and open that and it's going to come up on the screen and it's going to ask me name it because i'm going to have a series of water marks i am going to name this so i'm going to call this my background and i'm going to say this is not an overlay an overlay means in front of the model so you actually see this in uh the styles panel right here i have model right now it's an overlay so that's in front of if i say background now it immediately drops below because it's behind my model so i'm going to keep it as a background i'm hit next i have the ability to say how transparent do i want this to be well i have no reason to maintain transparency to the background sketchup so i'm just going to go say give me all image make it solid beautiful next uh what do we want to do you want to stretch it out do we want to tile it do we want to position it i nine times out of 10 i position it position gives me the most control where i want it to go it also lets me scale the whole thing so if i scoot this down here we can actually see i can scale how big this waterm is going to be and i'm going to go big i'm going to drag it all the way as big as it can get and then i'm going to choose where i want to position it if i position it up higher it's going to snap the top it's gives me a whole lot of stars if snap it to the bottom then it moves my mountains up and i stars are nice but i'm trying to get an effect here of this background so i'm going to snap it to the bottom that's going to give me more mountain in the in the screen and then that's good i'm going to hit finish minimize this so we can kind of see what there we go so now i could i can move my uh my house around a little bit so it lays in there in the way that i want you know where what do what do i want to see as far as how close is it that kind of thing yeah that looks looks good got the background back there looks nice all right now let's get some stuff on top so let's let's put some things over top this is nice and clear but i want to make a snowy night so i could keep it this and just throw some snowflakes in front but let's let's get some haze in here so haze could be done with fog the problem with fog is fog will really mess with water marks so as i soon as i throw fog on i'll get this uniform kind of blanking out of my background so i don't want to use fog to create haze instead i'm going to use another watermark come back into styles i'm going to hit plus again and i have a couple of these hazy uh transparent uh files pgs that i have loaded in here i'm going to grab this one that's called haze top i'm going to bring that in and see that see what it does it kind of just gives me that haze over the top so i'm going to call this uh i'm going to call it haze top you can't stop me i'm doing it haze top i do want to be an overlay i'm gonna say next um i could i that's pretty so at 100% that's pretty snowy that's you know that's almost fog that's that almost i can't see the background so i might actually dial that back a little bit maybe two-thirds the way that that looks good say next and uh i'm going again i'm going to position it at the top of the window and make it 100% stretch all the way across my screen that's exactly what i want just a little bit of haze there um that looks good i it and then i might come in here and i have it as a separate piece but i have a haze on the bottom too that i could bring in um i'll call it same thing i call it haze bottom uh it's be an overlay i'm going to i'll go about the same you know 2/3 of the way actually no you know what it's it's at the bottom it's over snow i'm going to crank it all the way up and i'm going to position it at the bottom and we're stretch it all the way across all right so it's subtle but i can see see how it's it's my lines right here kind of fading off to white a little more just gives me a little bit more of that ha effect um if i move my model around too so if i was to drop my you know come in closer this i'd get some of it coming up under the bottom that that looks good i it um i'm going to i'm going to do this i'm going to go to view real quick and turn my axes off i don't these the blue line sticking right there okay yeah see it's coming together i how this is working out so i have this picture in the background some haze in the front and let's let's just keep going i'm going to go i have this falling snow png so it note something to note i have these saved as pgs because pgs will maintain the transparency so with that fog i didn't just get a white block all over everything i got that gradient so same thing is going to work with falling snow when i open that i'm going to see these snowflakes coming down but you see it it maintains a transparency there so we're going to call this one snow again an overlay and uh because it's just white i don't really want i don't want transparent flakes that you could do that but i'm going to go 100% yes and uh let's just go ahead and tile that no that doesn't look good that's not it's not a seamless texture you can see that there's a break right there that's ridiculous why stray from what i know works let's put a position put it in the middle make it as big as i can get oh yeah just that so i can hear some people asking why didn't i just have my haze haze and snow why wasn't that just all one absolutely you could do that but one of the things by having them separate i could come in here and i could come into my haze top and i could say let's you know let's dial that back even a little more let's make it a little bit clearer night and i can control that separately my snowflakes don't fade out when i do that because i have it as separate pieces likewise if i wanted to you know swap it out uh maybe i want to have a different background that i want to put in here i could do that quickly and easily by having that in there separate so having these se separate pieces uh just gives me more control on how i want that to be displayed um yeah and you see that let's let's close some stuff up so we can just kind of silently celebrate this majesty of i don't know i don't have more words to say there but it looks nice it looks good so obviously there's more work i could do i could turn some i have some lin hard lines showing up here i could soften but you can see quickly and easily i talked a lot so it wasn't as quick as it could have been but you have a lot lot of control over how that's displayed and you can turn those on and get a picture that no rendering no nothing and i'm still this is still a working model so i come in here and i could do whatever work i want while this is all here or if i wanted to i could at any point come into styles and just temporarily hide them that'll get me back to just my working model and then i can turn back on whenever i want to visualize that with the watermarks so i hope you got something out of that um it is a fun and it is a quick and an easy way to go in and you know create that you can and these these assets could be created by you you could go into photoshop or something that and make some snowflake shapes and scatter them around uh or i mean nowadays it's pretty easy to find and download a lot of these files so uh everything i here got here i googled for and uh you know if you're part if you have a a subscription service to any stock image or anything that there's great stuff out there that you don't even have to work on so but it's your call if you're a designer and you that kind of stuff go for it make some make some make some images and bring them in sketchup uh but it does let you real quick and easily get that depth look at that look this could be a christmas card photo right here uh hope you that if you did that click down below and if you don't already please do we create several videos and do a live model every week around here you be notified of all that if you most importantly though leave us a down below have you done this with watermarks you have a better way a quicker way to get this kind of look uh let us know in the comments we making these videos a lot we them even more when they showing something you want to see thank [music] you
