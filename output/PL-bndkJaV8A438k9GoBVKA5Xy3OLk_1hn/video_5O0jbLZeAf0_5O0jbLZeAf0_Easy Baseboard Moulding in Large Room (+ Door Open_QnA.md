##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

2025-07-23t11:05:06.085093 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- here today i want to with you a couple of tips that will hopefully make the process of adding crown molding to your model a little more [music] fun now i don't know about you but who doesn't crown molding or at least who doesn't modeling crown molding so as you can see behind me we are going to add some to a little interior design model that i have but i want to point out that it's not all fun in games there are a couple things that we need to consider especially when the fact that the molding has to go through openings or doors or the fact that you are using a complex profile so let's go ahead and look at all of those different things right now so i've got my molding i'm actually already done see quick video we can just stop there but i don't know about you it's probably a good idea to start from the beginning together so we can see the whole process i'm just going to come over here and erase my molding so what i have instead is a four group and a wall group that's it i'm just starting the process of detailing out my interior model here and what i want to do is think about how i want to approach this now i already know that i can use the me tool um in order to make the molding but i want to think about what am i following do i want to come and grab the the wall group here and then go this way but then i stop and then i have to come over here and grab this wall group and then do it again so do i want to do it on the uh manually so i've cut a few options now i don't know if this is the best way but this is the way my brain says to do it it actually says don't go along the wall at all in fact go along the floor let's start by copying a piece of the floor off the side i'm going to do that because i want to kind of go back and forth between being able to see what the crown molding looks in context but also being able to work with it a little bit independently so you can see just you know exactly what i'm doing every step of the way so here if i turn on my x mode and i kind of zoom in you can see that the floor group is actually does not the wall the floor group goes all the way to the outer edge of the wall but not the inner one so for me the first step that i want to do is sort of get a profile that i can tell my crown molding to so i'm going to pop in here and i'm going to say intersect faces with model now be careful because if you've got furnishings and a bunch of other stuff it may intersect with everything now i've got nice fresh model so i can do that with confidence but just again keep in mind where you are in the process it may or may not be something you may want to actually intersect with selection and select the walls instead but up to you depends on the model you're working on so you can see what happened there if i undo that because i was talking i'm going to do that again come over here select intersect faces with model and watch this is the reason why i pulled this to the side because you can't see it with the walls is now i've got this much more detailed profile it goes in and out out and around that's where my built-in cabinets and my kitchen counter and my bookshelf and all that stuff's going to go so now i actually have not the outer group anymore but i have the inner line that represents where i want my crown molding to go and you can see here that even if i wanted it to go around the columns all i have to do is just pull that column back just the width of the crown molding and now all of a sudden you can see what that inner group looks not worried if it's going to go behind my fridge and stuff i'm just going to go ahead and ignore that i know some of you probably are noticing that why go through the effort actually i'm not this is the easier way to do it i've got my profile ready now i need uh sorry i've got my path ready now i need my profile so if i zoom way in and i'm going to use the right arrow key so i can lock this along an axis i'm going to type in one comma four because that's kind of the size that i want to use so it's very small so i'll zoom in and then i select the path that i want so not just the path but actually the face that represents the path that i want and then come over here to me and then click me and then click this this profile once and you can see there it is i've got all of this done now i have to be careful though because right now i this is on the they're all on the same group together so what i might want to do first don't have to do this but you may want to come in and think about giving it a material first and the reason why is because then when you do that when you do that me step you can then rightclick it and say select all on the same material and then select and then you can come over here sorry not select make group so now my molding is independent is grouped independently from my face now i to do that just helps me to know that everything is sort of safe and does not stick to each other so let's talk about those openings maybe it's best here to pop back into the model with the walls so that you can see exactly what i mean by openings there's a doorway there now that profile that i did here it's so simple all i got to do is just push and delete so in two clicks i can just get rid of that molding because i'm using a relatively simple profile we're going to do this in just a second with a harder one you can see what i felt when i did this when i was testing some different methods i felt doing the whole room in one click including the columns um and then pushing out the doorways that that was sort of the easier way to go was pretty quick actually it was slow because i was talking but was actually pretty fast if i was to do that over again now but what if you have a more complicated profile because it push pulled then maybe isn't the best solution so let's look at uh an alternative way to basically accomplish the same task so what i'm going to do is go back in we're going to delete we're going to go into my floor group since i grouped those separately i'm going to delete my molding and we're going to do this one more time so same thing i'm going to come over here i'm going to say one comma four and i'm going to also paint this a material i maybe paint it a little bit lighter just so i can see because it's going to be a little bit more complicated i want to make sure i can see all of the details that i'm going to draw so start with with my arc tool and i'm just making this up so if you're a woodworker or molding expert out there just you know forgive me i just for this demo i just wanted something that has kind of an interesting shape to it something that you know looks plausible and and i'm just going to stop it there so find that tangent so i don't need that bit there so same process applies i've applied a material to that so i'm going to select my same face group u my same floor face come over here grab the me and in one click there it is so then i'm going to come over here and same thing i did before select all them same material and make that a group okay so now i've got my group let's pop back over and see how it looks in context it looks good but as i said you cannot just push pull this anymore doesn't want to do that it's too complex it's got all this extra geometry well you probably thinking why don't you just use the eraser tool all right let's try that i'm going to erase problem is i just lost my top face and again now i'm you know it's just erasing i'm going to end up losing information that i don't want to lose so i'm going to undo that a different way to think about this would be to turn this profile or turn this crown molding into a solid so right now it is a solid so a solid basically means there's no lines there's no edges it's complete it's got the it's got a bottom face there's no holes if you have a solid group this then you can just bring in a solid group that you can then use to create what i'm calling a cutting component so by a cutting component i mean something that you can use let me actually make this a different i'm going to group that come in here push this up and pull this back out maybe change the color that a little bit so basically what that means is is that you can if this is a solid which it is and this is a solid which it is then you can basically say i want to take this object here and i can open up my solid tools palette and i want to find this one here that says subtract i want to subtract this from this and then there you go it's gone so that's how easy it is now i'm going to do that one over again because if you noticed i actually have more than one opening that i need to cut so i actually can turn on my hidden geometry and i can come in here and i'm just going to unhide that because you can see i did that same step but i already placed one two 3 four and five so all of these are just loose geometry they're just little extruded rectangles and they are also a solid group so they're both solid so i'm going to do the same thing i want to take these and i want to subtract them from my crown molding so i have to make sure that these are in the same subgroup so subtract those from my crown molding and there you go it's punched out all of my holes all at once and it does not matter how complex the geometry is it'll just punch it because it's a solid now i've got my nice ornate detailed crown molding you can see how fast that was now i'm ready to move on to lay out my furniture and i'm good to go so i'm going to leave you there in fact actually i'm not going to leave you quite yet i want to plug behind me now you know me i to plug stuff um if you the model that we're working on and you want to see that step but a little bit slower and also with a lot more detail as far as what came before and then of course what's coming after you can check out our course on commercial interiors here on sketchup campus that's learn. sketchup.com there'll be a link in the description and then you can go through not just that lesson on crown molding but you can go through a lot of these other lessons for doing the walls and doing the adding materials and of course setting up camera views and getting ready to export your scene when you're all done so i hope you learned something new i that hope you had as much fun working with molding as i did and i'm going to leave you with thank you and see you next time [music]
