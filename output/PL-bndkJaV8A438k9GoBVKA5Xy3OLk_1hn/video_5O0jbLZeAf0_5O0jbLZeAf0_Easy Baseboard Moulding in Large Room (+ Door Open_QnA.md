## üéØ Your Objective
Answer every extracted question with a complete, accurate, and tutorial-specific response.

## üßæ Input
Extract from transcripts

## üß† Instructions
For each question:

1. **Locate the relevant answer in the transcript**
2. **Only answer if the transcript actually covers the topic**
3. **Be honest: say "This topic is not covered in this tutorial" if needed**
4. **Answer in a clear, actionable, and specific way:**
   - Include the tool/method used
   - Describe on-screen steps or UI interactions
   - **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
   - **Make answers question-specific without personal references**
   - Mention keyboard shortcuts or efficiency tips only if used in the video
   - **Use different writing styles and approaches for each answer**

5. **Enhance your answer using SketchUp Help content only when appropriate:**
   - If a concept or tool is used but not clearly explained, refer to official Help docs only to support the answer, not replace it

6. **Ensure answer uniqueness:**
   - **Never repeat the same explanation pattern** across different questions
   - **Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure** for each answer
   - **Use different examples and references** from the transcript for each question
   - **Make each answer feel distinct and original**

### Example:
**Q:** How is the Follow Me tool used in this tutorial?
**A:** The Follow Me tool is used to extrude a curved profile along a circular path to create crown molding. To use the Follow Me tool, select the path first, then click on the profile you want to follow. While using the tool efficiently, it's essential to note that it works by extruding a face along a preselected path.

**Q:** How do I add openings in the crown molding?
**A:** To add openings in the crown molding, turn the profile or group into a solid, and then use the "Subtract" tool from the Solid Tools palette. Select the solid group containing the molding and the opening geometry, and then subtract it from the original solid group.

**Q:** How do I create a complex profile for the crown molding?
**A:** To create a complex profile for the crown molding, start by drawing an arc using the Arc Tool. Adjust the tangent points to achieve the desired shape. Then, select the face representing the path and use the Follow Me tool to extrude it along the circular path.
