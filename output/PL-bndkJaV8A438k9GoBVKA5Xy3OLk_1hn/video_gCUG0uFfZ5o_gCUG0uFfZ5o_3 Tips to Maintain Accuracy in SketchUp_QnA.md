##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're want to talk about maintaining accuracy while modeling and sketchup so we hear this kind of thing a lot that oh you know sketchup's great for conceptual modeling or just massing but not really for details or exact dimensions um the thing is sketchup is as accurate as you need it to be so depending on the steps you take you can have insane accuracy fractions of fractions of inches very very minute 0.0 1 in i don't know very small dimensions but you do have to be intentional about it it's not going to automatically assume what you want and make things the right dimensions or the right accuracy you have to tell it how to do that and good news i'm going to show you how to do that right now let's hop in all right so i have this this model this is a a a 3d printed part that i created and you can see by teddy's feet right here this is not a big piece right this is uh it's a couple inches wide it's it's not huge um i picked this because it does have a bunch of small little details on it and uh obviously this this is the kind of thing that i might run into if i'm i'm concerned about detail i want i want want these small details to be correct i want these accurate uh that sort of thing and they were there this was this printed perfectly absolutely perfectly um so i'm going to look at some some issues that people run into so i have started just my standard when i model in sketchup 90% of the time i'm modeling modeling something architectural so the template i use for that the default is set for architectural units so to check what you're modeling you're going go to to window and go to model info that's going to pull up model info right here and the last tab right here is units we're going to talk about everything pretty much everything here on units so i said this is my default is architectural and i have my architectural set to a 16th inch uh precision and then my area and volume are square in and then i have that set to4 inch square so this is how i do most of my modeling um again 16inch accuracy is just something i'm used to this is where where i came up doing design work was with accuracy of about a 16th of an inch you can always make that finer go up to a 64th of an inch or if that's too much you just go to a full solid inch not nothing more more uh finite or or detailed than that but this is where i do my most of my work this works great for architectural modeling if i'm going in modeling you know framing something or modeling a building or something along those lines this is the perfect setup if i get into something this what i have on my screen where i'm modeling these teeny tiny details i if we come look at let's look at some of this so this span across this opening is 516 this screw hole right here is an eighth of an inch so i'm looking at some pretty small details uh that's less than an eighth of an inch there so this would not be the template to use for this model i would definitely want to change so one of the things that people run into i'm going to say immediately and and complain about their lack of accuracy is they have something this set when they should be using much smaller dimensions so one of the things i would recommend is if you are doing something that requires a high level of detail is use something more decimal switch from architectural to decimal you can still use inches but in this this case it's not going to round the nearest 16th of an inch it's going to actually give you whatever that number is you want so you can go one two three four five six decimal places past zero or you can always what i tend to do is when i go into to modeling is i will actually flip this over to millimeters and actually do most of my work in millimeters instead of putting in uh you know fraction or very very small inches so that's my number one thing that i'd recommend make sure you you have your measurement units set up to the precision you need for the thing you're doing and this goes both ways too so if i am modeling a house don't model a house to you know 0.000000001 inch um not because that's not a real thing but because i'm just going to advocate for people who frame houses most measures don't have those numbers on it so um if you are doing something that you of course will want to flip back to something architectural and have a realistic dimension here um one of the other things that people run into with problems and and i know this is on by default is enable length snapping let me give you an example of how this hurts people so say i want to draw a line to this point right and i want to come over here i'm going to pick a point arbitrarily pick right here and i want to dra draw that back to here now the issue with enable length snapping is along this line if you watch my see my length down lower right corner watch as i move my mouse see how it's jumping at 11/16th at a time if i get in here close to this point that point is not the only point possible there's also less than a 16th inch away there's another snap point so if you're not insanely conscious and watching very very closely to make sure you're hitting those points it's super easy for length snapping to grab that other point so some people go oh well i'll make that simple no problem i'm just going to come in here and make that a really small unit whoops now now no problem no that's actually a bigger problem because now your other snap points are really close to that point and it's even harder to find whether or not you're hitting that right so my recommendation is generally just to turn enable l snapping off off i know some people want to use that a grid it's always going to be everything's going to be on this perfect grid but the fact is unless you are even more vigilant about every start point and end point being on an endo length snapping is not going to help you out with that so there are certain very very general situations where i'm building with you know exact bricks exact dimensions everything is one foot by one foot by one foot or something along those lines where that might be helpful but generally speaking this is going to give you additional snap points which are not where you want them so here's what i'm talking about with length snapping off see this i don't have i'm not snapping i'm just moving moving along smoothly and then as soon as i get here jump i'm on the point or i'm off and there's no there's no no uh additional snap point that i accidentally hit to so that is definitely a thing you want to consider if you're working on maintaining accuracy and exact dimensions disable snap length snapping turn that off um same thing goes for angle units right here uh if you are doing a bunch of stuff where you're rotating things or or drawing arcs something that um length angle snapping is kind of nice actually i use it because if if i'm rotating everything's probably going to be at 45 30¬∞ or 60¬∞ i don't want to do a whole lot of weird angles outside of that so for me this is kind of nice but if you're doing a bunch of stuff where you're going to you know i i need to snap to 15.9 degrees and not 15 you might want to consider turning angle snapping off there all right the final thing i want to throw out there for maintaining accuracy so if you do those things if you if you turn off length snapping you set to a dimension that or a unit type that makes sense for the size of model you're doing that's going to help a lot but every once in a while stuff still can get off you can sometimes depending on how if i go to snap to a point depending on the view that i'm looking at so if i'm looking right here it's going to be really easy to snap to that point if i'm right here then all of a sudden i've got all these other points are showing up under here uh turning xray on says gives me a whole bunch of extra spots i can snap to so it's it's still possible to snap to points that aren't where you want and getting something off aaxis or in incorrect that sort of thing so one of the things i recommend if you're trying to maintain high level of accuracy is over here in styles if i look at styles go to the edit tab and there in my my edges right here if i roll scroll down here all the way to the bottom the color is set to all the same if i switch that to by axis this is a really cool thing and it highlights all of the edges that are parallel to the main axes so if i'm modeling something that doesn't have a bunch of curves or or weird lines going off which you know frankly a lot of my models do conform to the red green or blue axes for their geometry this is great because it will show you anything that's off axis so my curves obviously fall off axis that makes sense um you can see i have a couple look at this right here this whole wall right here is not on axes on axis on a i forget which one's the plural so if i pull my line across here so the green axis is so this should actually be back here so i can grab this come in here grab this edge move it back to here there you go see those lines turned green that means they're back on axis now so that is a great help so anytime you're working with geometry and you want to maintain and make sure everything is straight and flush i would recommend checking out color by axis so those are three tips working the right units working the right uh precision of units take off length snapping i know it sounds going to help you but you have to be twice as vigilant with leg snapping on to make sure you don't hurt yourself and then check out color by axis so just a quick video to to mention a couple of those things and hopefully give examples realistic examples you can see how or why you might want to use that um it's of course there dep everybody uses sketchup differently there's so many different things you could model with sketchup so many ways you can model it that there's different solutions for different things that people model so uh not going to say that this is everybody conforms to this one needs a model the way that i do but those tips are going to help if you've ever had issues where you created a models and then you end up off on a dimension or or something's not quite right that should help you out if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though please leave us a down below we want to hear if there's other tips this that you use to maintain accuracy or if you have a general tip for sketchup you think we should show in a video or if you run into problems and you would us to make a video to help you out of it we'd to hear that too making these videos a lot we' them even more they showing something you want to see thank you [music]
