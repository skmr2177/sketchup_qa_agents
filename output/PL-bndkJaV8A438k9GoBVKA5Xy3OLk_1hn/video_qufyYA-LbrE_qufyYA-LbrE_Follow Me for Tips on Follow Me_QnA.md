##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this week let's focus on me now the me tool is some other sketchup tools in that it's pretty versatile and you can do a lot of different things with it also some other tools it can be a little finicky and sometimes the results are what you'd expect and sometimes they may not be so let's work through a few scenarios that hopefully will give you some advanced ideas on our me will work and making it work for you this is not an introduction to me so if you've never used the tool before we do have some videos on that but we're going to push your use of me a little further thing let's look at is this typically when you're using me you often have a nice obvious place to start if you me shape something this so if i click up here or my path hit me which i have as a keyboard shortcut and click rate but sometimes you might have something this where there's not an obvious path what if we wanted to cut a shape inside here it's easy to draw a shape on the outside but we want to draw shape on the inside not a problem let's just hide this surface i have it on a keyboard shortcut i'm going to hide it and the other tip that i want to make in this example is that you should pretty much always at least i prefer to draw a simple rectangle and then draw your more complex me shape it's so much easier to draw on a rectangle than to try and draw especially arcs but even any of these lines out in 3d space so i suggest draw a simple rectangle and then you can draw on that shape now we can simply select this top surface hit me and through the edit menu unhide or through a keyboard shortcut you can unhide and that is one way to use me on a shape that may not have an obvious starting point all right let's look at our next example uh this is an example of something i was 3d printing recently a little storage box but it's very small and i wanted to put a chamfer on the base of it so i'll select this and hit me and click on this little that looks okay oh nope you see it didn't resolve this tight corner and i suspect we're going to get the same here doesn't these tight corners on this small shape so let me undo and this is a component and that's important because now we're just going to make a copy of this and with that copy we're going to scale it up now i'm not editing the component i'm scaling sort of the outer shell of it but now i'm going to edit the component this larger version and do the same thing select this surface hit me and on the larger version it does resolve those tight corners here and here and this is a trick that's actually useful just any time you're you're using detail in sketchup and it doesn't quite work the way you'd expect you can make your geometry a component create a much larger scale of it and if we look at our small version just by running those operations on that larger version it also work here this is not a guarantee that you can always resolve a very tight corner with me you can create a scenario that just is way too tight but it's worth knowing about that if you are having trouble with small details try scaling it up let's look at our next example this case i'm going to draw an arc here pull this up and i were to try and run this shape on this arc the results are less than spectacular because me is going to the path the arc we drew didn't resolve into this shape very well it didn't resolve into it in a purely perpendicular direction and so it has this overlap now if this is what we needed we could select some of these surfaces and intersect them and have to clean this up manually but we could do it however if we anticipate that instead when we draw this initial arc what we can do is simply draw a small starting line that is perpendicular so that one in the green direction that one in the red and then when i draw this arc we have these little segments that should help this geometry resolve much nicer it's this this this and this as my path hit me and that may be what we had expected initially but now we know why and how to create some small little perpendicular lines and then draw the arc with those as our aids in this example let's say we have this geometry and we're working on the interior we want to create some trim well simple enough and we hit me that looks great and if all we were doing was working on the inside that may be just fine but it does change the geometry of our walls and maybe we wanted this trim to be separate so let me undo we could do a couple things here now one that you might do is simply select this select these edges and then i could group those and then run this on the inside now that's separated now i didn't have to grab the path and make it part of the group you could but for example if i select the path delete it if i select the path from the outside of the shape group hit me i could still right click on the shape group say edit group click and i still get the nice results the me is put inside the group so this is great i do want to warn you though there's a this scenario works let me show you a scenario that does not work let me undo that again because typically you might have your walls here grouped separately so i've got the shape group and i've got the walls group but you might say well it should still work right i can select the path hit me i'm going to right click and close that group and then right click and edit this group and click to finish it but what i have found as you see this is not what we want when i have tried to do this across groups or components and i get too fancy it does not do what i would expect so let me undo that and instead i'm going to take this i'm going to cut it edit the walls group and paste it in place so as long as i'm not closing out of one component opening another and jumping across components here i'm editing the group so i'm still selecting simple path if you go me right click edit and click on this for the results so this can be something that is useful just keep in mind that if you're getting really fancy with jumping in and out of components it may not work for you the last example let's look at is something that we see often at least i see it a lot in the uh 3d warehouse and that is that people don't realize or don't appreciate the need to change the default number of segments in circles and arcs so this again is an example where i would recommend drawing a simple rectangle which i did and then we'll erase what we don't need to me that looks good or does it maybe i want more detail in the segments around here but if i look at hidden geometry there's a whole lot of detail on this lip and that's unnecessary because we've added a lot of unnecessary geometry let me back up i'm going to take the circle go to entity info i'm going to change this maybe to twice as many segments and this top arc was the default 12 but maybe it only needs four maybe five it's not an exact science how many just be aware and be a little bit proactive in saying okay i don't need that many down here so i'm going to leave these both as 12 though now let's run this again i think this looks better but because that top edge doesn't have as much geometry even though we increase the segments of the circle we probably have less geometry overall or if it's the similar we have a better looking ball so keep in mind and always adjust your arcs and circle segment count for the best results all right that was a mad rush through several examples and tips for me but hopefully something in there was useful to you something you didn't uh weren't aware of before we try and create these videos every week so if you are not please do but definitely let us know what you thought of this or if you have some other suggestions either for this video tips and tricks for me or for any video that we can create and help you on your sketchup journey thanks as always see you next time foreign
