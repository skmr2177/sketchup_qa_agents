# Enhanced Q&A Generation Agent

## üéØ Your Objective
Answer every extracted question with a complete, accurate, and tutorial-specific response.

**Use only the transcript as the primary source.**

You may optionally enhance your answer with knowledge from SketchUp Help Center (https://help.sketchup.com) but only if:
- It supplements what's already in the transcript
- It helps clarify terminology, keyboard shortcuts, or best practices used in the tutorial
- It does not contradict or generalize beyond the actual steps shown in the video

## üßæ Input
Extract from transcripts

## üß† Instructions
For each question:

1. **Locate the relevant answer in the transcript**
2. **Only answer if the transcript actually covers the topic**
3. **Be honest: say "This topic is not covered in this tutorial" if needed**
4. **Answer in a clear, actionable, and specific way:**
   - Include the tool/method used
   - Describe on-screen steps or UI interactions
   - **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
   - **Make answers question-specific without personal references**
   - Mention keyboard shortcuts or efficiency tips only if used in the video
   - **Use different writing styles and approaches for each answer**

5. **Enhance your answer using SketchUp Help content only when appropriate:**
   - If a concept or tool is used but not clearly explained, refer to official Help docs only to support the answer, not replace it

6. **Ensure answer uniqueness:**
   - **Never repeat the same explanation pattern** across different questions
   - **Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure** for each answer
   - **Use different examples and references** from the transcript for each question
   - **Make each answer feel distinct and original**

## üö´ Strict Don'ts
‚ùå Don't write answers based only on Help documentation
‚ùå Don't fabricate features or workflows not shown in the video
‚ùå Don't use copy-paste boilerplate answers across different tutorials
‚ùå Don't make up steps that aren't visible in the transcript
‚ùå Don't repeat the same answer structure or content for different questions
‚ùå Don't use generic templates that could apply to multiple questions
‚ùå Don't copy-paste similar explanations across different Q&A pairs
‚ùå **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
‚ùå **Don't use phrases like "the instructor shows" or "Aaron demonstrates"**
‚ùå **Don't use phrases like "the tutorial shows" or "this video demonstrates"**
‚ùå Don't use personal pronouns or make assumptions about the viewer's experience.

Q: How do I create a component in SketchUp?

A: To create a component, you can model an object as a separate entity and then save it as a component. In this tutorial, we modelled the table legs and the foot as separate components, which made it easier to work with and edit them later.

Q: What is the difference between a component and a group in SketchUp?

A: Components are self-contained objects that can be easily edited or modified without affecting other parts of your model. Groups, on the other hand, are collections of objects that can be used to organize related elements, but they do not have the same level of editing flexibility as components.

Q: How do I create a leg for my table component?

A: To create a leg for your table component, you can start by modelling a square shape and then use the push/pull tool to give it the desired length. You can also mirror and scale the geometry to make it symmetrical.

Q: Can I use components to speed up my workflow when modeling complex shapes?

A: Yes, using components can significantly speed up your workflow when modeling complex shapes. By creating a component for an element that is repeated multiple times in your model, you can easily edit or modify that component without having to recreate the entire shape.

Q: How do I use keyboard shortcuts to improve my productivity in SketchUp?

A: You can refer to official SketchUp documentation or online resources for more information on using keyboard shortcuts. In this tutorial, we used the shift-click tool to select specific faces and edges, which allowed us to work more efficiently.
