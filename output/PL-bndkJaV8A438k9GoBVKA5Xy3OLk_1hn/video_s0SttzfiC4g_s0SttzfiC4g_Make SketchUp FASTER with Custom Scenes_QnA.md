##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's and today we're going to talk about making fast rendering working scenes in [music] sketchup so yeah we're in a bit of a uh a scene phase apparently talking about how we can use scenes to uh you know automate some of the things you do in sketchup as your modeling so we talked about sections and and some other things this time i want to talk about uh you know what we would cost call a fast rendering scene so there's certain settings in sketchup that take a little bit more time and a little more processor to put onto your screen and if you have a set of styles and viewport properties that don't use any of those you end up with a faster modeling session so we'll talk about what those are and we'll take a look at that right now all right so here we have uh not a fast and this this is not by no means is it slow this is a okay siiz model there's some entourage there's quite a bit of geometry but it's not a huge model by any means um but you can see some of the stuff that we got going on in here uh so there's shadows on the ground i have reflective materials i have an environment turned on uh i have profiles you can see my edges are a little bit thicker than the rest so again makes for a beautiful looking model but it can slow things down sometimes so in fact in this one of the things that we'll see is as i start to rotate this uh i might i might get to a spot where my shadows disappear and then pop back in or uh again this is small enough that i'm not having issues with components but you can see in bigger models uh i'll see a little bit of lag when i try to to move around or edit my model so and i should point out i'm in 20125 which is the most performing version of sketchup ever so this is much better than it's ever been before but once i start getting a big model uh it can slow things down not just that but beautiful as this is the materials the shadows all that sometimes that stuff can actually get in the way as i model you have seen me do live models you know that one of my the way that i to model more than any other way is with white surfaces it just it's clean to me i can see the geometry there's no issues so i'm going to propose here a couple of scenes one which is my good-looking you know beauty scene we'll call this beauty uh and then another scene which is going to take me into my kind of working uh setup so let's let's talk about that so let we'll take this one right now before we do anything else we're going to say okay this right now is my beauty scene i want i want to hold on to this i want this to be uh something i can jump back to so i'm going to go right now up to scenes and i'm going to create a new scene just we've been doing in these recent videos i'm not going to leave everything turned on for scenes in fact i'm going to turn off most of it so i'm going to turn off turn off i'm going to turn off till i get down to style and fog i'm leave style and fog shadow settings and environment settings on and turn everything else off and i'll go ahead and create that new scene this is an update to the style so i'm going to say go ahead and create that do it and i'm going to rename this we're going to we just called it beauty we're going to stick with that this is my beauty scene so again because i didn't turn a bunch of these other things off i can jump to this scene which i mean there's only one so it's not jumping to much but you see it's rendering the scene from this only these properties so it doesn't matter where my camera is or anything that um now that's awesome let's talk about what it takes to make a fast scene so i want to create a scene where drawing to the screen happens instantaneously nothing so you can see right there as i rotate see how my shadow disappears and comes back that's again it's just rewriting uh figuring based on where my model is how the shadows fall so it's it just takes a second but let's create a scene where that's not an issue let's get everything cleared out so we're going to just come down here uh let's start with styles why not all right so first thing i was talking about was edges so edges are good i seeing edges edges make editing easier but profiles can take just a half a beat to go through and figure out where profiles every time are supposed to be every time i move my model around every time i orbit so i'm going to turn profiles off so you can see there we go we got now all edges are the same size there's no thicker ones that are on on the sides and then let's go into our faces and i'm going to change the so again this is the way i would do it i don't i'm already here in the comments but the beautiful materials they are beautiful but i'm going to go ahead and drop this down to just white surfaces there we go so we still have transparency we still have you know i can still see everything in here but it's all white it's all just painted one material quick easy um in fact i may even again to make this as fast as possible i may come to my transparency and make that faster also that's going to just again make it the quickest possible style i'm also going to turn off as much as it pains me you know i love ambient occlusion i think it just it makes my models look so much better but i'm going to turn that off too everything i just want this clean as possible style looking good um all right i'm going to go through here environments i'm going turn my environments off there's no interaction with the environments see my skydome went away i just got this the plain sketchup background looks good uh then the other thing i got in here is shadows i'm going to turn my shadows off so now i have what i would call almost the cleanest easiest thing to work in the only problem with this view is cuz i turned profiles off so any geometry that's rounded over anything that kind of disappears so this right here i don't that um a way that i do model regularly is to come into view and turn on hidden geometry not objects but just geometry that's going to give me dash lines in those spots where everything smoothed over where i would rely on a profile so this right here might be my quickest most performant way to work inside a sketchup this is going to go fairly fast this is going to render quickly um i this so i'm going to do this i'm going to do it i'm going to commit to it this is my modeling fast modeling scene so i'm going to go back up to scenes again with just style fog and shadow settings turned on i'm going to hit plus or create a new scene and this one i'm going to call modeling and now if i flip back and forth between these two you can see yes this is exactly what i wanted and i'm doing it from one view but obviously i could be in here i could be in here you know uh let's go let's go inside let's head in here and i could be working on this this desk right now maybe i'm i don't know moving around the information thing or something and uh let's see what does it look in my beauty scene i can flip over give it just a second to apply all the stuff o yeah that looks nice but i want to make some more changes i'm going to hop back over to modeling and uh move my computers or whatever but this is the just it's just a super fast way to jump in again not everybody likes modeling with all this turned off this is this is cutthroat this is the most stuff turned off i could possibly turn off to make it as fast as possible there's probably somewhere in between you'll get a very very performant modeling session but this is going to get me the quickest quickest fastest renders to the screen uh most performance and i can hop to it with just a single click of the mouse so i don't know it was never intentional i didn't think oh scenes are so cool and they're underused and let's talk about a bunch of way to do different kinds of working scenes but that's what happened i think this is the last one i don't have any other ideas of things that can tie to scenes maybe you do maybe you can think of a spot that uh i didn't i didn't include in scenes but this was i think probably where we should have started having a working scene versus that beauty scene uh and being able to click back and forth between them um yeah i i think this is a worthwhile thing to have and something we talked about we didn't really talk about with scenes you can save those into your template too so you could actually have a default template that already has those scenes set up um whether they be these scenes or the section scenes or any of those other scenes we've talked about you could actually make that part of your template maybe that'll be the next video is how to set up a template with scenes keep the scene thing going um if that's what you want if you this video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you be notified of all of them if you most importantly though do leave us a down below what do you think about these scenes is there a way to use scenes that i've skipped that you need to let me know about and would you to see how to set up a template so that these scenes are already part of it let me know we making these videos a lot we them even more or when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
