##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

2025-07-23t08:32:32.767787 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to model a wall [music] scon so for those of you who aren't as uh highend as me scon is a fancy word for a wallmounted light um so it's kind of a cool architectural detail it's functional because i said it is a light it brings light in um and the fact is sconces can look anything i mean there's there's things that are different shapes round square they look things you would hang on a wall um there there there's lots of different ways they could look uh we're going to keep it kind of simple but i want to put some cool details in there that's going to set what we model apart from maybe something else you might see let's hop in and check it out all right so we're going to put a wallcon up here first thing we need is a wall so i'm just going to use my rectangle tool draw a quick rectangle on the ground this pull it up and there we go we have a wall i'm going to triple click that and make it a group now we're going to create a scon to put on here i'm going to model this flat on the ground actually and make it a component that will snap up to the wall um so i'm going to this is i'm going to start with a fairly basic shape so i'm going to the base of this that sits on the wall is going to be a square rectangle this i'm going to pull that up that and that's going to be the base plate basically that sits on the wall i'm going tri triple click that and uh we're just going to throw a dark color on there so you know i don't black i'll use this charcoal or tungsten sorry uh and i'm going to triple click that and make it a group i black i'm just saying i don't use black as fill colors because i to be able to see the edges against my colors for my material so i'll grab that make it a group um and now my scon i want to have it an extruded half circle it's going to sit up on the wall so i'm going to do this i'm look at this side this i'm going to draw a circle right here pull across about that big that looks good i'm going to cut that across get rid of this and then i'm going to pull this out this way a little bit and i'll pull it up this way so that's pretty much what my scon is going to look on the on there um i want to go a little bit further with this so i'm going to start i'm going to grab uh this color and i'm going to put that on ends that so this will be the part that lights up um no you know what i'm going to go a little bit further that i'm going i'm going to grab this edge right here i'm going to option copy it in that and i'm going grab this i'm going to option copy that in uh about the same was about 716 before there we go and then just fill that in that as well that looks cool i that um let's go further let's keep going um i want to i'm gonna draw a rectangle over here i want to put a unique pattern on here maybe something that looks it's cloth or weaved or something else other than just plain white plain white works but let's go let's do something else we're here to learn stuff so let's learn some stuff i'm going to go to something i wouldn't normally think of brick let's go to brick and i'm going to grab this brick texture and i'm going to fill it in here um yeah i that that's going to work for what i want to do uh i'm going to right click go to texture and hit position i'm going do a couple things i'm going to turn it so it's vertical this and then i'm going to make it considerably smaller that so that's the texture i want to put on here not almost the texture um but you can see when you when you do that it looks some kind of fabric if i'm zoomed out uh if you didn't know it was brick you'd probably not catch that it was brick but we're going to go a little bit further because i'm going to take that i'm going to go back to uh my in model materials and here's here it is i'm going to double click on it when i double click on it it shows up down here i now have the ability to edit this and i'm going to edit it by jumping back over here to this tool any of the color editing tools would work if i want to use sliders instead but what i want to do is i want to make this make it lighter so it looks you know it's a light is what it's supposed to be and then let's make it paler as well um might be a little i think that'll work that looks good all right and let's uh let's come in here whoops and let's sample that and apply it here and there we go that's a cool looking uh little sconce i how that looks um very unique uh i'm going to triple click that make it its own group so now i have two groups this group here this group here and i'm going to take both of those and i'm going to say make component i'm going to call that ascon because that's what the name of the thing is and then i'm going to also say uh let's set snapping to i'll just say any that way if i have a spot i want to put it that's not vertical i can and then let's hit create when we do that let's go ahead and close our windows here um this scon now should show up in our components and what i should be able to do is just drag this and then click on it i'm sorry not drag click on it and then when i drop it on the wall it snaps right to it so it come down this edge wall here snap it on there um and because we made it snap uh to any surface i could put it flat on surfac that that's just glue to that's that's pretty simple pretty easy and uh get rid of those extra ones i don't need that i just want this that looks cool but how do we take that maybe a little what how do we go another level higher the materials kind of a nice effect um what what could we do to make this a little bit more how do we do more i'm so glad i asked so one thing i know if because this is a component i can edit this one down here and then whatever change i make here is going to show up to any of these that are in the model which in this case is this one right here uh if we wanted to we do this too we could take this one and we could bring that over here straight across and then if we make a change to this it's going to actually happen to both that's just basic components any change i make to this one is going to show up in both so this is kind of cool because i can make changes as i go even after they're installed in the model um let's go a little further and let's i want to actually add some light to this now sketchup is not a renderer sketchup does not go through and figure out where light sources are and how light bounces off there's no ray tracing or anything that but i do have some things i can do to emulate lights in my model so one of the things i can do is i can actually import an image of uh some fading colors and use that as light so i'm going to come in here let me show you what i'm talking about i'm going to import i have an image on my desktop and this right here wall light is the what i'm talking about so i'm going to say import that and i'm just going to drop that boom right behind that light scale it to the right size i'm slide it over a little bit slide down a little bit cool and then what i can do is i can take that so you see that p that picture that image is a picture of translucent uh yellowy material that fades off into nothing so you can see look at look at my blue lines right back here my blue axis you can see it behind as i get closer to the center it disappears all the way behind that light all this was was a radial gradient that i put onto uh i i can't remember a 300x 300 pixel square simple super super simple uh not a whole lot of work i know people are going to ask for this file in uh the the comments i i don't have a way to it through youtube so no can't give it to you but it is super easy to make you could you i have faith you could do this yourself um all right so let's let's see what that looks when we put it in the model so right now it's separate here's my component here is the imported image so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to go to edit and say cut then i'm going to open the component by double clicking and i'm going to say edit paste and place soon as i do that it shows up on both of them but wait why didn't it show up on here so what's happening right now is the back of this surface which is where that image at where that image at where that image is at is right in line with the wall so it's causing a little bit of an issue so if i grab this i slide it up i can see it's right there but i have two surfaces on top of each other so if i take this wall and i slide it actually won't let me slide because i'm glued too here's what i'll do i'll come in here and i'll take this material and i will move it up this i'm going to move it up i'm going to exaggerate a little bit i'm going to move up a little bit higher and then by doing that you can see that gets rid of the fighting between that plane and the wall wall a little bit taller to take full advantage of that material i put on there there we go all right so that's kind of cool it's i said it's a real simple lighting effect this is now a part of the component so anytime i grab this and bring it in it just going to show it's just going to show up that but uh i that i want to go just i you know i to just push it i to go a little bit further let's go just a touch further here's what i want to do i want to actually because the way this is built light wouldn't hit down below here or up above here we kind of have v's of no light coming out um so i want to emulate that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to temporarily take my image i'm going to drop it back down to flush with the back that's just going to make it easier to make that edits i'm about to make and what i'm going to do is i am going to take a spot right about there and i'm going to draw a line out to there this is not very specific uh but then i'm going to take that edge and i'm going to say okay now copy that hold on my modifier key to make a copy and just find the middle there and i'm going to take both of these edges and i'm going to say the same thing copy it again hit the modifier key to copy and grab the red and pull the the red to the middle here all right so now i have those four edges um this currently is not a texture or material this is currently an image to get it so it's an editable texture i have to right click and explode it as soon as i do that it drops into context with the rest of this um now what i want to do is i want to cut out these two pieces to do that though i do have to close up this face so i'm going to come here to the end of this one take it over to this one see as soon as i did that see how it broke same thing on this side click right here drag it across to here that side breaks all right now little bit of quick cleanup erase erase erase and there we go erase erase erase oh it's looking good look at how that breaks but i have these edges on here so i'm just going to in my eraser i'm going to hit shift shift is hide and i'm going to go around and just hide the edges that that and then when we exit out now look at the shadow that i just created there oh look at that so we'll make this a little bit bring this home just a touch i'm going to go into the wall group and i'm going to color that with a just a little bit darker color and then uh yeah there you go so kind of a cool i said sconces themselves can look anything so the idea of drawing a scon which was my original idea for this that could be just about anything so simple model but by adding that image and then doing a little bit of editing to the image cutting it up a little bit uh i could see how that that worked out and i you'll notice this too uh when we made that a little bit darker my material didn't uh end up behind so i don't have z fighting issue that i had before uh either so that turned out kind of cool so yeah check that out quick and easy wall sconces with a lighting effect so this kind of took on a life of its own as i started putting this together i was looking at wall sconces and going wow there's so many options out there of geometry that i could put together uh this idea came through and i thought this is this is fun this is kind of a a cool way to take that add that little extra something to your sketchup model both between the materials that are actually on the lens part of the scon but then also just creating that that faux lighting situation i said sketchup's not a rendering engine so it's not going to go through and put a light source in it anything that that's just not it's sketchup's intended for model creation but that doesn't mean you can't take geometry and add a little bit of extra value a little bit of extra you know pop to your model using things a simple gradient texture try it out if you that video click down below and if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below is there anything in this video you caught that you learned something new um is there a different way you go about something similar to doing this or do you have an idea for a video something we've never covered before and you think would make a good video tell us about it in the comments down below we making these videos a lot we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [music]
