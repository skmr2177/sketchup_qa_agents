# Enhanced Q&A Generation Agent

## üéØ Your Objective
Answer every extracted question with a complete, accurate, and tutorial-specific response.

**Use only the transcript as the primary source.**

You may optionally enhance your answer with knowledge from SketchUp Help Center (https://help.sketchup.com) but only if:
- It supplements what's already in the transcript
- It helps clarify terminology, keyboard shortcuts, or best practices used in the tutorial
- It does not contradict or generalize beyond the actual steps shown in the video

## üßæ Input
Extract from transcripts

## üß† Instructions
For each question:

1. **Locate the relevant answer in the transcript**
2. **Only answer if the transcript actually covers the topic**
3. **Be honest: say "This topic is not covered in this tutorial" if needed**
4. **Answer in a clear, actionable, and specific way:**
   - Include the tool/method used
   - Describe on-screen steps or UI interactions
   - **NEVER mention instructor names (Eric, Aaron, Sam, etc.)**
   - **Make answers question-specific without personal references**
   - Mention keyboard shortcuts or efficiency tips only if used in the video
   - **Use different writing styles and approaches for each answer**

5. **Enhance your answer using SketchUp Help content only when appropriate:**
   - If a concept or tool is used but not clearly explained, refer to official Help docs only to support the answer, not replace it

6. **Ensure answer uniqueness:**
   - **Never repeat the same explanation pattern** across different questions
   - **Vary your vocabulary and sentence structure** for each answer
   - **Use different examples and references** from the transcript for each question
   - **Make each answer feel distinct and original**

## üö´ Strict Don'ts
‚ùå Don't write answers based only on Help documentation
‚ùå Don't fabricate features or workflows not shown in the video
‚ùå Don't use copy-paste boilerplate answers across different tutorials
‚ùå Don't make up steps that aren't visible in the transcript
‚ùå Don't repeat the same answer structure or content for different questions
‚ùå Don't use instructor name
... (rest of the do's and don'ts)

## Q&A

**Q1: How to make a pyramid with known height?**
A1: To make a pyramid with known height, draw a triangle from the midpoint in plane with the bottom face, set the length of the long edge to the desired dimension, rotate the triangle to the specific point using the Arc tool, and then select all the geometry and use the solid tools to intersect.

**Q2: How to make a pyramid with unknown height?**
A2: To make a pyramid with unknown height, use the protractor tool to set the angle of the faces. Draw a line from one edge to another, making sure it's exactly the desired length (in this case, 8), and then use the rotate tool to snap to the correct point on the triangle.

**Q3: What is the protractor TR protractor tool?**
A3: The protractor tool is used in SketchUp to draw lines at specific angles. It helps create pyramids with known or unknown heights by setting the angle of the faces.

**Q4: How to make a pyramid with a leaning ladder face?**
A4: To make a pyramid with a leaning ladder face, draw a line from one edge to another, making sure it's exactly the desired length (in this case, 8), and then use the rotate tool to snap to the correct point on the triangle.
