##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to

#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

2025-07-23t11:03:50.278447 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- it's time for design exercise how many different ways are there to make a four-sided pyramid in sketchup there it's here uh and i've compiled the total encyclopedic compendium to quote a hero of uh every single way there is to make a four-sided pyramid sketchup um it's not even worth trying to trump me in the comments because i've identified every single one no more no less and um so i'm just going to walk you through how to make each one right now these are them but uh we don't need them so let's delete them and start over i'm using a metric template for this uh all these triangles triangles all these pyramids are going to have a base a rectangular base of 1 meter by 1 meter and uh of course this is the first way the autofold this is the classic way in sketchup you uh make an x split this face up into four and then use the move tool uh without anything selected you can bring this middle point up as long as you're in the blue axis make sure you're not in any other direction uh you can use the up arrow to snap to that and let's say8 height there we go that's our first pyramid one thing to note with this method you're not going to have a bottom so you want to close that up it's just good practice to keep everything uh solid number two is what i call the center line stitch method so what that means is i'm going to use um inferencing here to inference this midpoint and then this midpoint or i can find the center of that square and draw it up again in that blue axis 8 and now i have my my peak of my pyramid i'm just going to as the name suggests stitch this together one by one couple things wrong with this pyramid it's inside out so i'll triple click uh and reverse faces this is also best modeling practice and of course we have an interior edge here that we don't need it's superfluous so i'll use xarray with x to get in there and delete it and now we have two identical ones in two different ways but we're just getting started uh the next method is is the push pole stitch method so i'll push this base up and i could either type in 08 or just inference this known value of 08 high and again i'll make that uh that x across the top as i did in the first example now i have my peak point here and what i'm going to do is stitch inside this uh rectangular prism you can't see anything when i'm doing that but if i turn on xray mode you can see that face was created and again peak down to the point peak to the point turn off x-ray mode yeah it's a little messy we got a little clean up to do um getting rid of that extra stuff we don't need and this one we can reverse this face and we have our pyramid that would be push pull stitch method okay we also have the pushpull move method which once i push this up again to that same height same kind of steps as before x on the top and this refers back to that original uh first case that we did with using autofold if i go to move without anything pre-selected i can select on these points on the vertices here and drag them down to their corresponding points on the base and i'm left with my pyramid and here's kind of a subway to do it i can also move the edges so i'll move this edge from this midpoint down to this midpoint and this one down to this one pyramid um alternatively you can see i moved from point i moved from edge i can also move from face which is you know four uh or not four but just edges that are co- planer identifying a face and i'll move all these down at once now i could you know move from a particular point but because i know this is exactly point8 high i can just choose any arbitrary point and then as long as i'm moving in that blue again i can either use the shift key to lock to it or press that up arrow key and then as long as i'm moving in the right direction as long as i'm moving down i can just type in 08 and i'll move exactly to the right spot to make our fourth pyramid uh if you are liking this video give us a down below but uh let's move on to number five number five is the we had to get to it eventually the me one of the me methods this is the me additive method is what i'm calling it so again i'm going to use that uh those midpoint differences to find the center of our uh base here and8 up and then i'm going to draw the triangle profile that i'll use for following me now me uses uh a path which is a series of connected edges so i'll select my edges that i want for my path select the me tool and select my profile and that my is the me additive method of making a pyramid which of course leaves the me subtractive method so in that case what i'm going to do is push pull up to that same height i'll use the line tool to go from this midpoint here down to one of the edges and uh as i alluded to earlier a face all geometry in sketchup is either edges or faces a face is just defined as the four uh co-planner edges that are connected so in this case instead of following selecting the path by getting these one by one i can just use the face for that because this is defined as those uh connected edges me profile pyramid bang okay um now we are going to start our next base not with a rectangle but with a line so this time i'm going to draw uh this triangle first again that same height and make that triangle uh this one is called the intersect with selection method which means we will need um two triangular prisms to intersect so i'll pull this long it doesn't really matter arbitrarily long as long as it um is long enough to overlap itself and then i'll triple click to select all this geometry and then what i want to do is rotate a copy of it 90¬∞ so that we our intersection is that pyramid so i'll hit q which is the rotate tool and it wants to snap to um the different planes here but i want it to stay on the blue plane so that up arrow key has been really helpful for us today we're going to use it again midpoint and and then i'm looking in this bottom uh tool tip area where it says copy toggle copy is option so i'm going to hit option i believe that's control on a pc and then now when i rotate that you can see i'm making a copy i could try to snap to 90¬∞ or i could just type in 90 and uh although these faces are overlapping they're not actually intersecting so triple click and right click to find the intersect faces uh on that right click uh menu and with selection intersect faces with selection now you can see that this edge breaks up those faces again i made kind of a mess but with just a little cleanup we can get to the point where all these extra edges are gone and we have our perfect pyramid once again now you may have been able to infer this but uh we're going to start in the same uh way that we started this last one we're going to use intersect but we're going to use intersect um with the solid tools uh and to do that we're going to the same steps as last time by making this two long uh triangular prism but before we rotate it we're actually going to triple click to select all that geometry and make this a group uh in order to use solid tools we need these items to be solid meaning they're watertight manifold no extra geometry no holes or anything and you can see an entity info and i select that that is a solid same kind of rotation here with that up arrow make a copy 90¬∞ and here is where we go to tools solid tools intersect wants me to select the first group the first solid and the second solid and that solid because we just intersected those to make our next pyramid great okay here's where things start to get a little tricky these were all the same height right we knew the exact uh dimension from the very peak all the way to the base but there's going to be situations probably where you're trying to draw a pyramid where you don't have all that information so if we do start with that same base again but we now know the the height of this pyramid uh sorry of this triangle we know this dimension okay not the peak to the base dimension but the kind of the long edge of the triangle and how we're going to do that is start drawing from this midpoint in plane with this bottom here that's going to be 8 and then we can um finish up that triangle to make this edge now i need to rotate this to a specific point but i don't know exactly where that point is one way to find it is we're going to inference that center again midpoint midpoint get the center i'll just draw this in the blue uh some arbitrary direction and i'm going to use the arc tool to solve this problem not uh using the a shortcut that'll get us to the two-point arc tool we want to go to regular arc here and then i'll start um with that red plane locked from this midpoint all the way to this end and then i can see coming along here as i get closer to this edge i can see that intersection point that is the point that i want right this end point right here is where i want to rotate this so again q for rotate starting at the midpoint this uh point of the triangle and then i can zoom in to snap right to that end point and i have this triangle selected rotate from the corner make a copy 3x we're inside out again and again we have that that one interior uh reference geometry piece which we can get rid of with x-ray okay great that's how we did it with the uh the known height of the triangle which again was 8 okay so what if i don't know the height of the peak to the base i don't know the the length of this triangle height but i do know the angle that i want to make a a pyramid i know the angle of the faces here's where our protractor tr protractor tool comes in handy so i'll use the protractor i'll lock to uh here the green plane and then go from this midpoint to this one um some angle let's make it a weird angle 47.8 okay and then i just need the same thing from this side 47.8 and i have this intersection piece between those two guides which will let me stitch together that pyramid as i did before edit delete guides reverse and now this pyramid has sides of angle exactly 47.8 degrees great that's the protractor angle uh method as is what i'm calling that don't worry we still have one to go this one the leaning ladder face method um okay so i don't know any dimension on this pyramid that i want to make except this i know this edge i know this exactly i want this edge to be8 i'm just loving 8s uh on this video so how we're going to do that is again draw in this direction over here this is an arbitrary amount i'll start from this corner and i want to go 08 exactly i'll select that edge use q for rotate and go from this to here now i might have to zoom in to see this exact point i want to get to the inference here we go right there from radius on edge then i know that this this line is exactly 08 and when i clean this up um we're going to make this one a little bit more interesting so i'm actually going to do this off axis a bit um i know so it's a little bit harder to inference the middle of that square using my midpoint trick here so i'll just do that x trick that we did in the very first uh example and draw this up again an arbitrary amount uh now i want this again to rotate so last time i used that red snap point uh snapping to that plane doesn't work the same no matter which plane i snap to it's not the right one but with the rotate tool we can click and drag to identify a rotation plane and then when i let this go i can choose the start point of my rotation and the end point again i'm looking for that magical from radius on edge that we've nicknamed the leaning ladder inference let's get rid of all this extra stuff we don't need this i'll just reverse this face now and up arrow i can go from the peak here make a copy 3x and what a beautiful pyramid with 8 length sides uh that's it i've nailed every single one and how to do it very uh succinctly and cleanly i'm sure you all understand and have no way to prove me wrong uh if you do i suppose you could leave a but there's no need because um i covered them uh again if you this video please uh hit the button down below and we making videos that you want to see so let us know if there's any other types of videos you want to see on the sketchup youtube channel that's it for me and uh take it easy [music]
