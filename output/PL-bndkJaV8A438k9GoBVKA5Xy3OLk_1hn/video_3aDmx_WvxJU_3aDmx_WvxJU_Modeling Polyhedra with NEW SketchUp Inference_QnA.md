##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- y'all my name is tyson and this time around let's build some [music] polyhedra polyhedra polyhedron um first thing off the bat i i'm probably going to get some of these terms right wrong so please uh forgive me or bear with me um what i think is going to be really interesting about this though is that we're going to try to build all of these forms using the native tools because it's going to be excellent practice in kind of some advanced rotate tool uh inference locking just modeling off the axis because of the the angles that we're going to have and and some techniques that we don't may not typically use so this is going to be a fun exercise let's jump into it all right um before we go uh start modeling i want to review um some concepts that are going to be really important to what we're doing the first is that the rotate tool many of you know that you can rotate and that it will align the surfaces or that you can hit the arrow keys say if i wanted to rotate this triangle i can hit the arrow key to uh set my rotation direction but another way you can do that is click and drag the mouse to create your own so if i wanted to rotate this about this edge or this edge i'm dragging the mouse as soon as i let go now i can pick a point and use the rotate tool normal so that's the first thing to uh know or be refreshed of is is using the rotate tool in that way clicking and dragging the other thing to know if i click here drag so i quickly establish that as my base i'm going to click here and it used to be in sketchup that there was no inference there was no way to say i want this point to meet this surface well now there is this inference point was introduced um in i believe the most recent version of sketchup so this may only be available in version 20124 but this opens up some interesting possibilities so for example if we rotate this again i'm going to click and drag to quickly establish that i could probably grab anywhere along this edge let's say here start to rotate this and indeed i can find where that point would intersect that said i think it's usually easier to grab uh an end point or corner of a group so that's what i'm going to be trying to do is to establish that um you know where that's going to meet up with the surface that's going to be key to how we're going to make this work so keep that in mind that that is fairly new to the rotate tool that new inference we're going to use that the other thing that i want to at least quickly cover is that there's um there's other videos there's other ways to model shapes this as uh often is the case there's multiple ways to approach something we're going to do something a little different today than what i've seen out there but just so you know we're going to use uh primarily native tools um to do the modeling but i did want to least uh show that for example a lot of polyhedra are based on you know as you get more and more complicated they're still based on um simpler versions so for example we're going to model this ios iosd do decahedron we're going to model this using native tools but you could also create the do decahedron and if i i come in here select these faces select all of these for example there is a plugin this plugin and it is called s su for you uh su two components one of these will turn each face into its own component uh or all of them into a component so if i do this click this button all of these faces have been turned into components and so for example i could offset one push it in a little bit make this very interesting let me undo the other thing that we could quickly do is draw lines and we're going to quickly get this form in fact if i use a uh a polygon i'm sorry a pentagon and just draw it really quickly and then erase those edges of that component i don't need you can see we're left all we'd have to do is trace over these and we'd have the i ooa hedron so um just to introduce that there are multiple ways to uh approach this and with that said let's jump in and we're going to build these uh we'll just sort of work our way down the doa the doa hedron is actually going to be really easy for us to do and here's how we're going to approach it let's use the polygon tool and we're going to draw uh any size uh pentagon and i'm going to quickly group this and then when we're creating this or when i'm looking at any of these really i don't understand how they're created i am fully reverse engineering what already exists out there and so in this case when i look at this one the doca hedron i can see that it's just this same sized um pentagon and that here they're rotated up to where this edge would meet exactly well that's perfect because using that new inference point that new uh way to rotate we can do that so i'm going to draw a reference surface so let me find this edge draw back and then i'll just select say this edge hold the shift key to lock and extend this out and let me just group this perfect let me rotate a copy of this now here's where um back here where i was talking about how it's easier to uh rotate this up by corners or known points i need to rotate this now to where it would meet with this surface so if i just try and do that um it i'm not grabbing a point that see how my cursor and my point's not the same so what will help us do this is i'm going to draw a simple line and i'll lock it and then draw it exactly to right so you see what we have here so i'm going to select this uh i keep getting my terms wrong this pentagon and rotate it but i'm going to start my rotation tool from this this point so i click drag to establish that baseline and then click on this point that will allow me i rotate around it should allow me to rotate that up till i see there it is from radius on face and group i'm going to carefully click and it has rotated that exactly to where it would meet up with the adjacent um the adjacent polygons and now i can simply just rotate copies of this four times erase these parts that i don't need i'll select it all invoke the flip tool let's just mirror this up and use the rotate tool we'll find the center of our there's so many references it's come on come on give me the give me the one we're asking for here there we go grab that corner move it to rotate to that corner and then just move these back into place and we can test if our geometry really does uh meet up together by simply ungrouping these and seeing if those edges weld now if we s this group it and run the solid inspector well it's telling us our faces are reversed but other than that nice everything is great so that is the key is this idea that we can rotate uh these surfaces up until they meet where you know an adjacent piece of geometry would be and we can create those surfaces to help us do that so with that in mind let's move to our next one here let me we just created that well throw it away even though we have it okay uh iosa hedron iosa hedron again i don't know entirely part of the fun of an exercise this is saying okay well based on how we created this one can we uh how how do we create this one well how do we rotate one of these triangles such that's i don't know what we can do um after some trial and error is that when we look at this we see again this is a pentagon with equilateral triangles and with if we know that um we can create this top shape so let's draw a pentagon group it and we're not going to draw tri you know this is not an equilateral triangle that's not what we need what we can do though is simply draw a line select that line rotate a copy of it just over here somewhere i'm going to double click which is going to select both of our edges and group that so that now we can draw another line and we're just going to extend this out because that's all we need this edge is the right length we just need to know where right there where it meets up and that will give us our equilateral triangle so we've got this group all right now same thing as before we can see that all these triangles meet up with each other we just need a some bit of geometry that's going to uh give us that so we need to rotate this and this one we might not need to uh create anything else so if i select it go to the rotate tool click and drag to or i could just hit an arrow key uh the the right arrow key grab my point move this till it basically goes to here now i i've seen this done where you essentially you also realize that you can just draw a vertical edge right we're doing the same thing but that's what we needed let's rotate this i'm going to tap the up arrow key to lock the blue direction and then rotate copies so that's part of it that's the top and or bottom but how do we get the other piece well let's let's uh try this i'm going to make a copy use the flip tool and then we need to rotate this and again i'm going to tap the up arrow key to lock it to the vertical direction i'm rotate this so it meets the midpoint so where does this right this triangle needs to be rotated so that it would meet exactly at this point well how do we know that well here's one way we could do it if i just draw a vertical line we know it needs to rotate until it meets that line because if we try and rotate it to that point it's not going to it's going to be problematic you know if i'm rotating a copy because it's not that point it's not that we don't know exactly where that is but let me just grab this move it down a little bit and then we're going to rotate again i'll just say tap the right arrow key click click and rotate invoke a copy that until it meets oh not the midpoint i happen to be there right there right now we can erase this and move this down careful perfect um and from here we could just draw in the rest of the lines or copy this around um right what's that four times if i ungroup this when we create these we create faces inside as well so we can delete those as we go but let me quickly rotate oops and i want to rotate that lock to the blue direction four copies group it use the uh solid inspector to fix that internal face and the reverse faces there we go that uh that is what we're going to do for the rest of these for these other two is essentially we're using the rotate um and also this ability to say where do we rotate you know one of these pieces down to um and we just draw geometry as needed to to find out all right how are we going to do this one we're going to start with the same as uh the others but this in this case we need a uh hexagon and a pentagon with the same edge and then we're going to rotate our hexagon uh up and that will give us the top and then we'll work our way from there so let's see start here i group this to start or make it a component by all means um i tend to to explode everything to create a solid object but that may not be where you're headed so obviously make that a component if you want now here we need um a six sided so we're going to change the sides to six this is not going to draw originally where we need it to um so what can we do about that well in this case it's pretty straightforward so i'm going to group that we're going to say let's measure one edge here and it measures 2 feet and some change because we're not worried about how big this is so let's just say that's 2 feet and resize that group and then we'll do the same here measure it with the tape measure tool measure one edge whatever it is we're going to type in 2 feet resize so that those two edges uh are exactly where we need to be and then from there we've done the rest of this um for so we're going to find that midpoint because we need to create a surface we may need to extend that surface so i'll grab that edge lock to this existing edge and just extend it out if you're not familiar with locking to existing geometry again one of the reasons why this is just good practice something to work on and again i want to rotate this point up by some point over here that we don't have well we kind of have it with our group but just in case i'm going to draw a line extend that out then select rotate from this point and this corner rotate it up till we find see that nice uh inference there awesome that's what we need rotate this five times okay so with that how are we going to do the rest of this when we look at a truncated icosahedron you have the top and bottom which is this sort of flower of a the of the uh pentagon and the hexagons that's on the top and bottom and then you have alternating pentagon hexagon uh hexagon pentagon so these alternating things well we just need to get one set of these and the rest will create themselves so let's start with this let's take our um geometry here and copy it uh or flip it upwards again this this others needs to be rotated so we're going to rotate this we need to find that center point and carefully rotate let's see am i rotating from here to here and i'm going to move this up a little bit higher than it should be but the first thing we can do and this is good practice for the rotate tool is we can see that we have this same pentagon and it needs to just match up here well once we match up these two sides this is going to be at the correct angle so that's all we need to do is just make a copy from here to here and then figure out how to rotate this so that it meets up with these other two sides well this is a sometimes this is just one of those things where we're just going to try a couple things until we get this to work the first thing i want to do is i'm rotating along this edge until this meets um this edge here and then i'm going to rotate and i want this to be on this surface so i'm going to press the down arrow key i'll click here and somewhere here if i turn x-ray mode on is this corner and i'm going to rotate it into place here so we've got one edge established and that just that means that with that edge we can rotate click drag along this edge to establish that as the base and then click here and rotate this down to this point so if you haven't you know done this sort of um i don't know what to call it other than convoluted rotating it sometimes just takes sort of you just need to align one side as a starting point and then keep going from there all right now let's do the same thing i'm going to grab one of these and i need to rotate this not entirely sure or i think let's try well where is this meet up that's not what we want and that's not going to be what we want what about this if none of these are working again a good place to start is just to say all right fine i just need some intersection here and that will that will uh be enough to start i'm not kiding oh we were doing okay up till now um let me make this oh come on see how i can just i can find something and that should give me a place to start and say okay i'll start with that this imaginary line and line this up with if i turn xray mode on right so now we've now we've made these a parallel now we can just grab one of these hold it down tap down and there i'm kind of just you know floundering around in real time and i hope that you see yeah i depending on the scenario i don't know immediately recall you know what's the best approach but you can get there eventually and this is another case where if we've set this up right we can just draw a vertical line and then rotate this basically from this point till it meets up that line there it is perfect erase that move move these down into place and we are in business now we can just fill in the rest right because now we can take these two rotate them um four times i believe and um let's just ungroup this and do one of these that should give us these ones and then we'll rotate those as well four times did it work i think it did looks pretty good let's group this run our um solid inspector reverse those faces all right i am running really long on this one but you know that i hope this is kind of the thing where it just gives you some ideas of a different way to approach this this last one we don't have to build it out we showed one way to approach it which is just start with a doca hedron how uh you could approach this um if you think of the type of thing we've been doing where we're rotating one surface till it meets another in this case it's not a surface but if you see this pentagon and this one these pentagons are rotated to where they'll meet at this point so instead of the oops five sides so if we had one and i quickly group that flip it and move it back into place instead of trying to meet up a surface with an edge we're rotating something this and how do we know where to meet we might need to draw a little bit bit of reference geometry but let's say we we know that it needs to rotate basically till it would meet up here um through the middle so if we draw a line and this way and build our surface select this select this edge move lock extend let's move this up a little bit group that one and then we need to move this up to where this point would meet it and so we're drawing is it here so we rotate click drag to establish that point from here rotating up till that point okay we we'll find it i don't know if it's giving us these points but i i want to see that uh there it is that that particular inference that should be oops the start we need and from here we could just um midpoint to sometimes there let's turn x-ray mode on and that should help us to find that right so there we go again and then we could fill those in fill those edges in and carry on so same idea just rotating about a point instead of about an edge nice okay uh i i have no idea um i probably went a little long on that one because it is a little bit of a fiddling but i hope it give you an idea of how you could approach something that might be how would i how would i do that and that new inference in particular that inference that allows you to rotate one point or a face and and and lock a point and meet another face or an edge that unlocks all of this um opportunity to to approach this in kind of a unique way um so try it try it if you haven't and i don't know go have some fun i thought this was i thought this was fun uh exploring this took me a while to figure out some of these um clearly made some mistakes or or you get geometry a little off that's just part of the that's part of the the process right let let me know what you think uh let us know if you have a different approach or different ideas or things that we should try or show or you know just any suggestions at all we we definitely want to hear uh what you'd us to cover uh as always if you haven't and and thanks you all we'll see you next time [music]
