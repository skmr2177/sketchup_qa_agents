##INPUT TRANSCRIPT

hey guys it's aaron welcome back to sketchup square one where we cover the basics of sketchup so this is a great spot to start if you're new to sketchup or if you're self-taught and maybe need a way to cover the official basics we're going to take a look today at one of my favorite tools which is the line tool let's hop right in okay so the line tool you get to align to a couple different ways the toolbar the default toolbar across the top does have it right here it's this little pencil icon it's also available in the large tool set which of course you can pull up by going to view tool palettes or on windows will be tool toolbars and turning on the large tool set it's right here again just the pencil icon so you can click on that and you'll get it in the default toolbar at the top you can see there's a little arrow next to if you click and hold on that you'll get the option to switch between line and freehand we'll come back to freehand in a minute right now i really want to just look at line there's also a shortcut key by default the shortcut key for the drawing align tool is the l key on your keyboard so if you're in a different command i want to real quickly switch to drawing lines you can just hit l alright so the line tool is very simple i'm going to click two points and it's going to draw a line between those two points very very easy so we're going to start with something it's a basic concept but something that you definitely want to get the the hang of and that is how to click your mouse i know this sounds silly but what i want to do is get in the habit of clicking your left mouse button and then releasing to pick a point so click and release as opposed to clicking and holding down the line and dragging it we're going to click release so right now as i move this around i'm not holding down a mouse button this is so much easier so so many times people get in trouble when they they try to drag and they accidentally release when they're not ready to this prevents you from accidentally drawing line where you don't want click and release and then move your mouse to the next point and click and release again all right so you can see this is the the basic functionality of line tool it's going to draw a line from that first point i picked to whatever the second point i pick is you can see the line following from that start point to my cursor which is currently a little pencil so one of the things you will see as i move around too see how that turned green there turn red here turn blue here what's happening is inferencing is showing me where i can trace or or stay parallel to the main axes of the model we're going to have a whole nother video on inferencing so i'm not going to dive too deep into this right now but know that that is a good thing it's supposed to be happening and it allows you to keep nice straight lines as dry your model without any modifier keys or anything like that all right so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just draw a line i'm just going to draw come over here you can see one of the things you i want you to keep an eye on is this lower right corner where it says length right now see as i put as i move my mouse around it's telling me exactly how long that is so one of the things that new users get caught up in is they try to draw exact dimensions using this and i will tell you right now that's gonna just it's just gonna cause pain heartache and pain what this does this so if i'm looking to just draw an arbitrary line because i wanna show you what the properties of a line are i can just come over here and click if i click right now it's gonna draw a line that is 11 foot three and three 8 inches so for this example that's fine i'll go back to the select command i'm going to pick it and if i look at entity info it tells me this is currently an edge edges are what we call single lines in sketchup so that is currently an edge there it is 11 foot 3 and 3 8 perfect that's what i wanted to do now let's say i want to come down the green line the green axis this way i'm going to click to this point you'll notice that if as i move my mouse close to that boom when i get on it it turns green and says endpoint if i click i don't have to click right on it so you can click a little bit away from it as long as that's green and says end point when i click it's going to start my next line at that point i'm going to come down the green axis and i want to come down exactly eight feet so i could do this game again where oh i'm going i can't get to exactly eight all i have to do is start in the direction i want to draw and then type in the direction the dimension i want to put in there don't come down and click in the length field you don't have to do that it already knows that if you type you're entering a length so i'm just move down the green axis and i'm going to type in eight foot see how it shows up down there in length and then enter now i've drawn an eight foot line along the green axis you'll notice too that after you draw a line you stay connected to the end of that line that happens automatically that's a freebie don't have to do anything to make it happen it just happens if you want to disconnect you can just hit the escape key and that will disconnect you from that point to reconnect again just get near it click on the green green end point there and i can start pulling across here so again inferencing we're not going to get too deep into this but one of the things that inferencing will let me do is draw a line along the red axis to that point on edge means i'm connecting to this point see that as i move on there right here i have a midpoint here i'm connecting to the line inferencing is great it's really easy to draw lines but the important part is that to draw a line i'm going to click release move my mouse click release or click release move my mouse into a direction and then type an exact dimension i did mention we'd look at the freehand command real quick so either in the large toolbar it's right here this little squiggle line or again you can click and hold down on the line tool and you can click the freehand tool there this operates a little differently and violates exactly the thing i was talking about because the way that the freehand tool works is you do have to click and hold down the mouse button and then you can just start drawing a squiggly line like this when you release it's going to turn it into a bunch of line segments so where i picked this this line before and we looked at the info and it told me it was an edge what happens if i click this one it tells me it's a curve it tells me how many segments it was made up of and what the exact length of those pieces was or the total line was or this shorter one right here that's going to tell me that's a 19 foot curve where this one is 101 feet so that is the basics of using the line tool like i said it's really hard to use the line tool too much without getting into inferencing but i don't want to jump in and bite off too much to begin with go ahead and use the line tool to draw some shapes it's a great way too to see how sketchup goes about creating surfaces and breaking lines and that sort of thing go in and start clicking around make some lines draw some lines don't be afraid to break anything if you're just messing around in a model you can always close it and start over right try it use it a little bit and we'll come back next time and we'll take a look at the next tool in sketchup square one hopefully like that if so click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of each and every one of them if you're a subscriber most importantly though please leave a comment down below this whole series is actually happening because of comments from viewers like you we like making these videos a lot we like it even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you you


#OUTPUT Q&A Pairs 

1. How do I access the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Steps:
Open SketchUp.


Locate the Line Tool:


On the default toolbar, look for the pencil icon.


Or go to View > Tool Palettes (Mac) or View > Toolbars (Windows), and enable Large Tool Set to access the pencil icon there.


Alternatively, press the L key on your keyboard to activate the Line Tool via shortcut.



2. How do I use the Line Tool to draw lines in SketchUp?
Steps:
Activate the Line Tool (via toolbar or by pressing L).


Click and release your left mouse button to mark the starting point.


Move your mouse to the desired end point (don‚Äôt hold the button).


Click and release again to complete the line.


Repeat the process to continue drawing connected lines.



3. What is the correct way to click when drawing lines?
Answer:
 Always click and release, instead of clicking and dragging.
 This prevents accidental misplacement and allows for cleaner, controlled line drawing.

4. How can I draw lines of exact length in SketchUp?
Steps:
Click to set your starting point.


Move your mouse in the direction you want the line to go.


Type the exact length (e.g., 8' for eight feet).


Press Enter ‚Äî the line will snap to that precise length.


‚úÖ You don't need to click into any field; just start typing after moving the mouse.

5. How does SketchUp help you align with axes while drawing?
Answer:
 SketchUp uses inferencing:
When your line is aligned with the Red, Green, or Blue axis, the line changes color (red, green, or blue).


You‚Äôll see tooltips like "On Green Axis" or "Endpoint" to help guide you.



6. How do I view the length of a line while drawing?
Answer:
 As you move your mouse after clicking the first point, the Length is shown in the bottom-right corner of the SketchUp window.

7. How can I end or break a connected line sequence?
Steps:
After drawing a line, the next one starts from the end of the previous line by default.


Press the Escape (Esc) key to stop the sequence and start fresh.



8. How can I draw a line from a specific endpoint or along an axis?
Steps:
Hover your mouse near an existing endpoint until it shows "Endpoint" in green.


Click to start the new line from there.


Move your mouse in the desired axis direction (e.g., green for Y).


Type in a length if needed and press Enter.



9. What is inferencing in SketchUp, and why is it helpful?
Answer:
 Inferencing is SketchUp‚Äôs way of helping you snap and align lines with:
Axes (red, green, blue)


Midpoints


Other geometry


It makes drawing accurate, connected shapes easier without additional tools.

10. What is the Freehand Tool, and how is it different from the Line Tool?
Steps:
Click and hold the Line Tool icon and select Freehand (squiggly line).


Or select it from the Large Tool Set.


Click and hold your mouse and draw a wavy line.


Release the mouse to complete it.


‚ö†Ô∏è Unlike the Line Tool, Freehand requires click-and-drag. It creates a curve made of small segments, not a straight edge.

11. How do I check the properties of a line in SketchUp?
Steps:
Switch to the Select Tool.


Click on a line.


Open the Entity Info panel:


It will tell you whether it‚Äôs an Edge or a Curve.


You'll also see the length and segment count (for curves).



12. How can I practice using the Line Tool in SketchUp?
Answer:
 Experiment by:
Drawing random shapes.


Connecting lines along axes.


Typing dimensions as you go.


Viewing entity properties.


Don't worry ‚Äî you can always start a new model!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i'm and today we're going to talk about hiding seams in geometry so i just used the term seam there's not really seam seams aren't a thing you know there's not an entity type called seams what i'm talking about is that line that can be in there between two surfaces that break them into two pieces sometime that's good because you want to put different materials on one section versus another something that but sometimes through the modeling process you end up with one chunk connected to another chunk and it should be smooth but you got a line between them we're going to talk about how to clean that up we're going to look at three different instances one with just raw geometry one with groups and then another with components because how you deal with them might be different uh and we're going to take a look at that right now all right first one's first sad captain obvious all right so the first thing we got here is this is just raw geometry so i just have these faces if you're ever doing this this makes sense so i got this little uh little little mockup i'm doing for a tiny home kind of thing here uh looking at some windows i could put in and i got my roof section which would be built separately from my walls so i modeled it that way but now when i look at it i want to see my siding go top to bottom and in this case when it's just raw jou this if these two pieces are in plain i can it's just as simple as deleting or erasing those pieces that done i mean it's it's pretty simple i'm going to undo real quick and and on one thing if i turn on on my x-ray so we're going to go up here to view edge style and turn on i'm sorry face style and hit x-ray see there's actually a face in here right there and then if i look up here same thing in between because the way i model this is separate pieces as soon as i get rid of one of these edges that face goes away see how that all disappeared same thing down here so that extra face right there get rid of that boom gone uh and with x-ray i actually come through here and get rid of those edges around the back too look at that that's that's efficient modeling right there that x-ray all right let's go ahead and turn we don't need that turn all right that looks pretty good so this is now one monolithic set of geometry right this is just one big hopefully solid piece if i ever wanted to 3d print or something i could do that with this uh but yeah so i got rid of those pieces pretty easy if they're in line if they're not in line if one piece is angled off the other there's a chance when you erase that line it'll break it and then you'll have a big hole on the side of the model that happens if everything's in line though this uh that should be good you should be good just erasing those let's talk about what happens when they groups right so this is how i would most likely model something this even in a conceptual situation i would separate the floor from the walls from the roof so in this case if i want a nice smooth say say there's just one piece of side i want to look just this top to bottom what i' have to do is go into this group and i want to go to view component edit and hide rest the model real quick so i just want to see this piece so what i could do is i could come in here and i could go to erase and i have my modifier keys down at the bottom and what i want to do is actually want to hide these i i want i want to i want to make sure they don't show up so i'm going to turn on hit shift hold down shift and hit all four edges here so if i go look at that right now you don't have that edge there anymore i just have the surface so when i come back out here i what they're still there no they're not still there they actually disappeared on this piece but they didn't disappear on this piece so if i grab this piece i want do the same thing again shift erase dr across each of these four sides and now when i come out look what happens oo nice and smooth let's do the same thing at the bottom because practice makes good at stuff i'm going to do the same thing i'm going to erase shift i just have to tap shift too since uh what 2020 or 2021 it's a toggle so you just tap shift once and that goes that uh and hide stays on then of course double click same thing here shift erase erase erase erase there we go so i got the same thing they are separate pieces still this can look kind of weird if i'm in here in walls and i'm messing around moning around with stuff and i see that this you know this line is missing it can it can be a little weird sometimes but uh again model for whatever you're actually planning to do so in this case if the thing that's important is this final look right here then it doesn't matter if it looks funny in here because i'm working on the model and i know it's supposed to be there so it's okay uh as long as it doesn't bother me as i'm modeling then having that hidden is going to be good because then i can just hop right back out here and everything look smooth all right so these were groups so each of these if i click in the point see group group group these were all just solid groups if i come over here i actually have a component so this is going to work a little bit different i said working with a group versus a component primarily because so i have you see this each corner of this table is a separate component if i double click into one of them even though i have hide rest of model turned on they stay here because this is not the rest of the model this is copies of the same instance i'm working on there's a separate hide for that so if i go back up into view component edit and turn on hide similar components then that goes away all right so a couple things i want to talk about about here so one thing what can happen in models this is even if i go through and i do the same thing shift erase erase i get rid of all these edges this what can happen sometimes is this face right here can bleed through so depending on how the shadows are hitting sometimes as i'm working around here i'll still i'll get a flicker right along the edge where those two pieces meet so what i would do in something this is probably hide this face as well and rather than using eraser i just did i'm going to undo a couple times and get all my edges back instead of using eraser i just did what i might do just to keep it simple is do a group select from the edge that see now i've got the face and all the edges that make up that face selected but i can't just hit eraser and hide it what i can do though is come over to entty info and just toggle the eyeball off and then it goes away so it looks this is a hole now it looks i got a big hole in here but it's not it's still there it's just hidden i do the same thing over here um i know you're saying oh aon you got it got this this cool uh 3d mouse so it's really easy to navigate to that side view it's pretty easy to just use orbit to slide over here too if you don't that if you don't getting into a spot where you can do a quick select that or if you have more complex geometry you can also double click double click selects the face and all the edges that create that face to highlight and then i come over here and toggle all off so again now it looks it looks i have a hole right looks this is a problem but this is still a solid piece they're just hidden geometry when i come out here and see how that ties together so even though i have four pieces they all look the same and because they're component i can do stuff uh grab grab this and maybe slide it over slide it up and again it's going to look uniform because as i'm moving that it's moving all four pieces because it is part of that component and even though it's a component i don't have to mess with i don't have to tolerate those edges if i was taking this out to rendering of course it wouldn't matter edges don't show up outside of sketchup but for the case of creating a drawing inside a sketchup hiding those edges those seams between geometry can be super helpful and super easy and the nice thing too is if i'm in here working and i want to select that edge or something that all i have to do i don't have to unhide anything all i have to do go up to view go up and turn on hidden geometry and those will show up as dotted lines and i could grab that move that edge around just i would any other geometry and then if i wanted to i leave it on too and i get my doted lines and i just toggle it off by going to hidden geometry i really i highly recommend putting a a shortcut key on hidden geometry it is one of the hidden geometry and the other thing we use here was uh hyd address a model i recommend shortcut keys bound to both these commands as you're modeling sketch up this going to take you a lot save you a lot of time make it real quick and easy to do that kind of modeling and editing so there you go quick and easy way to uh hide those seams between groups components i should say it the right way components groups and raw geometry this of course is not necessary you could actually go through your entire modeling career and sketch up for years and years and years and never hide any geometry and just have those lines show up if that's cool with you that's cool with me you do your thing that's perfectly fine i a lot of times to have my geometry cleaned up show smooth you know especially in in buildings buildings in particular because uh uh i come from residential architecture and the outside where i have my my roof maybe a gable is separate from the wall below because they're two different groups or two different components or whatever but i to have my siding just be nice and clean across there without having that line and this is how i'd go about that if you that video click down on if you haven't already please do we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you most importantly though leave us a down below let me know what you think of this tip if you use it if you use a variation of this there's a different way to do it or if you use it for a different kind of modeling or failing that you don't do this do you have another tip that you think would make a good video let us know in the comments down below we making these videos a lot but we them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you n
