# People  What's the right level of detail and style - Q&A

Q1. What are the factors to consider when adding people to a SketchUp model?
A1. The main factors to consider when adding people to a SketchUp model are the type of person (standing, sitting, doing an activity), the level of detail (2D or 3D), and the style (clothing, color, engagement with the space).

Q2. Where can you find people models to add to your SketchUp model?
A2. The 3D Warehouse is the easiest place to find people models to add to your SketchUp model. You can search for terms like "people," "face me," "photo," or "3D" to find different types of people models.

Q3. What is the default scale figure in SketchUp, and is it commonly used in final models?
A3. When you start a new SketchUp model, there is a default scale figure. However, most people don't use the scale figure in their actual drawings, as it's just a placeholder.

Q4. What are the different types of people models available in the 3D Warehouse?
A4. The different types of people models available in the 3D Warehouse include photographs, silhouettes, face me components, and fully-fledged 3D models.

Q5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a 2D face me component for people in your model?
A5. The advantage of using a 2D face me component is that it's simple and easy to add. The disadvantage is that it will always face the camera, regardless of the viewing angle, which can look unnatural.

Q6. How can you customize the appearance of a 2D face me component?
A6. You can customize the appearance of a 2D face me component by exploding it, making it unique, and then applying a new color or adjusting the opacity to create a desired style or level of detail.

Q7. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a photograph for people in your model?
A7. The advantage of using a photograph is that it looks more realistic. The disadvantage is that it may have too much detail for a conceptual model, and the level of detail may not match the rest of the model.

Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a 3D model for people in your model?
A8. The advantages of using a 3D model are that it can be viewed from any angle, and it can cast realistic shadows and interact with lighting in a rendering. The disadvantage is that it may have too many polygons or an unsuitable style for your model.

Q9. How can you customize the appearance of a 3D people model?
A9. You can customize the appearance of a 3D people model by exploding it, making it unique, and then applying a new color or material to the geometry.

Q10. Why might you want to add people to your SketchUp model?
A10. Adding people to your SketchUp model can provide a sense of scale, show how people might use or interact with the space, and help viewers envision themselves in the model.

Q11. How can you adjust the level of detail of a people model to match your SketchUp model?
A11. You can adjust the level of detail of a people model by choosing between 2D or 3D models, and by customizing the appearance through techniques like applying new colors or adjusting opacity.

Q12. What is the purpose of using silhouettes for people models in SketchUp?
A12. Silhouettes can be used for people models in SketchUp when you want a simplified representation without too much detail, but still want to show the outline or shape of a person.

Q13. How can you ensure that a 3D people model engages with the space in your SketchUp model?
A13. To ensure that a 3D people model engages with the space in your SketchUp model, you can customize its pose or orientation to face specific elements or furniture in the scene, rather than always facing the camera.

Q14. What is the advantage of using a 3D people model over a 2D model when it comes to rendering?
A14. The advantage of using a 3D people model over a 2D model when it comes to rendering is that the 3D model can cast realistic shadows and interact with lighting in a more natural way, providing a more realistic result.

Q15. How can you find people models with specific activities or poses in the 3D Warehouse?
A15. To find people models with specific activities or poses in the 3D Warehouse, you can try including additional keywords in your search, such as the activity or pose you're looking for (e.g., "people walking," "people sitting").

Q16. What is the purpose of using a neutral color or style for people models in your SketchUp model?
A16. Using a neutral color or style for people models in your SketchUp model can help prevent them from becoming too distracting or drawing too much attention away from the main focus of the model, which is typically the space or architecture.

Q17. How can you ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are appropriate for the context or purpose of the model?
A17. To ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are appropriate for the context or purpose of the model, you should consider factors like their clothing, activities, and how they engage with the space. For example, if it's an office model, you might want people in business attire engaged in work activities.

Q18. What is the advantage of using multiple types of people models (e.g., 2D and 3D) in the same SketchUp model?
A18. Using multiple types of people models (e.g., 2D and 3D) in the same SketchUp model can provide variety and allow you to choose the most appropriate representation for different areas or purposes within the model.

Q19. How can you adjust the polygon count of a 3D people model to ensure it doesn't slow down your SketchUp model's performance?
A19. To adjust the polygon count of a 3D people model and ensure it doesn't slow down your SketchUp model's performance, you can look for models with a lower polygon count or simplify the geometry of the model by reducing the number of faces or edges.

Q20. What is the purpose of using a group of people models in your SketchUp model, rather than individual models?
A20. Using a group of people models in your SketchUp model, rather than individual models, can help create a more realistic and lively scene, showing how multiple people might interact or use the space together.

Q21. How can you ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are appropriately scaled and proportioned?
A21. To ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are appropriately scaled and proportioned, you can compare them to the default scale figure or other known dimensions in your model, and adjust their size accordingly.

Q22. What is the advantage of using a 3D people model that can be viewed from any angle, compared to a 2D model?
A22. The advantage of using a 3D people model that can be viewed from any angle, compared to a 2D model, is that it looks more natural and realistic when viewed from different perspectives, as it doesn't always face the camera.

Q23. How can you use people models to create a sense of activity or movement in your SketchUp model?
A23. To create a sense of activity or movement in your SketchUp model using people models, you can choose models that depict people in various poses or activities, such as walking, sitting, or engaging with objects in the space.

Q24. What is the purpose of using a combination of different people models (e.g., standing, sitting, doing activities) in your SketchUp model?
A24. Using a combination of different people models (e.g., standing, sitting, doing activities) in your SketchUp model can help create a more dynamic and realistic representation of how people might use or interact with the space in different ways.

Q25. How can you ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are consistent with the overall style or theme of the model?
A25. To ensure that the people models you add to your SketchUp model are consistent with the overall style or theme of the model, you can choose models with appropriate clothing, colors, and styles that match the desired aesthetic or context of the model.
