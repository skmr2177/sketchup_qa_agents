# AI Helps Me Design A Building   Iterative 3D Model - Q&A

Here is a comprehensive Q&A covering all the content from the tutorial:

Q1. What was the goal of this SketchUp Live session?
A1. The goal was to use AI (specifically SketchUp's Diffusion extension) to design the exterior of a residential home from scratch, with no predetermined plans or requirements. The AI would generate ideas for the massing, style, features, and finishes which would then be modeled in SketchUp.

Q2. How did the process start?
A2. It started with a blank SketchUp scene representing an empty plot of land. The first prompt given to Diffusion was to generate ideas for a "mid-century modern ranch style family home of 3,000 square feet". This gave some initial massing and style options to work from.

Q3. What SketchUp extension was used for the AI-generated designs?
A3. The SketchUp Diffusion extension was used, which leverages the stable diffusion AI engine to generate 3D model geometry and imagery based on text prompts combined with existing SketchUp model geometry.

Q4. How were prompts submitted to the AI?
A4. Prompts were typed into the forums.sketchup.com forum topic for this live stream, allowing the audience to contribute prompt ideas. The prompts were then copy/pasted into the Diffusion extension by the streamer.

Q5. What was the initial prompt given to the AI?
A5. The initial prompt was: "mid-century modern ranch style family home of 3,000 square feet"

Q6. How did the AI's outputs influence the SketchUp modeling?
A6. The geometry and imagery generated by the AI prompts were used as starting points and inspiration for modeling the actual SketchUp geometry. Promising features from the AI outputs were modeled manually in SketchUp.

Q7. What was done after getting the initial massing from the AI?
A7. The initial AI-generated massing was imported into SketchUp as a starting point. Basic roof and wall geometry was modeled based on that massing to establish the overall house shape and size.

Q8. How were windows and doors added initially?
A8. The next AI prompt asked for things like "deep set front door in the middle" and "windows around the front". The resulting imagery was used as a guide for modeling windows, doors, and an entry area in SketchUp.

Q9. How was the garage area determined?
A9. One of the AI outputs showed a hint of a garage door on the left side. This was used as inspiration for modeling out a garage area on the left side of the house.

Q10. How was the backside/patio area of the house designed?
A10. An AI prompt was used asking for a "backside of modern house with sliding glass door, large patio, multiple smaller windows". The outputs showed different patio/window layouts which were then modeled in SketchUp.

Q11. What was done to add a chimney to the design?
A11. A prompt was used asking for a "modern looking chimney". When this didn't give good results, a chimney was manually modeled and added to the roof based on the existing geometry.

Q12. How were the final exterior material finishes determined?
A12. For the final renders, a prompt was used asking for "wood and dark gray finish, stone chimney" along with mentioning windows reflecting sunlight. The AI's interpretation of these materials was used for the final SketchUp renders.

Q13. What settings were used in the Diffusion extension?
A13. The "Respect Geometry" setting was used at different levels - higher levels to conform to the existing SketchUp geometry more closely, and lower levels to allow more creative interpretation by the AI. The "Prompt Influence" was also adjusted between prompts.

Q14. How long did the entire design process take?
A14. The entire live design session using SketchUp and the Diffusion extension took around 1.5 hours from start to the final rendered exterior design.

Q15. What is 3D Basecamp and when/where will it be held?
A15. 3D Basecamp is SketchUp's annual user conference. The 2023 event will be held in November in Las Vegas at the Sands Expo & Convention Center. Over 100 classes and training sessions will be offered.
