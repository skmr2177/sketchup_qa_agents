# How I Go from SketchUp to Digital Sketch (Photoshop, Wacom Cintiq)

### 1. Why does Eric recommend pulling back on detail even when you can model it easily?
**Answer:**
Eric explains that modeling "just enough information to give you a base layer to sketch over the top" is actually beneficial, especially in early project phases. He notes that sometimes you want to pull back on detail "even if you have it already modeled or even if you can model it fairly easily" because it allows for more creative expression and faster iteration. This approach gives you a foundation to build upon while leaving room for hand-drawn elements that might be faster to create than detailed 3D modeling.

### 2. What specific elements did Eric choose not to model in his courtyard example?
**Answer:**
Eric deliberately left out plants and vegetation from his 3D model for two reasons: it would take too long to model, and "sometimes stuff from 3D Warehouse can be really high poly." He explains that he prefers to draw plants anyway, as they're often easier to sketch quickly than to model in detail. He also mentions that people could be turned on and off depending on whether he wants to draw his own people, though in this case the existing people were basic enough to draw over.

### 3. What are the three exports Eric creates from SketchUp for his sketching workflow?
**Answer:**
Eric creates three separate exports: 1) **SketchUp lines** - using hidden line style with no sky for clean black and white lines, 2) **SketchUp shadows** - with profiles and edges turned off, shadows enabled, and adjusted lighting to avoid too-dark foreground, and 3) **Color by tag** - with shadows off, face style set to shaded with textures, and color by tag enabled with darkness at 90 and lightness at 0 for uniform colors. Each export serves a specific purpose in the Photoshop workflow.

### 4. How does Eric set up the hidden line export for sketching?
**Answer:**
Eric goes to View → Face Style → Hidden Line, which "knocks out the color" to create an almost pencil sketch-like appearance. He also turns off the sky to get a plain white background. This creates a clean base layer that he can draw over in Photoshop. He exports this as a 2D graphic using his view size (1920 by 936) and names it "SketchUp lines" to distinguish it from his hand-drawn lines.

### 5. How does Eric prepare the shadow export and why does he adjust the lighting?
**Answer:**
Eric turns off profiles and edges so everything disappears, then enables shadows. He darkens the shadows to a point where they can be selected in Photoshop, but not too light. He adjusts the time of day to push shadows earlier in the morning so more of the courtyard is in sun, avoiding a too-dark foreground. He exports this as "Su shadows" and notes that he can always adjust the color later in Photoshop.

### 6. What is the purpose of the color by tag export and how does Eric set it up?
**Answer:**
The color by tag export creates a "material ID export" similar to what you'd use in rendering. Eric turns off shadows, sets face style to shaded with textures, enables color by tag, and pushes the darkness slider to 90 and lightness to 0. This gives him "true and uniform color" with no shading, allowing him to quickly select areas by color in Photoshop. For example, he can select everything that's cyan-colored (glass) to mask or work with specific materials.

### 7. How does Eric organize his Photoshop layers for the sketching workflow?
**Answer:**
Eric keeps his file simple with just a few layers: the three SketchUp exports (lines, shadows, color by tag) plus two new layers for his hand-drawn work - "Sketch color" and "Sketch lines." He renames the imported layers to match their purpose and adjusts the opacity of the SketchUp lines to around 35% to use them as reference. The color by tag layer remains frozen for quick selections, while the shadow layer gets recolored to purple (or any color of choice) for more visual pop.

### 8. What drawing tools does Eric use and how does he work with them?
**Answer:**
Eric uses a Wacom Cintiq tablet with a pen for drawing, but notes that the process works just as well with an iPad and Apple Pencil. He mentions that you can send files from desktop to iPad and use apps like Procreate, Photoshop, or Morpholio Trace. He emphasizes that the tool choice is personal - "the tool is yours" - but the process remains the same regardless of the drawing device used.

### 9. What types of elements does Eric prefer to draw rather than model?
**Answer:**
Eric draws vegetation like climbing vines, hanging plants, and ferns because they're "really difficult to get perfect" and can be "really high poly" from 3D Warehouse. He also draws hanging fans, fixtures, signage, and other details that "from a design standpoint maybe doesn't need to be modeled but maybe could be just brought in fairly quickly with some squiggled lines." He draws these elements "really quick with just a loose little textural thing" rather than spending time on precise 3D modeling.

### 10. How does Eric use the hybrid approach of combining SketchUp and hand-drawn elements?
**Answer:**
Eric uses a "hybrid approach" where he only draws elements that he wants to draw attention to or that would take too long to model. He can use layer masks to show or hide parts of the SketchUp model, allowing him to pick and choose what to show from his hand drawing versus the 3D model. For example, he might mask out windows to let the SketchUp model show through, or draw over areas where he wants to focus attention. This approach gives him the best of both worlds - the precision of 3D modeling and the speed and expressiveness of hand drawing.
