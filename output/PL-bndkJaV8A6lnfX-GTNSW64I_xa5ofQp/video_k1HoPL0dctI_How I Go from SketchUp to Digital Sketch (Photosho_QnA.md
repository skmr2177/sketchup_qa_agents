# How I Go from SketchUp to Digital Sketch (Photosho - Q&A

Q1. What is the purpose of this tutorial?
A1. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to go from a SketchUp model to creating a digital sketch in Photoshop, using a Wacom Cintiq tablet.

Q2. Why would you want to pull back on the level of detail in a SketchUp model?
A2. There are a few reasons to pull back on the level of detail in a SketchUp model, even if you have already modeled or can model the details easily:
- In the early concept phases of a project, it's useful to model just enough information to give you a base layer to sketch over the top of.
- Some details like plants, people, and other elements can be easier and faster to draw by hand rather than model in 3D.
- High poly 3D models from sources like the 3D Warehouse can be inefficient for early concept sketching.

Q3. What is the first step in preparing the SketchUp model for export?
A3. The first step is to go to View > Face Style > Hidden Line to remove colors and show just black and white lines, creating a pencil sketch-like base.

Q4. How do you remove the sky background from the SketchUp model?
A4. To remove the sky background and have a plain white background, you need to turn off the sky component in the SketchUp model.

Q5. What are the three exports taken from SketchUp?
A5. The three exports taken from SketchUp are:
1) SketchUp lines (hidden line view)
2) SketchUp shadows
3) SketchUp color by tag

Q6. How are the shadows exported from SketchUp?
A6. To export the shadows, first turn off the profile and edge lines, then turn on shadows. Adjust the shadow settings like darkness, time of day, etc. to get the desired shadow look before exporting.

Q7. What is the purpose of the "color by tag" export?
A7. The "color by tag" export assigns uniform colors to different tagged components in the model. This allows for quick selection of certain areas or materials when drawing over the export in Photoshop.

Q8. How are the SketchUp exports brought into Photoshop?
A8. The SketchUp exports are dragged and dropped from the file location into separate Photoshop layers, maintaining their relative scale and proportions.

Q9. What is done to the shadow layer in Photoshop?
A9. In Photoshop, the shadow layer is edited by selecting the gray shadow color range, creating a new layer, and changing the shadow color to something more vibrant like purple or blue.

Q10. What are the two new layers created in Photoshop for sketching?
A10. The two new layers created in Photoshop for sketching are:
1) Sketch Color layer
2) Sketch Lines layer  

Q11. What tool is used for the digital sketching process?
A11. A Wacom Cintiq tablet and pen display is used for the digital sketching process shown in the tutorial.

Q12. What kinds of details are recommended to draw rather than model in SketchUp?
A12. Details like vegetation (vines, ferns, palms, flowers), signage, hanging fixtures, and people are recommended to draw by hand rather than meticulously model in SketchUp.

Q13. How can you combine the SketchUp model lines with the hand-drawn sketches?
A13. You can use layer masks in Photoshop to mask out certain parts of the SketchUp model lines, allowing you to pick and choose which parts show through behind your hand-drawn sketches.

Q14. How is color added to the sketch?
A14. Color is added to the sketch by selecting areas based on the "color by tag" export layer, and then using the Sketch Color layer to fill in those selections with color washes or brushes.

Q15. What are some benefits of this SketchUp to digital sketch workflow?
A15. Some benefits include:
- Faster way to add detail without complex 3D modeling
- Ability to combine precise SketchUp lines with loose sketchy elements
- More creative expression and freedom in the sketching process
- Flexibility to choose what shows through from the SketchUp model

Q16. What software is required for this workflow?
A16. The main software required is SketchUp for creating the 3D model, and Photoshop for importing the SketchUp exports and doing the digital sketching.

Q17. Is a tablet necessary for this digital sketching process?
A17. While a pen tablet like the Wacom Cintiq is used in the tutorial, it is mentioned that you could potentially do a similar process using an iPad and Apple Pencil instead of the Cintiq.

Q18. What other apps or software are mentioned for digital sketching?
A18. Other apps mentioned for digital sketching include Procreate, Morpholio Trace, and potentially Adobe Illustrator.

Q19. How can you adjust the visibility of the SketchUp lines in the final sketch?
A19. In the final sketch shown, the visibility of the faded SketchUp lines can be adjusted by either pushing them forward to be darker, or pulling them back to be more subtle background lines.

Q20. What are some tips given for learning this sketching process?
A20. The main tip given is to not be afraid to just jump in and play around with sketching over your SketchUp models. Experimenting and having fun with the process is how the tutorial instructor learned these techniques.

Q21. What is the instructor asking for feedback on in the comments?
A21. The instructor asks viewers to provide feedback in the comments about whether they already sketch, what apps or software they use for digital sketching, and to share their own processes to learn from.

Q22. How can this workflow be useful for early design concepts?
A22. This SketchUp to digital sketch workflow can be particularly useful for early design concepts because it allows you to quickly add detail, vegetation, people etc. through sketching over a base SketchUp model, without needing to model every element in 3D.

Q23. What is the benefit of using the "color by tag" export?
A23. The benefit of using the "color by tag" export is that it allows you to quickly select and manipulate certain areas or materials in Photoshop based on the assigned colors, making it easier to add details or color to specific parts of the model.

Q24. How does this process compare to fully modeling every detail in SketchUp?
A24. This sketching process is presented as an alternative to fully modeling every single detail in SketchUp, which can be very time-consuming, especially in early concept phases. Sketching allows for faster addition of detail.

Q25. What role does the SketchUp model play in this workflow?
A25. The SketchUp model serves as the base layer or underlay that provides the core lines, shadows, and color coding that the sketching is built upon in Photoshop. It doesn't need to have every single detail modeled.

I've covered all the key points, tools, techniques, and workflows mentioned in depth through these 25 questions and answers. Please let me know if any other aspects need more comprehensive explanations.
