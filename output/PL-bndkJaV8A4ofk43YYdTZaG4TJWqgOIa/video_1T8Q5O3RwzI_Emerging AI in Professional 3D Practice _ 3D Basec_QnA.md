# Emerging AI in Professional 3D Practice   3D Basec - Q&A

Here is a comprehensive Q&A covering all the content from the tutorial:

Q1. What is the AI research and development mandate at Confluence?
A1. Confluence has given Daniel Tal and Jen Becker an R&D mandate to research and integrate AI tools into their workflows. This involves attending conferences, testing new AI models, putting out a bi-weekly AI newsletter to leadership, and finding ways to seamlessly incorporate AI in an affordable and invisible manner.

Q2. What are the different types of AI discussed and how are they used?
A2. The three main types discussed are:
1) Chat bots (like Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude) used for research, writing, scripting
2) Generative AI models (like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) used for creating concept imagery
3) Passive AI tools integrated into software like rendering engines, drone mapping, geodata processing

Q3. What are some key generative AI tools covered and their use cases?
A3. Midjourney is used extensively for creating inspirational imagery and visualizations. Stable Diffusion in SketchUp is demonstrated for generating photorealistic renders respecting model geometry. Ideogram excels at branding/text. Runway is shown for generating animations from stills. NVIDIA Canvas allows painting AI landscapes.

Q4. How is ChatGPT/Perplexity utilized in their workflows?
A4. ChatGPT and Perplexity are used for research, writing prompts for generative AI, scripting narrations, outlines and memos. The ability to have natural conversations and get summarized, well-sourced information is highlighted as a key benefit.

Q5. What is the role of custom AI bots/models?
A5. They demonstrate creating a custom QA/QC bot trained on their construction documents to automate reviews. The potential to create custom generative image models trained only on their project work is also discussed, via tools like NVIDIA Edify.

Q6. What are some passive AI tools integrated into their software?
A6. Lumion's AI denoising and raytracing capabilities are lauded for photorealistic renders. D5's AI upscaling of textures and HDRI maps is shown. Topaz AI is used for upscaling render resolutions and video framerates. Luma AI is used for 3D scanning objects via smartphone.

Q7. How are drones and geodata utilized, and what roles do they play?
A7. Drones are highlighted as being AI-driven for mapping, photogrammetry and 3D scanning. High-res geodata from providers like Nearmap and Ecopia are used as basemaps and to automatically generate 3D city models. SketchUp's Scan Essentials imports drone pointclouds.

Q8. What is the role of parametric modeling tools and how may they integrate with AI?
A8. Parametric urban design tools like UrbanPaint are precise where generative AI lacks accuracy. The future is seen as combining parametrics with AI guidance for best of both worlds. Tools like Rhino/Grasshopper's AI construction document processing are mentioned.

Q9. What lighting design tools are covered?
A9. LightUp for SketchUp is presented as a parametric lighting design tool that accurately renders IES profiles and produces lighting analysis visualizations, filling a gap left by rendering engines.

Q10. What are some of the AI trends and future applications discussed?
A10. Digital twins/simulations powered by AI like NVIDIA Omniverse are highlighted. Automated generation of 3D city models from aerial imagery is predicted. The need for AI governance/compliance frameworks like AI SOC 2 is mentioned.

Q11. How are AI tools evaluated and what challenges exist?
A11. An internal survey showed a statistical tie in rendering quality across engines, highlighting subjectivity. Overpromising/underdelivering is cited as a challenge, with a need to thoroughly evaluate tools. The fast pace of change requires constant research.

Q12. What is the role of leadership in adopting AI workflows?
A12. Leadership from executives like Chris DeLava and John Jacobson in advocating and funding the AI R&D mandate is stated as critical to making it possible. Having an AI-focused innovation culture is emphasized.

Q13. What is the importance of having a multidisciplinary team approach to AI integration?
A13. The presentation highlights that no single person could comprehensively adopt AI alone. It requires a team with diverse skills collaborating on research, testing, training and workflow integration of various AI tools.

Q14. How are AI tools integrated into the overall design visualization workflow?
A14. A piecemeal approach is shown, using different AI tools at various stages - geodata processing, 3D modeling, drafting, rendering, animation, video editing. The goal is to make AI invisible and seamless in their pipeline.

Q15. What are some of the specific tools and extensions for SketchUp mentioned?
A15. SketchUp extensions like Scan Essentials, PlaceMaker, UrbanPaint, Instant Architecture, SketchUp Diffusion and LightUp are covered in detail for their AI/parametric capabilities.
