# SketchUp for Event Design   3D Basecamp 2024 - Q&A

Q1. What was the purpose of this SketchUp project for the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium?
A1. The purpose was to create a 3D model of the various event spaces within Arrowhead Stadium, including ballrooms, clubs, and the field itself. This allowed event planners to visualize how different setups would look and make adjustments before the actual event, rather than relying solely on 2D CAD drawings.

Q2. Why did the Chiefs decide to have Trinity Animation create the 3D models instead of doing it themselves?
A2. Initially, the Chiefs got copies of SketchUp and received training from Trinity Animation. However, modeling the curved spaces of the stadium proved to be a challenging 3D modeling task. After some discussion, the Chiefs decided to have Trinity measure, photograph, build texture maps, and create all the 3D geometry as a turnkey solution.

Q3. What challenges did Trinity Animation face in modeling Arrowhead Stadium?
A3. The main challenge was that the stadium is built on a gradual curve, with the curve changing about every 10-15 feet by 2 degrees. This made it difficult to simply copy and array elements like columns. Additionally, features like the outward-slanted windows added complexity to the modeling process.

Q4. What techniques did Trinity use to accurately capture the dimensions and details of the event spaces?
A4. Trinity used a combination of techniques, including a camera to capture photos for textures, a measuring tape, a laser measure for high ceilings and varying depths, and a tablet to annotate photos with dimensions on-site.

Q5. How did Trinity create seamless, tilable textures for surfaces like carpets and woods?
A5. Trinity photographed the surfaces from a straight-down angle without perspective distortion. They then used photo editing tools like the Offset filter and Healing Brush in Photoshop to remove seams and create a tilable texture that could repeat seamlessly.

Q6. What was the purpose of creating a component library of furniture and other event elements?
A6. Trinity created a component library of furniture, chairs, lecterns, and other event elements from the Chiefs' inventory. This allowed the event planners at Arrowhead to easily drag and drop these components into the 3D scenes to set up different event configurations.

Q7. How did the 3D visualization solution benefit the event planners at Arrowhead Stadium?
A7. The 3D visualization solution allowed event planners to demonstrate to clients exactly how an event would look from any seat in the venue. They could adjust layouts, avoid obstructed views, and ensure proper clearance from columns before the event day. It also provided a better representation than the previously used 2D CAD drawings.

Q8. What was the significance of the "red boxes" included in the 3D scenes?
A8. The red boxes represented "no-go zones" around the columns in the event spaces. This helped the event planners ensure that furniture and other elements were kept at a safe distance from the columns, avoiding obstructed views.

Q9. How did Trinity ensure that the 3D scenes could run smoothly on older laptops used by event planners?
A9. Trinity kept the 3D models relatively low-poly and used optimized texture resolutions to ensure the scenes could run well on laptops without powerful graphics cards or processors.

Q10. What was the trivia question asked at the end of the presentation, and what was the prize?
A10. The trivia question was related to the content of the presentation. The prize for answering correctly was a Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl hat.
