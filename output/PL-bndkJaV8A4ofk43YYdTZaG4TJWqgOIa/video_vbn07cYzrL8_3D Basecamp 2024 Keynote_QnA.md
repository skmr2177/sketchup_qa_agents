# 3D Basecamp 2024 Keynote - Q&A

Q1. What is the goal of the SketchUp team?
A1. The SketchUp team's goal has always been to make software that reflects the way you think, the way you create, the way you work. Software that's a joy to use, that allows you to get the vision out of your head, and into a digital form as quickly as possible.

Q2. What is the vision for the SketchUp ecosystem?
A2. The vision for the SketchUp ecosystem is to bring interoperability, reality capture, collaboration, photorealism, and AI to the platform. This vision is shaped by user guidance and feedback.

Q3. What is the 3D Basecamp Partner Showcase?
A3. The 3D Basecamp Partner Showcase is a new session where top-tier technology partners showcase how they are participating in the SketchUp ecosystem. It also includes the first-ever 0-60 SketchUp startup competition where nine startups present new SketchUp integrations.

Q4. What is the significance of the design phase in a construction project?
A4. The decisions made in the earliest design phases have the most impact on cost and building efficiency. However, most of the design effort is spent later when it's harder to impact building cost and efficiency, and more expensive to make changes.

Q5. How is SketchUp helping to make complex spatial decisions more efficiently?
A5. SketchUp is integrating with other Trimble technology to create tools like Scan Essentials for importing site data, improving terrain data imports, and introducing features like Parametric Live Components to reduce the time it takes to build detailed models.

Q6. What are the two multi-year projects SketchUp has been working on?
A6. The two multi-year projects are: 1) Rebuilding the SketchUp graphics engine to improve performance and enable new visualization capabilities, and 2) Building a real-time collaboration engine.

Q7. What is the new SketchUp graphics engine capable of?
A7. The new SketchUp graphics engine enables features like ambient occlusion, which adds depth and richness to models and drawings. It also supports physically-based materials and image-based lighting for photorealistic rendering.

Q8. How does the new collaboration engine work?
A8. The new collaboration engine allows users to create shareable links that open in a web browser, leave comments directly in the model, and see changes made by others in real-time across Desktop, Web, and iPad.

Q9. What is SketchUp Diffusion?
A9. SketchUp Diffusion is an AI-powered tool that allows users to rapidly generate inspiration, explore design concepts, create compelling imagery, secure client buy-in faster, and increase win rates.

Q10. What improvements have been made to SketchUp Diffusion?
A10. Improvements to SketchUp Diffusion include better respecting the color and material choices made in SketchUp, introducing a gallery for reviewing past revisions, adding tools like Eraser and Sketch for editing generated images, and improving the overall quality and accuracy of the generated images.

Q11. What is SketchUp Assistant?
A11. SketchUp Assistant is a conversational AI interface that includes a collection of AI agents capable of handling a wide range of tasks, such as providing help and guidance, creating space layouts, finding 3D Warehouse content, automating tasks with Ruby scripts, and working together to complete complex workflows.

Q12. How can users train their own SketchUp Assistant?
A12. SketchUp is developing ways for users to train their own team of assistants using their data, patterns, and rubrics. This includes an assistant builder that allows users to upload information like building codes, zoning requirements, and design constraints.
