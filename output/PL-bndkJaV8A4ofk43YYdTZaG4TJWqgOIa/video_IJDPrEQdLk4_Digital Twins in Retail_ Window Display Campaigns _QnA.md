• **iPad apps** - For laser scanning and floor plan creation
• **Measuring tools** - For accurate physical measurements
• **360 photos and point clouds** - For capturing store environments
• **Layout** - For creating installation and production documents

7. How does the workflow handle data collection and model creation?
**Answer:**
Data is collected using:
• **Measuring tape** - For precise window and fixture dimensions
• **iPad or laser scanner** - For point cloud scans of store interiors and exteriors
• **360 photos** - For visual reference and team communication
The data is assembled into a SketchUp model, with components and tags for each store and campaign element.

8. How are digital twins used for creative, production, and installation teams?
**Answer:**
• **Creative team** - Uses the digital twin to visualize and iterate on campaign concepts
• **Production team** - Receives detailed layout files with dimensions, materials, and artwork for manufacturing
• **Installation team** - Gets installation guides, templates, and scene views for accurate setup in each store
Each team receives tailored outputs from the same central model, ensuring alignment and efficiency.

9. How does the workflow support multi-store and global campaigns?
**Answer:**
By creating a digital twin for each store, campaigns can be designed once and applied to many locations. Components and tags allow for easy updates and customization. Cloud sharing enables global teams to collaborate, review, and approve campaigns without travel, ensuring consistent brand execution worldwide.

10. What are the advantages of using components and tags in SketchUp for retail campaigns?
**Answer:**
• **Reusability** - Components can be updated across all stores simultaneously
• **Organization** - Tags separate store elements from campaign elements for easy visibility control
• **Efficiency** - Rapidly switch between stores, campaigns, and installation views
• **Customization** - Unique components for stores with different requirements
• **Scene management** - Save specific views for creative, production, and installation outputs

11. How does the workflow integrate with AR, VR, and AI technologies?
**Answer:**
Digital twins can be exported to AR/VR platforms for immersive review and training. AI tools can generate campaign assets, analyze customer flow, and personalize experiences. The workflow supports future-proofing by enabling integration with emerging technologies for advanced retail experiences.

12. What is the process for creating and managing campaign assets in the digital twin?
**Answer:**
• **Design assets** - Logos, color palettes, campaign graphics created in Affinity/Adobe or AI tools
• **Import to SketchUp** - Assets applied as textures or components in the 3D model
• **Component management** - Campaign elements (e.g., banners, plinths, vinyls) organized for reuse
• **Scene setup** - Save views for each store and campaign
• **Layout output** - Generate documents for manufacturing and installation

13. How does the workflow handle measurement accuracy and installation precision?
**Answer:**
• **Physical measurements** - Use measuring tape for critical elements (e.g., window frames)
• **Point cloud scans** - For general store geometry and context
• **Component-based modeling** - Ensures all campaign elements fit precisely
• **Layout documents** - Provide installers with exact dimensions, materials, and placement guides
• **Feedback loop** - Installation teams provide updates for continuous improvement

14. What are the key principles of effective window display design covered in the session?
**Answer:**
• **Simplicity** - Avoid overcrowding, focus on a single product or theme
