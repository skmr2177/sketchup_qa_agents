# Everything You Need to Know You Learned in Archite - Q&A

Here is a comprehensive Q&A covering the key points from the tutorial:

Q1. What are the main challenges Brenda faces in providing residential architecture services for typical single-family homes?
A1. The main challenges are: 1) In many areas, it is not required to hire an architect for smaller residential projects under a certain square footage. 2) Most single-family homes and renovations are handled directly by builders without architect involvement. 3) It can be difficult to quantify and prove the value of hiring an architect for residential projects, especially in the early design phases.

Q2. What is Brenda's proposed solution to address the housing crisis and aging residential infrastructure?
A2. Brenda proposes using SketchUp and the architectural design process to provide affordable design and planning services for mid-size homes and renovations. This allows homeowners to get professional design input to maximize the value and longevity of their home projects.

Q3. What are the four phases of Brenda's schematic design process?
A3. The four phases are: 1) Pre-Design Study and Document Prep, 2) Schematic Design, 3) Material and Finish, 4) Drawings and Deliverables.

Q4. What key SketchUp deliverables are produced in the Pre-Design phase?
A4. The key deliverables are a pre-design report, a study model geolocated on the site, and sometimes jello cube massing models to explore adjacencies and siting.

Q5. How does the Schematic Design phase work?
A5. It involves interactive design meetings with the client, moving things around in the SketchUp model in real-time. Multiple design solutions are explored and tested, with printable meeting notes generated after each meeting using SketchUp Layout.

Q6. What happens in the Material and Finish phase?
A6. Schematic exterior finishes, windows, roofs are added to the model to bring it out of the "SketchUp look". Any special design features the client wants are sketched in so the builder is aware of them for pricing.

Q7. What deliverables are provided in the Drawings and Deliverables phase?
A7. The key deliverables are schematic construction sets, renderings, video walkthroughs, and sometimes construction drawings if working directly with a contractor. The level of detail is tailored based on whether a contractor is involved yet.

Q8. How does Brenda structure her proposals and budgets?
A8. Each of the four phases has a minimum and maximum time/cost budget defined upfront. This gives clients cost transparency and allows Brenda to properly scope and charge for the services provided in each phase.

Q9. How does Brenda approach construction phase services?
A9. Brenda will only provide full construction drawings if working as a subcontractor directly with a licensed, insured builder who is pulling permits. Otherwise, she stays out of the construction details and instead helps moderate design decisions between the owner and builder as needed.

Q10. What does Brenda see as the key benefit of her SketchUp-based process?
A10. It allows her to efficiently design mid-size homes within an affordable budget in a way that maximizes value for the client. Clients can see the design vision and participate in the process, while Brenda focuses on the early design phases where architects provide the most impact.
