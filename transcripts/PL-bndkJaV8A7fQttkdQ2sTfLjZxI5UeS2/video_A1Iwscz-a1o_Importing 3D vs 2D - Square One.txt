hey i'm aaron and this is sketchup square one where we take a look at the basics of using sketchup today we'll take a look at importing files into sketchup so one of the cool things about sketchup is it can work with a lot of different file types i would imagine we'll probably make a series of videos just on the different files that we can import and how to use each one today we want to do a super high level importing files into sketchup we're going to look at pulling in 2d and 3d files right now okay so here i'm in sketchup a brand new model nothing going on here so we're just going to pull some files right in here i'm going to go up to file and everything we'll look at is right here in import so click on import all right so it's going to drop a list down here and it's going to you know this is all standard fare navigating to where your files are saved what we want to look at is this format down at the bottom so let me go ahead and expand this so there's two different types of files or two different families of files you can import in sketchup 3d files and 2d files image files would be 2d so up here at the top we have all the 3d files so here from skp down to stl we have skp files dem ifc dwg dxf stl dae dmz 3ds obj and stl files i know i went through that super fast but when you open up sketchup you'll see the exact same list so you don't have to take notes writing that down these are 3d files these will pull in three-dimensional geometry how it pulls in or what it pulls in will be different based on the file type below that we have our image files bmp jpeg png psd tiff tga and pdf files most of these are bitmap type images so most of these are going to pull in raster images which are just going to show up as you know just images on on there it is possible to pull in a pdf with vector imagery but for this we're just going to be talking primarily about just these images they're going to pull in as flat images and we'll just kind of throw them wherever we need to use them so we're going to take a look right now at pulling in a sample 3d file and a sample 2d file we'll start with the 3d so each of these 3d files is going to have a little bit different workflow that is the information that you can pull in and the control you have over how you pull it in is going to change depending on the file so the information that's available to change on your import to dxf file is going to be different from what's in an stl file because the data that's stored in that file type is a little bit different so we're going to take a look at a dxf file so when you choose the type of file you want to import you are going to have for the most part there's a couple that don't have a configuration option but most of them have this configure button clicking the configure button will allow you to choose how you want to import those files so like i said we'll go into the specifics in a separate file maybe dxf and dwg files will have their own file we can talk about what each of these mean turn them on and off and see how they affect the import for right now i'm just going to import it with the default configuration and i'm going to go grab this dxf file you can see one of the things that happens is when you choose a specific file format anything that is not that file format is grayed out so i can't pick on the png file right now but i can choose this dxf file and i'm going to click import when i click import it's going to run me through a couple screens here kind of just detailing the import process it is possible to hit errors here where there's bad data where it can't import the file if so it will tell you that once imported it will give you a summary and again the data that shows up here the import results are going to vary file type by file type but in general it's going to tell you whether it imported properly or not so in this case i'm just going to go ahead and hit close and there we go boom it imports that dxf file and when it imports a dxf file it does put the entire thing in a group going into that group will let you actually interact with the dxf as it existed when it was created to be imported so this can sometimes mean there's an extra layer here where i want to explode once to get rid of that container it created to put the dxf file into and then this is the actual contents of the dxf inside here is you know an extra piece so that's going to vary based on how the file was created though how many how many layers deep the groups are that sort of thing but once it's pulled in it will show up inside of a group that of course can be moved so if i want to move something i can just you know grab my move command move it around that sort of thing pretty simple at that point all right let's look at importing a 2d file so i'm going to go to import again i'm going to go to my types and we're going to scroll down look at these ones at the bottom so down here i do have a filter here where i can say all supported image types show me everything that's an image type that's support that way if you have a bunch of files and it's not just this one basic file like i have you'll see all of them at the same time i'm going to go ahead and just say i want to bring in a png file now something is different about importing 2d than 3d files right off the bat that is this little drop down right here when you choose an image type it's going to come up and say do you want to import as an image as a texture or as a matched photo so texture and match photo will actually get their own videos also we'll talk about importing and using different images as textures we'll also go into probably quite a bit of depth about match photo in the future right now i just want to talk about importing as an image this pretty much parallels what we were just looking at for 3d imports so i'm going to turn on use as image and i'm going to import this 2d.png and say import what happens with importing an image is when you come out here it's going to be connected to your cursor it's asking you to pick the first point so i'm going to go ahead and just grab a spot on the red axis here i'm just going to click once and now what i can do is i can drag out and click as big as i want this to be i can also specify an exact height down here so if i want this to be i don't know exactly 10 feet tall i can type in 10 foot and hit enter and there we go that is now imported exactly 10 feet tall if i look at this now similar to what happened when i pulled in the 3d my 2d file import is also inside of a group it's a special group though this is not just a regular group like well frankly like what the 3d file's in if i go to entity info and i pick on the 3d file it tells me it's got a component highlighted so that's how to import and import it into a component if i pick my 2d import it tells me that it's an image it also tells me what png file is being displayed and what the exact size of it is so this is this is unique because this is not a regular group what this is actually doing is it's created so i can't like i can't double click and then try to enter the group or anything an image is a special kind of group that contains a face with this material placed on it but as long as this image is in this special image group this 2d texture that i i just selected is not going to actually show up as a material if i go into like my paint bucket tool or anything like that as long as it's in here as an image it's special it's set apart so this is something you might use if you're say you wanted to import like a poster to put on a wall or you wanted to import an image for the ground to to reference something like that where you want this to not be a material you're going to use as a texture anywhere in the model and you want it to stay inside its own container then image is what you want to use so very specific examples but that is the difference between importing 3d and importing 2d like i said we'll dive a little bit deeper into those specific file formats in later videos so that was intended to be fairly high level really the difference between importing a 3d versus a 2d file how that process goes and what it's going to look like to import each we'll go into some more depth later but right now we just got to toe in the water before we dive in if you like that video go ahead and click like

know how we're doing what you think of these square one videos and what pieces you would like to see explored next we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing
