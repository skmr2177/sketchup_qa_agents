hey everyone eric here and today i want to share with you a few of my tips for tracing on top of imported reference images [Music] so you're probably thinking what's the big deal i'm just drawing lines on top of an image pretty straightforward actually what i've found having done this a bunch of times whether i'm drawing on top of an imported cat survey a hand sketch or even a photograph is that sometimes when i'm drawing black lines in sketchup on top of black lines in my image it's going to be hard for me to see what i've just drawn so i want to share with you some of my experience setting up custom styles and applying them to scenes to make the overall drafting process smoother so let's get to it as you can see here i've already got a reference plan imported and scaled i've also got it assigned to its own tag so i can toggle it on and off so now i'm ready just to start drawing over the top nothing fancy here i'm just going to draw a few lines and hopefully to prove my point the lines i've just drawn are kind of hard to see well they are for me i assume they are for you too now of course i could continue to go up here and toggle my reference image off and on and say okay yeah that's how far i've got or i could maybe hover over the top and look for that end point to snap to but for me i like to go a little quicker than that and i want to make sure that as i'm drafting it's going as the whole process runs as efficiently as possible the other thing when i switch the rectangle tool you'll notice that if i go ahead and say copy over draw a rectangle over the top of this table i've actually lost what's underneath because a face automatically fills in over the top but i've got more details i want to draw here so let me show you how to set up some styles in order to be able to see not only my lines better but also what's underneath the faces that fill in let's start by going up to view and then face style and x-ray so x-ray does two things it not only fades the image back a little bit making the lines a little easier to see but it also makes the faces transparent so i can continue just to draft the details actually on top of the faces that are covering the reference plan of course if i wanted to go a little bit further i can also open up my styles and if that black line still is difficult to see in some areas we can actually go to edit and change the line color itself in this case i like to use a hot pink of course you can use any color you want as long as it contrasts with the plan that you're drawing on top of and then to save that change go back to your styles and just make sure to add the plus icon to save that to a new style so now i can actually switch back and forth between the default style and my new tracing style now let's go ahead and apply that to a scene i'll start by creating just two new scenes one two and then this second one i'm going to make sure it's already applied it's already got the tracing style applied so that's great going back to that first scene up here at the top or in your scenes window however you like to do it just go ahead and make sure that that default style is applied and then update that scene now i'm going to go i'm also going to turn off the reference image because as i'm drafting it's easier for me to see how i'm doing by turning that image off so i can just click the scene tab to toggle those on and off all of those settings go ahead and click update and now i can just go back and forth between my tracing scene with my tracing style applied and my default scene which has the default style applied so that's great now the only problem here is and let me show you i'll give you an example here let's say my kitchen is looking good and i want to go and move over to this lounge area maybe i need to zoom in because i'm doing some details and i need to get a little closer so i can see where those edges are well if i go back now at this point to the default scene you can see it's going to take me back all the way to the front kitchen sorry where i left off in the kitchen i don't really like that i like to stay focused on the area that i'm working so what i'll do is open up the little drop down in the scenes window and make sure that for both of these two scenes that i created i'll disable the camera location for each so now if i go back to say my drafting scene and continue to work on this lounge area a little bit maybe draw a couch and my coffee table and the rug that this all sits in now i can check really quickly i can say oh yes that's coming together nicely i like that and same thing if i were to pop back to my drafting mode and then maybe work on a table over here at any point in the time no matter where you are because camera location is disabled you can just go ahead and click between the two and you're good to go so you're probably thinking yes that's useful but it's a little bit of work to set all that stuff up and maybe don't want to do that every single time and i don't blame you i wouldn't want to do that every time either i work with images a lot and if i could set this up as a template that would be really awesome so let's actually do that i'm just going to go ahead and erase everything that's in the model but i'm not going to purge it because the reason why is because i have these styles the scenes and my tag still in the model and i want to save those as part of my template so let's go up here to file not open from template but if you go down to save as a template in this case i can give it a name call it image trace maybe it's just something that i can remember now if this is checked you probably want to make sure this is not your default template unless you only trace images in this case i do it every now and then so i'm not going to set this as my default i'm going to go ahead and hit save if you've already got one in here because i've done this before i'm just going to overwrite it for this demo so when you're ready to do this for your next project all you have to do is then go up to file new from template and then just make sure to go over to my templates and here you can see the one that we just created together called image trace i'll go ahead and click on that to launch it and there it is i actually have another image that i want to work on so i'm just going to drag that in just to show you how easy it is to get up and running let's say i want to work on this little floor plan of the sketch that i did for a cabin concept all i have to do from here is just with the image selected apply that image to the reference tag and all the other settings will be there so now i can switch back and forth between my trace mode and my default settings and just to make that a little bit easier to see i'll just throw some line work on top i'm in my trace mode now maybe i'll do my kitchen table maybe i'll do a little living room sofa here and obviously you get the idea so i'll stop it there so that's it for my tips for drafting on top of imported reference images hopefully you found something useful in this video and as always be sure to like comment and subscribe we actually read the comments so if you have either a better or a different way to do it let us know and we'll keep the conversation going there thanks as always and see you next time [Music] you
