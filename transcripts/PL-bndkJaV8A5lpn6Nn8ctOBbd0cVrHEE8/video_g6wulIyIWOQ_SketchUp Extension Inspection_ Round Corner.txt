Kind: captions Language: en Hey guys, this is Aaron. I want to take a look at the extension today RoundCorner. Now, we get the question a lot, "How do I smooth out something? Make the corners soft?" That kind of thing. And the easiest way to do it is with the extension RoundCorner by Fredo6. It is available in the Extension Warehouse. Just a note: if you do go grab RoundCorner you also have to download Fredo's library which is called LibFredo. So make sure you get that and install that as well as RoundCorner. RoundCorner is pretty easy to use. Select the lines or edges you want to round off and click one of three buttons here. I'm going to click on the first one, we'll go through exactly what each of these does in just a moment, but just to show you how this works. Fredo's UI pops up and you end up with a lot of options, I'm not going to go through everything in here because it's supposed to be a quick overview, but it is worth digging into once you download and install it. The simple part is I can set my offset, how far I am going to push back these rounded corners, and how many segments do I want on each? I'm going to go with an inch and a half offset on this die and five segments. I'm going to click to run that. That rounds off all those corners that were selected. Thus the name RoundCorner. If I turn on hidden geometry I can see exactly what that did. It broke it up into a bunch of segments to soften that shape up. And, speaking of soften, that's exactly what it did: it went in and softened all those pieces so I have this nice smooth shape on my die. I mentioned there are three different buttons here. The first one is going to give me this kind of corner. My second button takes the round corners and kind of run them out to a point. So I still have this point out here. You can kind of see how that sticks out. This first option gives you more geometry but it will give you nice rounded corners in addition to the rounded edges. This worked on inside corners as well as outside corners. The third option is not really a rounded corner as much as a cut off corner. So at 45 degrees it goes through and merges the two planes that are against each other. These are the three options for RoundCorner. If I look at them without the hidden lines you can kind of see what kind of geometry you'll get. The nice thing about this extension is it's a very easy to use extension.So I can do things like grab a bunch of geometry at once and just run RoundCorner on the whole thing. Now RoundCorner with come up and tell you if you have issues. If the rounded parts are going to lap over each other, create odd geometry, it'll flag that. But if your geometry is good all you have to do is click and you end up with nice soft geometry. So it's a great tool, easy to use, it's a free extension available on our Extension Warehouse right now. That's RoundCorner from Fredo6. Thank you!
