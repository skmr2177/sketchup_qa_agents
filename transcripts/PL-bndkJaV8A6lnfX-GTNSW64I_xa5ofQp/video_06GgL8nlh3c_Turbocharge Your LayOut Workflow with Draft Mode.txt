hey everyone Eric here and today I want to show you a couple different ways to boost the performance efficiency and speed of working in [Music] layout okay so for those of you that work on really big models or really detailed construction documents and if you're like me and you spend some time in layout sometimes you'll find that the more information you get the heavier your model gets and the more detailed your construction documentation gets uh performance could possibly slow down now the latest version what I'm using here behind me version 2024 has a few tricks on how to deal with that let's go ahead and take a look right now okay so here I am in my layout file now I'm not going to go into detail about how I created this file necessarily or why I've set it up cuz that's not really the point of this video what I want to do is is look at things like if I'm going to be working on you know tracing and annotating and stacking viewports I want to make things sure that things are going quickly for me and smoothly so let's pop over to a context or concept plan diagram that I am in the process of building out one that kind of shows this potential project location in sort of a block or walk uh walking diagram and the other one sort of more a site specific diagram again that's not the point but that's what we're working with so what I want to do firstly is come over here to depending on if you're on a Mac or PC it's going to be a different location but I'm going to go layout settings um also called preferences and then here I want to show you if you're not already on there find performance so performance there's a couple things when I said there's a couple things um one of them you don't really have to do anything it's called Graphics engine and layout has a new EXP experimental Graphics engine which helps with performance gains now this is all under the hood stuff so I don't exactly know how this works but by default it should be enabled so when I turn that on and off you might see sort of the viewports or something render and that's also why it says experimental Graphics engine so you know um if you do come across any problems you could always disable that but I like to keep that going I definitely want to make sure that that is is enabled so while I'm in the preferences the second thing I want to show you here is draft mode now you may have seen this in aon's you know what's new in 2024 video but I want to go a little bit more in depth of how this works so draft mode is kind of an optional setting you'll notice that if I'm not in draft mode if I'm zooming and panning right or if I'm drawing lines or if I'm trying to move objects you notice that everything in my viewport stays rendered so that's kind of the default way that layout works so you've got Shadows you've got lines you've got the model underneath you've got the SketchUp model that sits underneath all this this line work now what draft mode does if I come back over here and enable that it gives you a few options firstly it says do you want it always on or do you want it to only be on for pan and zoom and the second thing it gives you option it gives you is you want to turn off the SketchUp viewport and or do you want to turn off or disable rastered rendered objects let's go and turn off let's make sure that all of those are checked and for right now I'm going to say pan and zoom only and you're going to see why in a second because I'm going to change that and we're going to look at another way to turn this on and off so I'm going to close that and again now what happens here you can see when I move the viewport now when I zoom in the SketchUp model because the SketchUp model is set to raster currently you can see if I zoom in I've got my rendering mode set to raster it kind of disappears now not only does that disappear but any other raster objects on the page like in this case my SketchUp logo is raster so as I'm panning or as I'm zooming all that stuff just turns off and that's cool because even though I didn't really see um any slowdown with this particular layout I've got sort of two SketchUp viewports and I've got a series of line weights and sort of annotations on top of it I've got an image um that's not really enough I think maybe to sort of slow me down but even things like turning Shadows on you'll notice the Shadows turn off and you're getting you're left with almost like a preview of your line work now let's say I want to keep my SketchUp showing there's a couple different ways we can do that we can either switch our render mode so if I come into my SketchUp viewport I can switch from raster to either vector or hybrid and then if I pop out of there you'll notice when I pan and zoom it's still disappearing but that's because in the settings I said disable SketchUp viewport so if I turn that off now it doesn't matter if raster rendered objects is still enabled if I now pan and zoom you can see that I'm able to leave my SketchUp model in place and all of the sort of heavier rendered objects like shadows and thick line weights and images and things like that that'll go ahead and turn off as I'm working in draft mode now I'm only doing this for again I'm doing this for pan and zoom only but if you really wanted to you could leave draft mode always on like for example if I knew I was going to do some annotations like I want to come over here and do some dimensioning it could be a smart idea to have draft mode left always on because then you can see here let me go ahead and actually this is a good point for me to switch gears and say well wait a minute I want to go back and and forth between showing draft mode draft mode and not showing it and I don't want to go back into settings and then turning on and turning off every single time that's just going of be a little bit of pain because I know I'm going to want to go back and forth between draft mode and my preview mode so here I can come over to shortcuts and type in draft and you may already have a key established I'm going to go ahead and add shift d for that and shift d because I'm thinking turn on draft mode so shift D um and then let's see what happens so now I don't have to go back into that system preferences I don't have to come back here and click that button every single time and enable and disable I just hit shift d and what it does is it gives me my preview mode and shift d gives me my draft mode and notice the difference here maybe this is not the best example up here for example if I want to do some dimensioning I've got some thick line weights I've got some rastered edges I've got property line Shadows I've got all this information well I just hit shift d on my keyboard and now I'm left with just this sort of simple boundary now I can come over here and draw a line and snap to that or again I can grab um not shift d but D see that's why I said shift d because now I want to grab a dimension and I can see that corner much easier um compared to when I have this thick all these thick line weights and layered graphics on top so that's really cool I'm seeing that you know the combination of of whether I want to use the raster for my SketchUp model whether I want to go hybrid whether I want to show draft mode only when I'm panning and zooming or whether I want to use it as a key cut or shortcut key excuse me so that I can just kind of decide um you know so I can work on just various elements like I want to just Dimension this here and then you can see there's just zero hang zero lag doesn't matter how many how heavy um my model is which this model here is um a pretty decent model that I've working on that I used doesn't matter sort of how much information I bring in to layout it's going to just kind of keep performing nice and quick for me so again it's not bad for me with all everything turned on but if you do find yourself for any reason with things starting to slow down just enable that draft mode and whether you want to do it with a keyboard shortcut or um just panning and zooming it's kind of going to be an option for you so that's it again use that experimental Graphics give it a try if you have any problems with it you can always turn it off it is experimental by the way and then that draft mode it's a really cool thing um again I think you can't take my word for it you just got to go try it yourself and you got to see the difference because it's also going to depend on your computer it's going to depend on the model that you're working on and it's going to depend on what you're doing in your layout viewport you know what kinds of styles are you using what are you stacking on top of it you know what are you layering and I think ultimately the customizability to let you sort of figure out what works for your workflow um I really like it I'm digging it I'm going to say let's keep using that I love that keyboard shortcut so I want to leave you there again go out and try it yourself and uh while you're at it if you learned something new if you haven't tried draft mode if you haven't if you've been hesitant to get into layout now's your chance jump in version 2024 and I will leave you there thanks for watching and see you next time
