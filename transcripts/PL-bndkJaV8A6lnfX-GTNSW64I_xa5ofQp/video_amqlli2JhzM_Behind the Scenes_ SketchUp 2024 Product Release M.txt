hey everyone Eric here and today we're going to go slightly Beyond SketchUp desktop in order to look at both the inspiration and some of the tools and methods that I used to create this model here behind me which you might recognize from our 2024 product [Music] release so this was actually a really fun internal project for me to get to be a part of so I'm super excited to share a little bit of a sneak peek behind the scenes of course we won't cover everything because the model you know has different parts and has different levels of detail and there's some extensions used so we'll cover some different parts and different lessons but right now I just kind of want to take you through the thought process from where we started from just hey we need a model for 2024 come up with something to testing it to then checking to see how it fits within the different use cases so the different views and and in the model or the sort of the login window and then ultimately to the final product that you see here on the screen so let's just go ahead and get to it I've got this model but I want to sort of take a step back we're going to kind of play with it we're going to kind of spin around and turn toggle some things on and off here in just a second but what I want to do is kind of take a little bit of a step back I want to go back in time to where this started so we were tasked with uh here in SketchUp in the internal marketing and content team was tasked with creating an advertisement in a Design Awards flyer so we knew that it had to speak to architecture landscape and interiors and we knew that it had to be a portrait orientation so we were going to emphasiz this verticality we also knew that we needed some room for text and we needed um a space for a logo so that was kind of basically the design brief that we worked on so you know just kind of scouring the internet like we do looked at some materialities wood and green looked at things that are hanging Vines climbing vines hanging to sort of emphasize the ver ality that you see in an A4 portrait or or like a basically a letter A4 is what you would see in the metric system but it' be equivalent to like a letter page that you'd see in a magazine spread and then popping over to looking at sort of the lightness and the brightness and was this a Tech campus could it be a school could it be a co-working there's lots of different uses that we wanted to keep open-ended and of course thinking about this sort of iconic canopy piece something that sort of stops your eye as your eye goes up something inspired by in this case this is the British museum if anyone's been to the British museum in London and just has this big gigantic glass canopy covering what feels like an outdoor street so kind of blurring the line again between what is exterior and what is interior what is landscape architecture what is architecture so this is kind of our starting point I'm going to leave it here had to start with something and then pop over to SketchUp an early model sort of a first pass model that was built for the advertisement before we started planning for 2024 release was looking almost like a stage set it was like what's the least amount we need to build in order to get the view that we want and I was thinking originally that we would look at the corner because even though it's a um because there's something Dynamic about that two-point perspective and these columns in this case don't actually hold anything up now you might say they're unreasonably tall or they structurally they're not sound and that's you're probably right um I'm not a structural designer my background's in landscape and and um and visualization so in this case I got to kind of play architect and play interior designer and play structural um engineer and it was it was a lot of fun so in this case you could see here that the intent was to kind of focus on just the patterning sort of the rhythm of the Mion that you kind of see and which is based off of essentially just a couple of components so if I go into the facade group and I go into this group and you can see that not only is this panel itself a component but you can see that this group of panels is also a component so I basically just copied this little component this little facade component and then by mirroring it so essentially using the flip tool or if you want to go old school you can go old school like this and uh get some variety you can go you can can't really get variety going top down it's going to look the same but if you scale it this way way um then you get a different pattern so by creating by sort of mixing and matching these little individual pieces you can see if I select that one all of these larger pieces highlight so again trying to use components trying to be smart about it trying to create variety where um so it looks interesting so if I wanted to take the same one here I could grab that rotate at 90Â° and place this module just basically wherever I want it's designed to sort of fit then of course I would remove the Mion wherever that fits so that's a component too so if you make a change everything's components make a change to one makes a change to all of them you can see of course I don't really want to do that but you get the idea this is my color by tag color by tag shows the organization and I usually go to a working tag when I'm just kind of playing around and then when I'm ready to start start thinking about camera angles I'll throw a waterm mark in there with a composition grid and I'll just kind of sort of just tweak what does it look like if we zoom in a little bit what does it look like if we zoom out are we leaving room for a logo are we leaving room for some copy text at the top and that's sort of the Genesis of the concept now this is all this is where we left off for the ad where we um finished here was something like this so this is what went to print and I think it just came out really nice and it's a nice blend it draws your eye both up and back down and it sort of has some articulation on the ground floor and it just kind of worked out really nice so that's why that so we said well let's expand on that idea so back in SketchUp and flipping over to my finished model what we have here was basically we needed more than just a corner so we couldn't just do that corner anymore we needed a lot we needed to be able to see this thing basically from any angle we needed to be able to spin around it we needed to be able to zoom out an aerial section Cuts all this stuff go to layout so basically taking this building making this entire building a component so that you can see here if I select something like this here you can't see it because it's on the other side it's mirrored but basically you can see when I select a part of the building the one on the opposite so I'm really just making using a visual trick here to basically reduce the amount of work that I have to do by just copying the building and sliding it over the nice thing about this is when you're in the courtyard it sort of frames your view you don't really see this necessarily as just a a repeat because when you're looking this way you can see the opening on this side but when you're looking not from inside the building probably from here you can see it's over here so it looks just a little bit different based on which angle you're coming into the courtyard which I think um is cool canopy itself I'm going to not go into a lot of detail about this because I want to do a special video just on how the canopy was built because took a couple of tries to kind of get it right and um playing around with some extensions but the canopy exercise was quite fun because because I knew that it wanted to cover the entire Courtyard so that was the size of it I knew that it wanted some movement so it felt more like a cloud rather than just a straight shot which would feel very forced and I knew that I wanted it you needed to be made up of some smaller pieces of glass that again goes back to that image at the British museum that I was kind of inspired by there would be some sort of structure that would hold the pieces of glass in order to get that sort of wav likee movement again I'm not structural engineer I'm just kind of coming up with the concept and it's somebody else's job to help me figure out if it's buildable and then um from there you know again looking at some different studies and looking at some different Alternatives and playing with the undulation of the canopy because what that did is it really let me um in particular from this view let me go to this view here it's almost looks at this point like this canopies being lifted up like a blanket or a curtain or something like that and it's revealing the people that are standing up here on that balcony so there's just little kind of subtle things that were done that if you kind of pay attention and you look you'll see those kinds of fun little things so again just to kind of wrap this part up it was important that we looked at the courtyard from different angles here it is from sort of the side view and again with or without out Shadows on here it is from sort of again just off center what would it look like to get up high and look back down then of course an image I think you've seen before especially dat when we were showing off the ambient occlusion which is this interior shot here so that was kind of really cool because again you can still see the courtyard in the background so you're always your eye always knows where you are no matter where you're looking at or which Vantage Point you're using As you move around the so lastly I want to kind of wrap up by showing um by showing you this cool thing that I started experimenting with here in SketchUp which is where are these going from here so here in the SketchUp team in the marketing team we these images go to 3D Warehouse they go to blogs welcome Windows they do they go to sliders they go to all kinds of different things so we wanted to kind of look at what would that look like to bring in the welcome window so do we want to be the first thing see when you sign in to SketchUp 2024 it could be an interior now the nice thing is that this is not going to photoshop we're doing we're bringing the mockups the graphic design mocks into SketchUp so if I wanted to tweak this angle a little bit you know I wanted to kind of look around and see well what would that look like if you Chang the camera the field of view what would it look like if you turn the people on and off you could kind of get that um you could kind of play around straight into SketchUp and you could still see the relationship of the model to the mock which I thought was a really cool technique and I really enjoyed testing that out same thing with 3D Warehouse so you can see that the mockup behind you can see it remembers the camera angle so all it's doing is putting a watermark on top of this and then it's allowing me to sort of pick the view of the model that I think I mean that's kind of cool because there's this really long element here in when you're searching in 3D warehouse and then there's this person walking into the frame that almost that's looking down at the phone but it's also almost looks like they're looking down at the search bar and then there's people hanging out I mean this is a great image because some of these things I found from 3D Warehouse I have to admit that you know there's no reason for me to model a chair from scratch when it's something that's relatively easy to go and find one from 3D Warehouse so again looking at things like our blog um grabbing a screenshot I know the blog changes and I know graphic design changes so this won't always be the way that it is but if I wanted to see what this particular View which is the twoo which is this twoo corner and then I go back to the blog again again all I have to do then is just grab my hand tool and then lift this up into place wherever I think it makes the most sense and then what I would do is I would use this information to inform the marketing team I would say Okay um of course you don't have to do what I think works but this if I need to move an umbrella or if I need to hide this one because this lamp post right here um this is a really great shot but I don't like the way that the lamp is intersecting with the up in SketchUp you just hide that and then come over here and say okay cool that works a lot better so that's a really great way for me to sort of quickly and easily iterate and sort of communicate with the marketing team by bringing in the watermarks of where the imagery is going to go um after that and of course we go to layout and we go to other places which is why a model that has the right amount of detail is so important because it doesn't just live in SketchUp as you know you're going to see this in layout you're going to see this in product demos you're going to see this in animations you're going to see this in webinars so really thinking about a level of detail that works at different levels so I'll zoom out and we'll just kind of see what we've got here and there it is it's even placed within context I know this is not a real project it's not a real project site but even then we can kind of get a sense that it is in an urban environment like a walkable city or a downtown so I'm going to stop there because unfortunately well not unfortunately for better for worse I actually can keep going there's a lot of little tricks and again the extensions that I used and mostly just trying things and see what works I think design is one of those things where you can't predict the outcome always and so you can kind of look at it and say okay does that feel right should I shift something does it need to goow taller and I think that's just the Beauty and the joy of just working in SketchUp and being able to create use the tools that we share with you in these videos we actually use those tools that's really important for me to basically reinforce the storytelling like we're we're doing the same things that you guys are all doing out there and we have um we have the same pleasure and we also have sometimes the same friction and we're always working to improve that and make it a better experience So speaking of better experience I hope you got something out of this video hope at least you enjoyed getting Peak behind the Curt of what we do here over at SketchUp and with that I'm going to say thank you don't forget to give us that thumbs up if you like this video if you haven't already subscribe so you can get all the latest content when it comes out and I will say a thank you and see you next time [Music]
