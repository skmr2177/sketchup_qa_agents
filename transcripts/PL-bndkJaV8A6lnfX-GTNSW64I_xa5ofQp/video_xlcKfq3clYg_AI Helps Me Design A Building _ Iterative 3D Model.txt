e [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music] [Music] [Music] all right hey folks welcome it is Friday it is noon m mountain time that means we're doing SketchUp live whoa I don't know if anybody else seeing that but I got some camera stuff happening oh my gosh this is the max it's all over the place Max Headroom version of uh SketchUp live here a dated reference but yeah wow so that's fun um yeah that was working really well 30 minutes ago go so maybe maybe it's just a thing that had to get out of its system but hey we're here talking about AI so maybe it lines up um I'm upsetting the AI overlords and they're making me flicker make you doubt if I'm real or not um but uh yeah I'm here oops the screen says Donovan but wow everything's rough Charles is with me here today hey Charles hello it's me Donovan Charles Donovan today it's Friday you know we had AIA last weekend we're still getting back into the swing of things you know I've been sick all week I don't blame it's it's all right we're so here's what upsets me though about this is that I just week before last went and bought a new camera because this is what was happening with the old camera and I thought I had dialed it into the problem was in fact the camera but uh now it's pretty I mean that the solution is plain I need to just quit and never stream again well don't do that the audience needs you we need you you good times good times are had by everybody okay well hey guys welcome to live um we're going to we're going to muscle through we're going to make this work um so if I'm flickering too much just look down at your keyboards or off in the distance and just listen to my voice um we're going to go into this so so our our idea for for our live modeling this week is we want to Model A A A nice a high-end residence so I don't know anything other than that we're going to model a building that is going to be a house for someone somewhere um we're not going to go to off the off the rails not gonna video just to just to cut you off I'm super sorry Erin we may need to stop this and reset and jump back in the the video is very choppy for everybody yeah unfortunately that's what I'm seeing in obs too so it is not a streaming thing so much as it is a a hear thing let me folks let me poke at something real quick cool what could possibly go wrong how's the audio audience how are you let's let's chat while while aon's figuring stuff out I want to see how y'all are doing we've got people from Sweden Brazil we've got Denmark Angola Max Headroom is here everybody's talking about Mex [Laughter] Headroom yeah Andy's got me I I uh revealed that I stream through a PC so that's obviously the issue it's a Mac versus PC thing all right so I dropped the frame rate extremely low and it doesn't seem to be flickering anymore but there's a little bit of delay but we're streaming anyhow so uh yeah I got things I can poke at as we do this um you're getting like five frames a second yeah that's all right let's try doubling see if we can get up to 10 all right this is 48 frame o that looks pretty smooth and I don't see a flicker yet oh I don't you know I don't know that we could get any realer than this like you want you want the real deal we do it real here right and it seems like the audio is good just the video side of things you know what why can we how about this if the video is still choppy oh there we go oh snap it's working now I'm seeing it looking you're looking good what I'll do is I've got a photo of you if for some reason something happens where we need to take um your camera down for the episode I took this really great photo of you at um at AIA that haven't really talked about yet I'm going to photoshop it quick while we're on the call so that you can just overlay it onto the screen good thinking yeah you should probably drop that into the uh The Forum post about this live stream so we can share with the world or maybe not I haven't seen it I shouldn't be saying things like that okay let's move forward we're we are hopefully past the technical issues the stream looks like it's going pretty good right now everything seems to be going pretty well um my green my chroma key got a little fuzzy because I changed the frame rate but uh I think we can suffer through that so back to what we're talking about uh I want to design a custom home a residence of some sort uh and I said I want to be like well I don't know exactly what I want to be that's why you're here I want you guys to help me uh use diffusion to create design a structure that I have no idea about yet so we're going to use diffusion to go in and do things like you know like getting initial massing get initial size what what's the porch going to look like what's the entry going to look like what's this roof going to look like we're going to throw all of that onto the fusion so we're going to do some some generative design steps using the fusion where it's going to tell us you know give us ideas for how to build this how to design this and we'll go in and design that into the SketchUp model and we'll kind of do that iteratively so I have no idea how this is going to go just be plain right um I think it'll be good I think it'll be fun uh we seem to got the Gremlins out of the system so that's a plus uh so we're just going to hop in and start doing this thing all right um so here's a thing I'm gon to ask for uh because a lot of you have seen me try to type so I'm going to say why don't we if you're not already there hop on over to forums. sketchup.com and uh as we start doing these prompts to tell uh the fusion what we want you can actually just type them into the forum and I'll just copy and paste them in rather than trusting me to spell things right especially you know big words like multi- syllable words um so yeah if you go over there uh AI helps me design a building is the name of the topic hop in there and we'll use that to pass prompts back and forth cool um do you want me to monitor that or um please I mean I'll have it up so I can copy it over but uh yeah I can't I can't pay attention to too many things at once not a multitasker um but that's okay all right so here's what I'm to do I'm going to start with nothing we're we're going to look at like this we're going to start with an empty plot of land I'm going to hop in to diffusion um and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here and I'm just going to say don't even worry about my model geometry slide it all the way down I don't care about that slide my prompt influence way up and now we're going to tell it what kind of structure we want so like I said I know I want a home I'm thinking like a decent Siz home one of the things we want to do with this is collaboratively uh lay out the house and and design different rooms so throughout the next couple weeks we might be doing a kitchen design and a living room design or bedroom design that kind of stuff by taking chunks out of this house and then designing them so I want to come up with a fairly big structure not not huge I want to do like a 10,000 foot home or anything like that um so no Elon Elon Musk houses either big or his teeny tiny little house neither of those somewhere in the in the middle so my question for you all is what kind of house should we go for um I was thinking something fairly modern but I'm not really sure what kind of terms to use uh something like 3,000 single family 3,000 foot single family home um I don't want to go like too like I said too crazy like bow house or cyber Punk or anything like that but what's a what's a good house type that you designer architect type people would use in saying this would be a good house what do you got so at this point we're totally dreaming so hit me with your thoughts either you could put it into the chat or we could throw it into the uh The Forum cool I'm uh monitoring both oh stop Vincent said Frank G no we're not GNA crumple up a piece of paper and design that on this stream modern ranch style family home of 3,000 square feet this is a great start so I am going to copy that sorry for my screen flicker I just had to click out um oops apparently I copied a bunch of empty space with that all right so we got some other ideas here I like it I like when you guys barrage me with input y are so creative today I know I like it I like that I'm going to add that more words I can add the better M mid-century modern all right like that we got mid-century in there a couple all right I'm going to hit it I'm going to see what happens so right now so I'm in diffusion if you guys haven't used before this is SketchUp diffusion this is a free extension available from SketchUp Labs anybody who has a current subscription can run this um it's pretty simple we've done several videos on so I'm kind of glazing over the first part and just going to the parts are important like I said I'm got my prompt in here I'm not worried about a style at this point um but I am telling it don't don't worry about this don't worry about uh model geometry just give me my prompt give me a lot of my prompt and I'm going to hit generate it's going to run off do its magical diffusion AI thing and it'll come back and give me three uh possible solutions that we could work from for mid-century modern Ranch uh here we go all right so here's what we got a couple of okay that's kind of fun o that's what yeah I don't care for that style um printed on a burl sap B Bur forlap sack please um this is kind of fun I don't know what this thing is up here but it's it's neat looking um okay that's kind of kind of cool what do you guys feel anybody feeling anything real strong here I really don't care for number one honestly I don't like that uh this is kind of cool it's a little low it's a little uh dark I kind of personally I'm leaning towards number three as a as a starting point um but what do you guys think kegy likes the middle one okay and like I said we're not the in the intention isn't to just Design This House it's not just to take this we're going to lay out uh initial massing based on this first render and then we're going to tell it to like help us come up with more ideas all right so we got a couple people already coming in for got two twos a one and a three one you guys are going back to one oh man oh you guys are doing that because I said I didn't like it didn't you that's the thing that's you're ruining the pole there the moment that you mention your own your own desires it's going to automatically push it to that direction all right so we'll give it uh a few seconds one and one and two are tired oh one's back ahead two one it's going back and forth between one and two three's got like two votes yeah Sven I agree Sven I'm I'm thinking like I guess retro is a thing so uh whoa two just pull ahead there oh I wonder if we should set a timer for voting but all right um next next vote we're going to do polls I'm gonna throw po three came out I I'll be honest at this point I've lost lost track I'm going with two two had the most votes at one point so I'm going to do this so I'm going to say add a scene for this and we're going to come out here so when it adds a scene I get this image down here I I'm not going to do much with this other than having this scene be you know like the first uh scenes right here what happened oops sent my window behind there what's going on something's on a different uh a thing just happened my diffusion window went or maybe I can just opened diffusion back up maybe I can't do anything at all um I just had a thing happen I don't know what to to do I'm take a picture of this real quick and then not going to spend any more time trying to fix it which is a thing I do all right so again we're just uh all right well I guess we're starting over cuz uh a thing just happened what that thing was stream today's great however while you figure that out I did add the photo um in the uh Forum um and also this is for SketchUp employees it's now a reaction Emoji inside our own internal chest so it's very good I can feel that yeah no I don't know is anybody on the stream does anybody on the stream make it to AIA did anybody come by and say hi to us uh while we were there I was there I said hello to you that is true so this right here is showing uh what happens whoops what happens with AI so this is why we've had some people refer to SketchUp diffusion as a rendering option yeah kind of you can I would call it a visualization tool over rendering I put the exact same prompt into diffusion and here's what I got this time one I got a pool um and I got two very diff looking houses so the randomness the chaos is in there where it's going to give you something different each time so uh yeah that's fun that's that's pretty neat I was just curious about what it would give me and apparently it gave me this so um I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to import actually let's uh well yeah I'm going to import this image I just made made oops I want to import as a match photo so we can just save it as a scene import that scenes I am going to rename this uh um call Mark one Iron Man style okay so this was the first thing it gave me um oh I got I got the little teddy outline in the image right next to thing okay so when I look at this um got more or less a rectangle looks like it's stepping back in for the entry right here so we got little bit of an L kind of thing going on um I'm going to start with that geometry so I'm going to come over here put in something like uh something like that and then back this way oh man come on all right jeez again we go 15 foot comma 22 foot killing me man all right and then that's the front of the house yeah I'll probably to this out further I don't know I'm just at this point I'm just making shapes I don't even have a plan for where rooms are going to be or anything like that so uh that's nice Aaron can you turn on your key logger is that oh I can I can I do I can that I can do I know exactly how to do that um maybe where'd it go just kidding all right boom all right yes see I can do a thing all right so just like curiosity 3600 square feet awesome all right I'm going to take that pull that up like 10 foot I am going to remove Teddy I don't like the way that diffusion always renders her um I'm also got to do something about this crazy like got a fairly extreme uh field of view here that I don't care for so I'm going to go to camera which is which is it's only because the way I did the uh imported that image as a match photo but let's go here to field of view set it back to like 35 all right that's that's more normaler okay for the roof um trying to think what to do for the roof I'm going to grab this right now make it a group uh maybe I'll grab just this piece come out here edit paste in place do something like do that being one roof do this as another grab that make it a group Gra that make it a group that make it a group and then I'll do something like come in here offset this 24 I just want to put an initial uh an initial roof on here that I can work from if that makes sense uh that will go up like um there same thing here so all I'm doing is I'm taking this rectangle offsetting it 24 in um getting rid of that inside line then I don't need that anymore and then I'm pulling this up what do I do 18 in then uh cool okay and then uh the same thing here again just to get me some initial geometry to to to throw back at Fusion oh yeah what about this what about that bad attitude you you tell that rof who's boss that's right so this one I'm just going to bring up a little right something like that okay that worked um then to get I'm going to come into this I'm going to grab this line I'm going move it straight up here good this off here this is some some messy modeling but uh again we're conceptually massing right now so there's what that part would look like over here just instead of pulling that line up I'll just come up like this drop down here this [Music] one all the way up to come over like that back here like thiss I missed my point NOP did it again sell down clicky probably need some more coffee that's probably a problem um awesome and this is go over to here I missed I missed a thing there we go cool um this is going to be a little weird I'm on top of one there we go that was easy enough not weird at all totally normal totally easy I think that has it closed up almost do we hear did anybody did anybody on the chat make it to AIA do we hear that I didn't see anybody I know I I chatted with a few people who you know were reaching out over social media but I think um I'm not seeing in the the chat anybody who joined us there were a lot of a lot of people there but what was your favorite part of AIA going out there you know it was cool to go to Washington DC that's where it was this year anybody's not aware um and that was fun it was it's always it's a cool place to go to get to go um is this not straight straight um what the heck is going on here um I usually have the same response to that question um I almost always my favorite part of going to any trade show is getting to hang out with people and talk to real humans because that's that's what I enjoy doing that's it's nice to you know there's not a dig there not not not this not awesome to hang out with you guys virtually but it's uh it's cool when we get to do it in real life yeah there was funny how many times people were like oh my gosh is that the SketchUp guy constantly the entire trip was just like you're you're a famous you're a famous person my friend in very very select circles Big Deal what am I doing what am I even why is this mess just not closing up what am I doing that's not even that's not even close to being on the roof we're getting there oh my gosh are we are we get where we want to go I don't know what okay I'm a hyper positive person almost to a toxic level sometimes I'm just here to Hype you up I'll take it all right anyhow okay there we go wow all right so this this Mass needs to be clean who whoops you think delete I erased some things okay so anyhow less than 10 minutes I mean something guess I okay so now now we got that we got that initial massing in there um I like the way that turned out you guys is everybody okay with that any May hate it a it I think it looks nice um Randy Randy says Randy Randy came in a little bit late and asks if you can please start over from scratch I think Randy knows the answer to that request all right so I want to get a uh a decent angle on this something so I was I was you know the angle that it gave was very straight on and uh that's cool that's just AI being Ai and reassuring all designers that they don't have to worry um but to give it some geometry to help me design this and make this house a little more interesting I want to give it a little more you know little more extreme not extreme more interesting view so I'm going to come over like this uh and I'm going to take this view back into diffusion so oh you know what I should do first I don't see it in the chat but I'm going to do it anyways there we go all right kegy got it all right so I'm going to take this take it from this this point of view actually tip it down a little bit so we get some uh we don't have a sky where's our sky Styles oh let's turn on Ambi occlusion fancy I okay so here's the thing we went like we said we went to AIA we got to talk to a bunch of people it's amazing how many people we go to these things and they they haven't used new versions they have I'm on 22 still um which just fine there's nothing wrong with that but it was it was interesting because we spent so much time talking about here's what's new and we show these things over and over again to go show somebody diffusion they or well diffusion and ambient occlusion they had never seen it before it was kind of fun to go okay it's not just me it's not just that I'm simple and a little bit of shadow makes me go wow other people felt that way too so uh yeah thank you for anybody who went oo and I clicked that on thank you Charles yeah no problem I'll whenever you turn it off and on I will go oo all right so we'll save that and then we will make that a scene uh and then we will hop back into the fusion all right so in diffusion diffusion is still going to show me exactly it's going to be exactly where I left it diffusion doesn't automatically update or anything like that it just sits there and waits for me so I'm going to say refresh because I want to generate something off of this view not the render I had before um now we're going to come in here and I'm going to drop my prompt influence down a little bit I'm going to bring my respect geometry way up um so usually I think default is around here maybe I forget uh but I'm going to take this like a one we're going to do one and 10 all right so now we want to get into a little bit more detail what do we want to do here so we don't have to tell like what size it is or that it's a a family home anymore now we can start doing some stuff like get in a little more specifics so let's see I'm not going to do anything other than just say give me a mid-century modern ranch style home I'm just going to do that and hit generate and see what happens on top of that um I'm doing that right now what you guys should do is type give me the prompt that you think I should put in there while this renders this is this is how we'll kill time this is this is how we'll make up for the the the lag between uh what I'm saying and when you're hearing it tell me how I should do what should I ask it for this was mine but I want a better prompt you guys knew better than this so here's what we got so far okay I'm not going to say anything yep why is this if we don't get any responses I'm gonna go with Barbie Dreamhouse Barbie Dreamhouse um all right so obviously we need to give a little more information here um this is an interesting look I just wanted to touch on this um I I mean I like the look of solid black or dark gray against wood I think that that those colors look really cool um so I kind of like how we have this s this horizontal siding black siding or dark siding here and then vertical wood siding I think this is a cool look um I'm not really sure about this white trim around the black sides on the roof that that looks a little uh I don't know it looks a little looks a little AI to me um we do have a couple points that are coming in yes this is probably where we throw in Windows I'm still thinking geometry and L finish here um so I think we do want to say you know like yeah uh lots of windows I don't know why this one this one looks like a hot tub sitting in a factory or something like that um it looks like we've got concrete around here and then we got this metal thing behind I don't know how it got out this at all did you see Eric's comment about it looking like a swimming pool yeah great minds yeah this thing I don't this is not doing it for me um this thing's okay we got a nice combination brick accent here that's kind of neat um but then uh yeah no other doors or Windows um so yeah this one's winning so far but none of these got me Blown Away enough that I want to run with it so let's uh let's add some more things um yes yeah um yeah Randy's picking up this put in 70 style paning I don't know if that's what it's interpreting when I'm saying midcentury modern uh if that means 70s Exteriors um how do you guys feel about skylights I love a good Skylight trying something to put in for this entry way metal yes I lots of lots of awesome finish ideas um what do I want to say about the front door like I feel like I want the door to uh oh yeah there we go I'm going to say with side lights s lights they called the little doors next to the thingies yeah all right I'm run with this this see what you guys feel free to throw more things in Oops I did not refresh that I want to go back to this and then I want to generate that somebody asked if Aman occlusion affects the render right now with this version that we have that I'm running right now um it does not it does not make any difference uh M it doesn't it sort of disregards materials so regardless what materials I put on my model it's going to render the geometry and not the materials that's one of the things that we heard from you guys through the Forum and and through uh lab's feedback was that we needed to be had the ability to kind of reference and hold on to uh the materials more and because right now it does not do that all right so we got some options um I'll buzz through this row real quick this is the one I accidentally rendered rather than resettings the materials I rendered off of this so these are variations of that so we got a couple went looks like a a storage shed or something I don't like that this is cooler I don't love the materials but uh I like how they we ended up with lights up in this overhead roof that's kind of neat we got the door back here that makes sense nope don't like that at all moving on okay don't like that either o look this to all light All Glass up top okay okay I like that the best so what it did what it tried to do so it is still AI so at the end of the day you there's still possibly some interpreting that has to happen but I can see what it kind of did was it it gave me this glass wall around the outside that's cool I do like that um very much I like that and it kind of pushed this entry further in so this roof covers this rather than having another section coming off to cover uh it kind of pushed the entry and I think that's kind of cool I think I want to play with that and I like the lights up here um so I'm going to I'm going to take this one and add that as a new scene so this is cool so before we did uh we imported a scene into an empty model and we got exactly what we asked for which is you know this that doesn't help much of course um but now when we import uh a diffusion render right on top of the model it gives us more of that match photo look so we can actually look at it and go okay this is yeah this is what it's uh how it's supposed to line up so I want to in this case I'm just going to start Mark mocking out where some geometry is at um I like I like the windows up here I don't really to do much to mark that up I'm going to come here come across try to come across even Dimensions so I'm going to say like 12 foot6 and then I'm going to take that line all the way up I'm have to rotate but all right like that and then hop back in this I should rename that scene again so apparently it it comes up with some number re some number in time that 1240 yeah this is the time that I ran it oh this is this probably date 2024 0614 so that's the name of the scene it creates that doesn't do much for me so I'm just going to call this Mark 2 take that all right so now I'm gonna come in here and come over go to right about there yeah they 12 fo6 I'll run that up and then I will oops I'll push that back Oops I did that out out of context oh this is your first time using SketchUp pal grab these two lines cut them come into context edit paste in place and I can take this and push this back so looks like it came in with about four so I'm going say like 5 foot deep that'll be my entry over here then let's do this let's offset this glass 4 in and I'm going grab this bottom section raise that that up a little bit like another 6 in and that will be our glass panel we'll do the same thing over here um I'll come across like this how far was that okay we say 16 foot so I'm not rather than just arbitrarily clicking I'm trying to come up with nice round Dimensions where I can um did it again at least I'm consistent um but I'm setting some records today what just happened there okay diffusion window go all right uh yeah stuff happening all right let's try again offset go in here offset and then we brought this one up all right there we go and then just cuz you give me glass I'm just going to going to come in here and I'm going to push these in I don't know like an inch give me that that relief I'm going do the same thing up here too while while I'm here I'm going to this line up there so I have this surface we go offset six in Randy says in the chat um that they tried using a famous song lyrics As the text prompt for an image with diffusion get you some really interesting results you should post that in the Forum under this because I would love to see what that that created there absolutely please please do all right it's it's coming along I I like the look at this um kind of cool um uh let's hop back over here what what other pieces do we like I like this little side window over here I'll probably grab that not crazy about this this looks like a shed that got bolted to the side so I'm not going to do that so I'm going to actually just kind of model this window I'm not gonna um I just did that with realistic Dimensions because so this so this is like a standard height it's like s foot something for this top of this window uh so if you look at this look at it compared to this that looks great but the fact is that wall is like 16 feet tall so we have this window that's going up super high and not only that it's like 5T to the bottom of the window so there's some situations that might make make sense and I could probably make this taller because I have that big wall so I could take this and like bring it up a little bit higher like another 24 in so you know a tall window um but I probably don't want to uh yeah put it all the way up where it was oh Matt's here and leaving that's Matt has Matt Matt shouldn't be commenting today yeah get out of here seriously no no working no worky um cool all right I like that um I think the other thing I'm going to do real quick where is it we're 45 minutes in we got a pretty good I me we got a pretty good conceptual modile right now um I'm going to clean up some of these lines because AI I said it looks at geometry so it's kind of funny because we always tell people don't worry about lines edges uh if you're rendering or something because they won't get they won't be seen uh but diffusion sees them so you guys notied in some of my diffusion uh drawings it had like Brakes in the roof here because I had those lines there um so yeah I'm going to come in and just kind of come up with an aesthetic for what these windows are look like I trying to match like something like this so um one of the things that I have found see if you guys feel this have seen this too I have seen that a lot of uh when diffusion does repetitive items they're very very rarely evenly spaced so even like look at this window right here these are three very different size panes right here um up here we have three different sizes right across here I have this one this one's bigger this one's smaller this one kind of doesn't exist so I don't know if you guys have seen that but uh that's a thing that I've noticed a lot with with uh AI generating this geometry um no nothing bad about it I'm just saying like as I go in if I'm going to try to generate this to make this like a re looking house I'd probably come in and make sure that I evenly break those pieces um so I'm going to I'm going to give this a little more oh I can't do that because yeah that makes sense so I'm GNA thinking this is going to be a real wall and the window's going to come off of it means I'll have to run something up like this here and then maybe take this and is this all the same height no that's sloping okay so I'm going to come in here and maybe find the middle of this line drop a line there as reference in the middle here somebody was talking about uh how Matt used guides in his modeling and how I never do that and I just got to say that is true I don't do that um yeah I don't it's just a thing I've never really been good at I just don't use guides ever that thinks he's so cool with his guy I don't know if you see in the chat they're wondering about your shirt escy um where are you escaping from jail the Asylum uh so let me explain what I'm doing and then I will tell that story so um I just made a rectangle here it's going to be kind of my division piece it's just a a half inch by 4 in but I'm going to take it option copy that down put it right here let going say 2x give me one there and then I can take each of these individual pieces and run them up through the top there uh yeah you guys have probably seen if you follow us on YouTube you have probably seen that we occasionally do these videos we call built-in SketchUp where we travel to customer sites we see how they are using SketchUp and then we make a video about it uh a few years ago this actually one of our first ones uh was we went to a company called The Escape game and it is an awesome company that makes Escape rooms and they use SketchUp to do so so uh one of the perks of doing that particular job was Matt and I where Matt and I was were the ones uh making the video were able to do a couple of Escape rooms and at the end they gave us a free t-shirt and I liked this one cuz it just simple understated just says Escape e and it makes people ask yeah all right so there we go I like that's that's coming along nicely um I wonder if I should match that same kind of finish here but all right I'm thinking I'm thinking it's time for another round of uh what would diffusion do um so yeah let's go ahead and I'm going to just bump that ever so slightly get a fresh scene saved actually we can jump right back to this scene going to go back to my scene two I'm going to actually rename that too let's call let's go into scenes and let's name this uh diffusion this not a word but that's what it's going to be I'm take that yeah we'll leave right there all right so let's take this in and uh let's let's add some more stuff um I want to have diffusion help me figure out what my front door Situation's going to be like um maybe this should be a garage on the left maybe we could put this cool garage door on here somewhere um yeah let's try that let's let's try those things bring the fusion window back over all right so um I don't know if I should keep keep going with the same prompts excuse me I've been using or if we should come up with something new what do you guys think what do you what do you want to I'm going to do something while you're coming up with that tell me what to like I said the things that I'm trying to think through is what what could we do for the front entryway well could we do a garage over on the left what would a prompt for that look like uh and while you're doing that I'm just going to go ahead exterior photo realistic and I'm just going to do a fun just for fun render while you guys throw some uh some things in here so Keg's recommending we just get rid of mid century drop that right out of our context all or all of design that sounds great to me I'm good with that um yeah probably time to save so just looking at o that's kind of cool coming up with some different different finish looks um this is so one of the things we were talking about is how uh how much respect does it have for geometry unfortunately the way diffusion works now I don't have a way to tell it that this surface is is a window um so this one got it it went oh that must be glass uh and I actually kind of like the entry it did um but uh the rest of these it turned it into paneling which is okay this is this is the generative design process um but that was just taking the geometry and doing the exterior photo realism prompts added in there so um yeah what do you guys I kind of like that I don't if you guys noticed that that's hard to can't see anything there uh but the entry it pushed it back even a little bit further looks like and then uh did my entry actually my entry might be going this way on this one that's kind of cool um yeah so if there's any other terms you guys think would be fun to put in here but uh get away from mid-century that's fine actually I can I remove gotta go no style there we go I got no style folks well at least you say it you know I can say it yeah actually I mean Charles just want to give you permission you can say it too um I don't know if you've any watched any of our streams with Jody but he would have already caught me on that one by now but so he he helped me develop thick skin all right so we're going to say I'm just going to say contemporary temporary I did that right uh house with garage with hold let's give more detail we can do I don't know deep set front door in the middle [Music] and [Music] windows around the front side let's see what that does um this may have SE we did I did a video earlier floor height Windows there we go that was the term big window um we did a a video talking about the things to consider when writing a prompt and it does become sort of an iterative process where you add a little bit more each time um I didn't I kind of just ignored oh you know what I did I actually generated it off of this one we got these these items oh so look where it stuck the garage stuck the garage right there that seems like it be a tight garage ooh see that's what I was looking for I like that we got a different material on the front door that's got that side light and then the front door itself I like that's what I'm I'm going to do that um yeah it just kind of said no other than this one no you can't have a garage I don't like that um I like this I like the way that turned oh no you know what it gave me something there's a little break in the panel here I if you guys can see that can you see that on the stream it looks like it just a just a whisper of a garage door interesting yeah um I'm taking that as a sign of where I should put the garage that's what I'm um we're getting closer yeah I'm I'm GNA I'm going to take this one core Corton steel front door I don't know what that is it's s sounds cool old Corton Corton on the front door all right so I'm going to take that and I'm going to design off this a little bit so to start with I'm going to come over here uh I'm going to draw a line up yeah we'll make it a nice tall garage door CU maybe maybe I can back my uh camper in here or something like that so we're going to say 9 foot tall how wide is this oo it's a 30t so we could put how do I want to do this [Music] um so normally like an 8ot Grouch single 16's a double um maybe we'll do something like oh what about this I like this I I just had an idea all right so I'm going to come this way say 16t garage door plus a little space on either side so we'll come over like uh 20 foot that so that it's kind of funny like I saying the the the reference the this size becomes uh's that back in like so I that if that's my garage door that's a huge garage door that's 16 ft you can see that uh yeah it doesn't always cool all right so I'm go to scenes I'm I forgot to name my new [Music] scene I also forgot to do something with people just just just yelling at me to save with good reason of course there's there's a reason that's being yelled um cool so that looks good and this is the other thing I want to get in here I love this this is this looks so cool so I'm going to offset this like two in over three foot over three foot enter I hit three foot shift that does nothing and then I'm going to take that all no you know what I'm going to drop this a little bit um I'm put may put sky lights over top so maybe we'll come up like and then take that across like that that point that awesome all right how I I want to put one on either side three foot I see I want see if that works that up if I put that same divider size over here that leaves me with 5' 10 that's weird that's a weird size for a door um that's a really that's a really wide door it could be like doubles yeah that's kind of thing I could I could maybe get rid put light on one side and not the other what do you think chat how could I do this um I don't think symmetric is going to work French doors yeah I kind of if I did this right and something like that where this is 7 foot so I can make that two doors I see I see comments are coming in but I'm ignoring them in a polite way so this is glass and these are the two doors um I might like without anything else above it that was kind ofc I could have some I could have some I could have some can lights or something over top there that might look kind of cool an ambian occlusion I just I'm sorry I geeked out on Ambi inclusion there pulled my shadow outus let's get some oo in the chat oo all right so let's jump back okay kind of like that that's kind of fun um not a lot of detail on the door yet um I don't know I'm I'm struggling a little bit I don't kind of wonder if I should throw out uh the side light I like the idea of a sidelight but now that I'm looking at it maybe just a door with some decent Siz windows in it or something um kind of match what we got going on here see what you guys think of this I pull this in oops just mirror that duh we had a you know when when I was growing up we had it was a single door it wasn't um the the the double doors here but we had that that window to the side it was like a full window pane and uh my mom got super super into stained glass at the time so she ripped out all of that glass and put this really beautiful stained glass in in its place which fell apart after a couple years it didn't stay very well it wasn't built very well but uh yeah looks better yeah so this may be accent wonder if it's on the right side or not I think so well because what I was thinking is here here's here's my two thoughts um I was I was going somewhere with this because then if I do that maybe I'd pull this back out and just let that be a panel maybe my house number goes there maybe I don't know something like that but then I feel like I need to put this back in the center so am I thinking too much should diffusion be making these decisions for me just grab this back wall when I did that I mean that's the whole point of this uh the stream is using AI however you can't rely entirely on AI you also have to make these like creative decisions yourself because sometimes it's not going to work out that is true that's very very true plus uh I want to do stuff but I do agree we should put it right in the center yeah that looks better right all right I like the way this is coming across um yeah I agree Randy Randy's saying that uh you know Amin occlusion uh gives that imperfect uh light shadowing that that's just it makes it look so much deeper um cool so we go back to our diffusion list prompt all right looks pretty good actually kind of starting to look a little hectic so maybe we do need to go back to no windows I don't know um garage door where we at we're at hour in so I guess the question now is what else do we want to do with this on the outside um I'm not going to worry about the backside right now either um I guess we could we could we could mess with the backside um I'm kind of thinking like what other cool stuff could we do because one of the things I was thinking about would be like uh the block on the left is the garage there's not much the room left for well I mean this is the garage I think it's a pretty big building yeah we don't the garage doesn't have to go back super deep right what is this 30 ft deep so we could in theory this could come out further add another 12 feet here there we go I I got I got us some more space for our family you're welcome family oops oh boy all right have to come back after the fact and jeez booked me it's terrible it's a mess let's get this real quick quick a quick clean up I don't even know what's happening here can I can I just throw a rectangle so this is uh know potentially one of the issues uh with throwing together preliminary geometries you might make a disgusting gross mess uh but fortunately you stayed fairly straight with the lines uh it's not too hard to clean up so that that wasn't too bad that wasn't bad at all um something's not straight there this confuses me fine I'll leave you for right now whoops whoops whoops whoops cool um um yeah all right enough thinking more modeling uh cool so I sometimes I just feel like I got to clean things you know just a little bit of cleaning um all right so we're back to here maybe we do a quick run at the backside uh call this and we swing around here make a new scene call this one save that and take that into diffusion now and ask it to um back side of modern house with sliding GL door large concrete patio uh what else we want up back um y pool has been kind of a a general theme it seems to throw on Pools by itself so I don't even have to try just like yeah here's a pool um yeah we throw it in there I want I don't want to mess with modeling the exterior or the the landscape too much because I figure that'll be a second uh effort but uh yeah we'll at least get a hot tub all people are already excited about that Eric if you're still watching next week uh you might have to take this same model in and just uh develop a beautiful exterior with a pool hot tub fire pit sauna uh Etc oh that's kind of cool we're carrying around that uh that full height glass windows on the other side what wait I don't even know what I'm looking at here what the like just a shed I got a weird like almost fisheye thing and then it's like a mini house in the backyard of a different bigger house I'm say no to that one um yeah so it took the large patio to the N degree I don't really like any of these I mean I I it's this one's okay uh I mean it's putting the large slider right here that's cool um this is bringing that that wraparound glass which we already have that coming here and I kind of feel like we need some something solid around here maybe we could put another section there yeah that's a huge if it's just one big window that's a huge sun room yeah exactly we need need something solid we got we got to put you know kitchen somewhere we can I guess we' all be an island but yeah I'm not I'm not liking any of these uh so I'm G to I'm going to edit my prompt a little bit so I'm going to Let's actually first thing I do is get back to back to my my model so reset that back um large patio take out concrete see if that has any difference down there um multiple smaller Windows maybe mention that this is like the back of a building too I put back maybe maybe backside versus yeah just back let's see if that helps all right we'll run it we'll see what happens uh oh rapael put his suggested prompt up in Spanish as of right now uh the stable diffusion engine we use uh works best with English I've heard mixed results on on other languages but I know it works in English and uh not quite as well with others lot of Windows smaller well it's small on your screen right okay we finally have a pool folks that's right and uh large sink over here all right so there's a couple things I like here um I like that we got a we got multiple Heights right here so we have this this steps up that's kind of cool I hadn't thought about that um it's it's playing with perspective here and uh this step that I got right here it's actually showing it like there's it's higher up and further back so that's kind of interesting um yeah I kind of like granted this is this is primarily garage so it wouldn't make sense but I do like the idea of May maybe we have a doorway here maybe this back of the garage is I don't know a changing room something like that um yeah this is some some cool stuff uh uh color of the year I think it's saying say model um yeah that was one thing we were talking about earlier is uh the change that we want to make is to have it honor the the colors but we don't uh not there yet okay so I'm kind of feeling here's here's what I'm feeling is uh oh man do we just go with a whole what do you guys think should we just do a whole the whole back wall glass like this it leads out into like a patio that would be like a nice like dining room room yeah leing out to a patio that would make sense maybe yeah maybe we do have like just an an access door off the back right here and then a big slider SL glass wall here um yeah um I'm not gonna I'm not going to model four pools right now uh yes it is a lot of pools um but let's come in here let's grab this and we'll do we'll do uh let's go how tall is 7 foot so that's for reference uh this would be a 7t by 6t slider just just just as a an idea of what that geometry would look like out there so that whole glass wall might be might be a lot um maybe we do a chunk of it what I'm thinking is okay so we're going to I'm going to take this one well this is kind of this is actually more kind of what I'm thinking what if we just do this section back here I'm G to grab this one for right now whoops let's go back to the back there we go and now hop back over diffusion oh no I hit reset I hit the button again so when you hit when you hit the diffusion button it calls all over again so I lost my little render there um oh so back of modern home with a [Music] large double sliding glass door like you guys need me to read this like the words aren't just showing up right in your face it's like that's I have my own subtitles um and a large Pao with a hot tub and multiple smaller Windows WS Windows throughout all right I'll try that again um yeah so right now just as a reminder we do have our settings set to you know really respect our geometry as we go if we did want to do something like what would this look like with a adjustments to the actual geometry we could we could do that um whoa this is interesting it made it into a second floor on a on a on a bond villain house out over the water that's kind of cool that's a choice yeah we're not going to do that but that's kind of neat all right see this is more what I was thinking of this was actually more in line with what I had in my head um so in this one we again probably wouldn't put the glass around the back of the garage so much maybe a door maybe an access door uh nice reasonable size slider and a little another spot where the glass is open that's kind of cool um yeah similar thing here but I'm I'm I'm feeling this a little more this feels like it's kind of in line with what the front of our house is uh which is something else I want to do um yeah I'm taking this one adding it slide diffusion over and not close it because I learn from my mistakes and also have you saved in a minute I some times learn from my mistakes whoa that's kind of oh no it lined up it lined I was like wow it lined up with where I put that well lined up with where I put that because I had you put it there yeah okay um all right so I'm going to do a couple things here let's go let's pull this over how far over is this all right so I'm say I'm going to come over 4 foot and then we'll do another another glass wall here oops 4 foot over that up like that this will be our slider right here push that in that'll go for 4 in in and this push two in in give me that uh conceptual geometry look of that and then over here what do we got this a six all right so I'm grab this this six inches as well I think on the corners here I did a little closer is that six 4 Ines okay so I'm going to match that going to match how that looks I'll take this over another 2 in and then since this one's sloping I can't do that got to draw the line say 2 in and then how far in did I push these glass CH I think that's an inch in okay here P that in one that in one all right so it's kind of it's kind of coming together it looks lonely with just this door right here I do feel like I need to put another window or something um might do it just a teeny bit more detail in here too I might just take this and offset this like these bottom Pieces Just a Touch back in probably need to pull over here cool I like modeling with ambient occlusion on that is it feels good there we go now looks like have true slider it looks so good too like I just like that all right um I think what I had here was I said a door over here or a window over here um I'm going to actually pull it like for one thing I want to make it uh you know same height and then I'm going to pull a little bit closer so maybe we'll come over here what this be like I know I'm doing this I'm doing this kind of ridiculous thing right now where uh I'm designing the outside of the house without any real care or intention what's actually going on inside the house so we're doing this probably pretty backwards of how you should actually do this um but uh yeah that's a thing that's happening and I really can't stop it at this point all right so that gives us another window right there something kind of cool I do want to put I said I don't know if this would be the garage or maybe a mud room or something something but I'm going to put in just a regular just like a uh regular uh exteror exterior door right here I'll just push in like that so um all right that's kind of cool that's looking cool not sure if I should mess with putting more stuff over here um maybe like a window I mean if there's like bedrooms or something like that you'll probably want some natural light there but yeah probably not again not more full height stuff maybe like in this corner you know what I'll do I'll I'll copy this geometry right here I'm G to go directly below that option copy that bring that over here just going for a look I don't know I don't if it like that actually this is where I should be leveraging AI right all right let's go back here and uh take that after I save of course obviously we'll take that geometry and and then uh just going to kind of grab back the modern home with multiple small slam Slammer smaller windows on the left side and what else we need to add here here o we should probably put a fireplace or something right yeah just for fun I'm going to ask it to Billow smoke see what happens yeah Johnny I know I know I was I was uh we're still conceptual modeling worst case worst worst possible case I've spent an hour and a okay Bill smoke was not that wasn't what I was going for I was that's terrible uh not it well I mean if we need start a design over this is one way to do it we're heading into forest fire season here in Colorado too so uh this is not not in good taste come on diffusion [Laughter] top of a top of a volcano okay I asked for billowing smoke this one's on me um this is on you all right so obviously this is not the one but I did like the simple window we got over here um all right so I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm GNA make a change with a chimney um and modern looking chimney and I'm going to come in here to my settings I'm going to reset back to here try again I'm going to say I'm less concerned about the prompt and or less concerned about the geometry and I want to give more weight to The Prompt um because I don't think it's going to add a chimney if I have like my respect my geometry all the way up like that so I'm going to try this again going back to original um no more billowing [Laughter] smoke I used AI to model a house fire that's not a selling point that's a great that's a great YouTube title right there all right let's see all right so it's getting so it is it is getting a little little loose with the geometry because of that um yeah I think we I think you're right keggy Keg's point out we probably to tell where to put the chimney on the roof roof let's try that so I've noticed this I don't know if you guys picked this up as it did that as it created those other things it it's still kind of respected where geometry was but it almost what what I find it does when I get down to here like 0. five um it's almost like it takes the geometry lays it flat and then reinterprets the depth so just to jump back sorry we're talking so this this piece right here see how that piece kind of comes out and I got this weird I don't know it's just an accent it's not really real anymore uh if I look at that versus this look what it did it did it took this geometry I had and made it that um same thing with these roofs so the geometry of the roof that the outline the overall outline of where that's at is pretty much the same but inside that outline it just kind of shifted where the planes were it's just not a not a big thing but kind of interesting to see how it does that how it interprets those things whereas if I turn it up more it definitely models inside the geometry uh it respects a little bit better okay so this gave me another another kind of walk out area over there it is holding on to my holding on to my glass oh see that might be more kind of like kind of like that yeah and here it just gave it a whole second floor that's how it works um okay so go with that um it's not coming up with a good spot to stick a chimney so I think I'm going to put my own chimney in I'm going to we're coming up on an hour and a half so I gota I gotta start start winding towards a conclusion got to start wrapping it up that's right so this was Mark five and from Mark five I am going to take this set of Windows over here so I'm going to come in here go into context go come over three foot three foot up I'm going to come up actually let's let's do this let's go up to the same height as these windows over 12 foot drop that back down nice multi- panel window there um and I'm thinking I don't know what this look like but what if we stuck a chimney right here what if I did that how's that going to look from the front oh yes it's a little high what got to be three foot above the eve wider I like that um yeah I wasn't sure how that would look from the front but that looks okay back there kind of forces this into be a family room which makes sense with the slider coming out on the back uh yeah all right I'm going to do one last back render right here and see uh what it makes of my my new chimney and I'll do one more from the front so reset that and now we're just going to go I'm going to do a couple things I'm going to turn on my photo real style exterior photo real um modern ranch home with put this back up to you um I don't know I'm trying to think materials at this point with uh wood and dark gray finish Stone chimney and the sunset reflecting in the multiple windows give it a shot big money big money big money so here's some things I'll Muse on as as we we we do this um I think obviously like I said we were working outside in which is not ideal but I could see something like this working on if I had gone in and had you know did something a little more realistic like did a layout of the floor like here's the kitchen I got got the shape of my house first I still could have done that and then taken that initial exterior massing and then had to do this because I could still go okay yeah those windows will work with where I have this room uh the front door that's about where the entry is going to be that would work so this would still work on the outside I know this was just kind of for fun uh jumped in but you could still do that you could still take that that preliminary massing which is the step that we kind of skipped of how many rooms are going to be in here where they to be laid out I could still do that and come into this this way this would still work oh that's pretty cool like that that's it did the same thing again or maybe that's the same height just have a little retaining wall there o this steps out to a pool I think Eric's gonna have to put a pool in here at some point I like that one that finish is kind of cool but unfortunately when I said Sunset reflecting in in the window um uh it made it dark so I'm going to do one more I'm going to say with the Sun and generate that whoops hold up there is no abandon there's no abandon uh my generation button uh not abandon My Generation I have turned my back on my generation but uh you know what I mean there's no stop so let's try this skin look at look at what it it came up with in the in the meantime that's a nice again it's amazing to think that what AI does is it takes the information it finds and the real images it finds and it does stuff I'm like but I look at this I'm like it's like a crosswalk I don't know got standard track home got like little bench over here that's kind of cool all right so here's what we came up with at the end kind of cool that's kind of neat it added stone in there I wasn't expecting that cool all right I'm going to save this one and then I'm going to swap call this one fin fine final rear and then we'll go back to the front and I'm going to run the exact same promp I'm not changing anything but I'm just going to flip it around so see this Sprint and then just run the exact same prompt I'm curious if I'm going to get a similar finish on the front as I had on the back with the same prompt Obviously good money's on no because of the randomness but uh yeah here we go I kind of like that that looks cool all right all right oh man this look good yeah I think I kind of like this one got rid of our half our windows so I'm not a not a fan of that um worked hard for those windows um actually this probably the most detailed part of the model but um yeah I think either of these I like how it kept the uh the kind of dark reddish wood on the front doors the front door I didn't really ask for that but uh kind of cool I'm turning aside what do you think chat one or three just trying to think of what I like better of the Finish let me know let me know your thoughts throw in the throw in the chat what do you think if uh number one here looks good or number three looks good I think one might be a little more cohesive but uh no we got got votes for three see I had to just shut up stop talking dude the second I say anything everybody's like yeah just whatever you didn't say yeah I I I'm I'm I think that's pretty cool all right I'm G I'm going to put three in there boom close down to Fusion I'm going to rename that to front final and uh yeah that looks pretty cool I mean considering considering we had no idea what we were modeling like at all other than a house um I would say the fact that we got here in like an hour and a half is pretty cool um like I don't think I would run with it I do kind of like so some stuff I do like I like the the wood on the garage door the vertical Uh Wood here the the wood treatment around the entry including the drop ceiling that looks cool I I don't know if I love this little chunk of that same kind of wood up here I think I'd rather see that match this but yeah man that was that's pretty cool I like the way it works um yeah uh cool yeah any other uh yeah so uh Drew is asking about AI yes this does use the webbased stable diffusion engine so that's why it does take a few seconds when we say generate this it does have to run out to the cloud uh put the prompt into the engine along with the geometry data get the images back and download them so that's why it takes a few seconds to do that but uh but yeah I think this turned out pretty sweet I I like this awesome well yeah um give you guys a couple seconds so any last comments or questions you might have into the chat while I say the following things so we are uh we may not be streaming next week we might be taking a by week just let yall know it's summertime we're being realistic about our schedules and we love being here with you guys you families yeah doing stuff so yeah so we we're probably not going to be streaming next week uh both uh Eric and I so Matt just streamed Eric and I are both Trav or both can potentially be away next Friday so possibly no stream next week uh more importantly though we are putting up the agenda the the actual content that you'll be able to see at 3D base camp this year so if you go to 3db camp. sketchup.com uh you'll be able to see the the content the actual classes that are going to be taught they're going up so check that out cuz if you've been thinking about maybe you want to go maybe you're not sure you want to see the content first now time to check out the content and uh maybe grab yourself a ticket cuz uh it's going to be good we've 100 plus classes I think have gone up at this point or close to that uh some awesome stuff got some you know all-time Heavy Hitters uh the guys who guys and gals who are there every year teaching their stuff
