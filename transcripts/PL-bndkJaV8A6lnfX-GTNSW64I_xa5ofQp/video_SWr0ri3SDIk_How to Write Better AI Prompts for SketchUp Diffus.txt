hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about how you go about making an amazing diffusion prompt inside of SketchUp so we're going to of course be looking at uh the diffusion extension that uses stable diffusion to create imagery from your model so some people use this as like a renderer kind of like to get realistic lighting and material and that kind of stuff on there some people use this as a idea generation tool like what what would happen if I took this shape and finished it in certain looks and feels um regardless of how you use it the prompt you put in is going to have a huge impact on what you actually see when you uh you know hit that stable diffusion button so let's go ahead and check out uh creating great prompts for diffusion for SketchUp all right so we're going to hop right in here I have a super simple model so this is a little little box uh it's not in a group or anything it's just literally this shape I have it kind of turn so The Horizon's right in the middle and I see the peak rising up above um that's it there's nothing nothing special to this at all so we're going to go ahead and uh click the diffusion button and I'm not going to mess with a lot of this stuff okay so I'm not going to play with Styles uh I'm not going to really mess with so I have a .9 respect model geometry and then a nine prompt influence which is the default I'm just going to leave it there I'm not going to mess with any of that stuff the only thing we're going to be playing with is right here uh the one thing I am doing I did create a scene so I created a scene of this this first uh where I'm at right now so if I ever want to jump back to this you know if I save different scenes in diffusion I can jump back to it pretty quick and easy but really other than that we're just going to look at this right here what do I type in here so we're going to start with simple right I'm going to say I want to make this a house in the country wow that was how many seconds in I already had a typo that's on brand let's go ahead and hit generate so of course this is just going to take the the the super simple prompt I just put in and it's going to create some images using stable the stable diffusion uh AI engine and we'll look at that um depending I mean how much time and energy want spend on a prompt is sort of up to you uh you can kind of make that call but so here's here's what I got right okay okay so none of these are bad I I wouldn't say you know if if I had no idea what to do with this shape this could be a start this could be something um but these are pretty far apart so if I was if I was doing like idea generation right so I don't know what I want to do with this thing I just want to just you know this might work out okay but I'm thinking I probably want to have a little more input than that so there's a couple spots that I want to look at at in detail the first one is about the structure itself um so like what kind of house is this I just said house right so this these are these are definitely could be called houses it gave me that but let's say I want to take that a little bit further right so we say uh country style home with a covered porch let's let's go ahead and generate that notice I am coming back to the base model too I don't want to expand upon these other ones I want to just try to get the perfect prompt to take my base geometry and make that into the image that I'm looking for so all I did here is so again rather than just saying a house um I added country style I added a covered porch and we're going to see how that changes what diffusion does for getting me my images all right so let's take a look at what this is okay so if I count that a porch and looks more like a front step um actually kind of like that that's kind of cool it pushed the entryway back in and kind of gave me a porch around the the front Okay so yeah so I got this kind of kind of moved an ins set and gave me some space inside so yeah we got some cool stuff I'm not really sure what's going on I got a couple sidewalks maybe my neighbors moving in right here and this is this is uh their their front entry um but okay so you can see I I got something uh coming along um I might go a little bit further um maybe like I'll say something like light blue country style home with a covered porch in the country so I'm not worried about this back part of the prompt yet so uh we're still in the country whatever that means but what I'm trying to do now is kind of develop out just those those first pieces so uh right now stable diffusion takes your geometry and it doesn't honor things like color textures or anything like that you put on there so I do want to if there's a specific look or color I want I want to make sure I put that in so the type the information specifics about the geometry you want and then also uh any colors you want you need to specify so we got that looks kind of like a shed all right see here we go now we're getting into to kind of the thing I want so you'll notice with all of these every one of these um they are really sticking to that shape I created so my porch when I do get a porch on here it's staying inside the geometry so I know I said wasn't going to end of this yet but the settings this is where I want to go okay maybe I can say let go loosen up a little bit on the geometry and maybe we'll bump up the influence so now we'll go back to the home and just making that little change we'll say generate that again this is going to depend on how much geometry you're actually working with right so if I had my whole house mapped out I could say really respect my geometry in this case I really have like a box so the fact that I want to maybe have a porch coming off of it means I'm going to change my in prompt influence a little higher and maybe my respect geometry a little bit lower so that still didn't do a whole lot let's try going just a little bit more so we'll just do again we'll drop down this little bit lower and reset and regenerate again this is going to depend on where you're at in the design process if you're coming in here and you have the Full House your architecturals are done everything's and I'm just trying to look for a finish or maybe landscape designs then I'm going to say yeah absolutely respect my geometry 100% at this point where I'd say I'm in the ideation phase I can drop that and you know let let the fusion go a little bit further with you know what is this going to look like with a oh that's kind of kind like that that's kind of nice um yeah so I'm I'm definitely getting there I might may even say you know maybe even a little bit more um I'm sorry I'm kind of having a little bit of fun right now so uh let's go ahead and run that one more time and then we'll we'll move on and continue fine-tuning this prompt so this is a big part of it changing your settings and like I said a big part of this is how locked in is your model are you in the idea are you flexible to making changes moving stuff around if so then I'm going to want to move my geometry higher and my prompt influence maybe has a little bit less uh impact that way okay so I'm getting some ideas here I want to I I I you probably notice as I click through here wide variety of what uh my surroundings on my my space look like so I'm going to maybe up level in the country um let's say uh with a beautiful not ugly but beautiful grassy yard and mountains in the distance all right so we'll revert back to original geometry hit generate and see what that gives us again we can put we can you know leave this up to uh diffusion to make these calls on on what something like in the country means or I can take this on my own and say okay yeah see now this is more what I'm looking for this is a better solution oh yeah like I like where this place is um that gives me more of the setting I'm looking for so uh I like where this is going um I'm going to take it a step further uh and I'm going to actually give it a little more setting so I got more information here about the house I want where it's at the surroundings but now I'm going to go a little bit further and I'm going to set the the time of day and season so I'm going to say at sunset um on a crisp fall day I don't know how it's going to show me crisp but I'm willing to test it let's hit generate uh yeah so again as I play with with diffusion more and more um I do find that there are certain terms that make more impact than others in those adjectives uh even in ones that are interpreted uh definitely make a big difference okay so yeah so see there we go I like that I like and I got fall so I got my fall colors back here in my trees in the background um I like this I think this is definitely getting closer to to what I want so um let's try let's try adding some terms to the covered porch to get that to pop out so I'm going to say a large covered porch and and then we'll just try regenerating that see if that adjective adding that to the thing I want is going to bump that out a little bit this is always fun because we're sending this out to AI to generate and interpret my information I can't really practice these videos so what I get back is is just as much a surprise to me as it is to you so um still not getting oh I got a porch here but it hit hit it hit it from me so um uh covered let's say front porch and then we'll regenerate this one more time and then we'll look at the difference in our prompts and the difference that prompts make as you're seeing here experimentation is is part of the process so I do have to kind of play with terms and see what works what doesn't and this is going to depend this is going to vary too depending on the types of work you do uh if you have terms that you find work regularly for you uh you might you know be able to use that um so oh yeah I like that so I'm going to add this as a scene real quick and then I'm going to go back to one of our first ones and then add that as a scene all right so now if we take a look here was our original model this was a house in the country and then this one was where we told it what kind of house what color we wanted what time of year what time of day and what was in the surroundings so you can kind of see I mean they don't look bad but there's a big difference between these two based on just those words that I chose to put in there and tell diffusion how to generate the image I was looking for so if first off let's let's go to if you haven't already used diffusion the extension you should check it out it's in SketchUp Labs means if you're a SketchUp user you can go grab and you can play with it you have to be a subscriber so you do have to have an active subscription but then you can get in there and you can actually try it out uh it I mean it's like all these AI generation I mean it is it's stable diff Fusion is an AI generation tool but it can take that geometry you have and give you some some cool options so this can be used like I said before maybe this is a design iteration thing try some different designs based on some words uh this could be landscaping ideas this could be you know try it out give it a shot but those are the things to think about as you go through and try to generate your prompt be specific about the structure itself colors matter because otherwise it's going to going to change that uh colors finish you know if you have a specific you know tile roof that kind of thing give it specifics about how that's supposed to look and geometry uh and then the surroundings are huge you know tell it exactly where you want to put it when you want to put it what the place in is you want to put it uh but but those are the kinds of steps you want to add add there uh you know it's possible too maybe you're just playing roulette and you just give me whatever you got that's cool too put fewer in but uh I have these are the these are the things this is the process that I go through to get the best possible uh renderings or the best possible images out of staple diffusion if you like that video click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you tried diffusion for SketchUp what do you think about it what do you think makes the ideal prompt to get the best image out and do you have any other ideas do you can you think of some things you think would make good videos we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
