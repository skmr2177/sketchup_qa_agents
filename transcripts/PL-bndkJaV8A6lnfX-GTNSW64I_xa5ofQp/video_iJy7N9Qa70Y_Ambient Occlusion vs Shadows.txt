hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at the differences between ambient occlusion and shadows and how you can use them together to get the best possible image in [Music] SketchUp so ambient occlusion is actually a newer feature as of this recording this is something that was released with the 2024 version of SketchUp um it well it makes ambient occlusion Shadows which are different from the direct Shadows that are created by the Shadows Tool uh so we're going to talk about how they're different how to use them and how to combine them to make the best possible image so let's take a look at that right now all right so I got a model here this model is uh a model we did on a couple live streams a few years ago um it's a cool model in that it's got a lot of nooks and crannies and really it's going to look good when we talk about am inclusion so the first thing before I even go in and flip on am occlusion or Shadows I want to look at just the surfaces so right now we have the standard camera so if I come here to Shadow and I drop this down used Sun for shading is turned off which means the only light in the screen is basically coming from the camera so where I'm looking at the model from so the faces that are most facing me this face right here this face right here are the most white of all the faces faces that are slightly away like these side faces get a little darker and then faces that are less facing towards the camera like the ground are getting even more darker so as I if I flip this around you can see see how this face light lightened up that was because of that default setting so that's I'm just saying that that's that's where we're operating from that's square one is uh no no sun for shading standard lighting uh with that let's go into our Styles and let's turn on ambient occlusion just going to flip it on and there we go it's I love it immediately you get a little more depth here right so any place face a face is hitting another face we get this little bounce Shadow uh right around that it's it's not has nothing to do with the light source it has nothing to do with uh the main Shadows it's all about those faces coming together and the little ambient Shadow that's created inside there so when we look at that uh we do have the ability to change like the distance how how far out is that going to run how how deep is that going to run um and then intensity is it really super deep I don't like I don't like going all the way on this one CU it's a little too dark a little too I don't know I don't like going all the way light obviously there so actually the default I feel really feels pretty good maybe intensify it a little bit little more distance so something to note about these sliders these are not relative to your geometry these are relative to the world so um something I want to note so I'm going to do this I'm going to grab this and I'm going to make a copy of it real quick just to illustrate this point and I'm going to scale that up by 10 all right so if I go back in here look at this you can see what my see what my Shadows look like my ambient occlusion Shadows just right here if I zoom out and then look back in on this one so the settings are exactly the same but you can see you can hardly even tell that there's ambient occlusion on little get a little shout right here the the issue is that these this distance and intensity is relative to like the normal size of the real world right so this is this is huge now this is 10 times the size of reality this is too big um so my Shadows no matter if I crank it all the way up crank it just crank it I still only get a light Shadow because the geometry is so big so it is an important Point make sure that when you're modeling you're modeling real size otherwise am occlusions can look weird same thing if I model too small if I model this as like you know a desktop Model A little teeny tiny thing when I turn on ambient occlusion I'm going to get these little I'm going to get these huge overwhelming Shadows because uh the Shadows are relative to the real world so I'm going delete that we'll go back we'll go back over here all right so that's ambient occlusion I'm going to turn ambient occlusion off and I'm going to turn on Shadows so I'm just going to turn on regular shadows and this is what a regular Shadow is so a shadow is telling me there's a sun somewhere up in the sky and it's casting light down and where it hits it gets this bright white and where it is uded it's going to add these Shadows so I just explain what shadow was hopefully you guys already had that down because you're you know human beings on the earth so it creates these Shadows um very different from the ambient inclusion ambient clusion has nothing to do with direct sun Shadows are only about that direct light so with this of course course I have the ability to change the time of day I can change the date which is going to change where the sun is in the sky pretty simple stuff um but I also have the ability to change my light and dark so this is something that's kind of overlooked I think uh I can make my light blazing white I can make my weight light uh you know subdued a little bit um and same with dark I can make my dark just oppressive or I can make it Disappear Completely so uh it is possible to get some some weird looking effects with this but uh yeah it's something you want might want to play with when you're when you're you know like I said if you're trying to get a a nice deep image you might want to play with I like to drop drop dark down really really I don't usually mess with light I usually kind of leave that where it is but then I'll drop my dark a little bit darker depending on you know how extreme I want that to be that looks pretty good the other thing I mentioned before use Sun for shading again we're still right right now that there's a secondary light source it's coming off the the camera so as I move around it's hard to tell with the Shadows but uh if I turn U Sun for shading on then the lightest face is the one facing the sun and the darkest face is going to be the one away from the Sun so that is something you might want to consider turning on um just to keep consistent look and feel so that's not going to change depending like if you move your camera this is going to say the only is on the sun if this is turned off then you have that light that's on the camera wherever you're viewing from as well all right so that looks pretty cool now here's here's this is what I like this is the part that I you know when you make a video like this you save the the the coolest part for the end so we're going to come in and we're to turn on Ami occlusion and shadows and I mean it looks good now Ami occlusion by itself look good but when you when you combine both of them it just gives that depth to the model where this doesn't look like just a static 3D model so I can turn toggle either of these on or off and either of them look good but both of them together look so much better it just looks so cool so here where I had this you know with just Shadows this is kind of a consistent color all the way through because the sun's not hitting this or this right so right here this is all the same all the same All the Same by turning on ambient occlusion I get that second level of shadow that bounce shadow that gives me the division between the pieces so um I'm a huge fan of this of being able to turn on both the ambient occlusion to give me that depth and then also give me these overlaying Shadows it just I don't know it just makes the model look like it has more depth it just it just looks deeper and better so something to note about this um with the new graphics engine in 2024 am occlusion is pretty fast so I could have ambian occlusion turned on on a larger model it'll perform pretty good Shadows still stutter a little bit if I start to get real big models so if I have a really large model I may want to turn Shadows off while I'm working and turn them back on when when I want to uh actually get my final output but uh yeah just something to note there's a difference in how it handles occlusion Shadows um so but yeah check that out try it out uh ambient occlusion and shadows they do work differently they do do different things but when you stack them up you get a pretty amazing looking image so there we go that is a just a snapshot of that how those work I mean I I lik ambian occlusion from the second it came into the software but playing with it and overlaying with shadows oh man so cool I I mean if you guys watch me model I don't use a whole lot of Shadows in general I just I I I like the model of Standalone but as soon as I could do that and the ambient occlusion I just I I don't know it's just something about that look that feel it just feels so much deeper feels so much better so check it out yourself am inclusion and shadows work great apart work beautiful together if you like that video click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and to be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below what do you think of ambient occlusion what do you think of Shadows how do you like them set the best to give you the best possible looking model let us know about that or or let us know if any other ideas you have that you think would make good videos we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
