hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to take a look at layout specifically a couple of things you can do with your floor plans to give him a little bit more [Music] depth depth is kind of a weird word to use but to give them a little bit more yeah you know just something where it's a little bit beyond just lines and layout something that adds that little special something that shows that you care about the floor plans that you're making so let's take a look at those three things right now all right so I got a very very simple model to work from here uh if we orbit a little bit I'm going to go ahead and take Teddy out there uh I don't need that I don't need her uh peeking in and casting a shadow onto my stuff oops spoiler we're going to look at Shadows so all I have here are some walls and in the walls I got doors doors go all the way to the ground the exterior doors have uh you know little edges here just to maintain a floor the windows you can see about a foot up or cut off I did this this this is literally how my model is done I could have done the same thing with sections but I again I wanted to keep it as simple as possible There's No Frills this is not the model that we're going to mess with we're just going to play with styles to see some different ways Styles and camera to see how we could you know next level this stuff so I'm going go back to a plan view all right so this is the thing I'm going to export so I'm going to start simple I'm just going go file save this View VI file send layout layout I'm just going to say put a letter that's it so there that's good and that's like literally that is good we could actually take this right here and we could uh start putting dimensions and door window call outs whatever we could actually start making this into uh a dimension floor plan that could could absolutely be good but we can also do some stuff with this simple model to go to another level now we've talked about things like putting leaving materials visible um you know doing color in here rather than all black and white but uh let's talk about how we can actually change how we're displaying our geometry to take these floor plants to the next level so I'm going to go ahead and hop back over into model into uh my SketchUp model uh first thing I'm going to look at is down here shadows I'm going to and flip my Shadows on and um when I start playing with my Shadows a couple things I want to keep keep an eye on uh one is the darkness right so um I don't want to go real dark like this I I want I want a fairly light shadow um the other thing is to consider where is it falling where do I want these Shadows to hit my model so can come in kind of kind of clean those up so that they're they're falling in the right direction and then again like I said lightness this up so I get the hint that that's falling on the ground but not I'm not hit over the head with it it's also not going to interfere if I end up with text or something like that I want it light enough so that I can see see through it so something like that might be good the other thing to consider is do I want it to fall on the ground or not so when it falls on the ground now it's falling outside of the building I'm looking at I'm going well that actually looks kind of cool but maybe I will just say keep it inside the building um this depends I mean depending if you have your actual landscape modeled and it's different and that the Shadows make a cool effect falling on it absolutely I'm just going to say let's do without and I'm just going to rightclick and I'm going to say update my scene update everything and then I'm going to go file save and then alt tab over to layout and to update this model I have to right click and I'm just going to say update model reference and there we go there's my Shadows so the thing to remember about shadows in layout is they're controlled a little bit differently in that I can just kind of come here and flip them on and off I do have a couple of controls where you can change the date and time but things like does it fall on the the ground or not uh how severe is it where I played with that slider to change the darkness that's all controlled in the model so you do have to change in set that up over there and then when it comes in here do have the ability to toggle it on and off okay that's kind of cool but what else I got well I'm glad I asked so another thing that I like the look of and we work with a couple of Architects or I have worked with a couple of Architects who do this sort of thing is Comm in the camera and switch from parallel projection to perspective and in perspective so that's you can already see that's that gives kind of a cool look um I can change this I can come into view no I'm sorry I was right in the right spot camera field of view and then click and drag up and down to kind of change how how deep I'm peering into this model you can see if I pull way down like that I get it zooms further away which is fine because I can zoom back in but you can see how how exaggerated that is whereas if I if I go the other way pull way down like this I get more of a a hint of depth you know so I I am acknowledging that yeah I do have some depth to these walls but uh it's not a ton and you kind of see how that how that plays with the Shadows so I can actually see what I'm casting Shadows of here I see that the window is just that portion so I could do something like this so I'm going to go ahead and right click and update again update everything and then if I alt tab over here right click update mod reference and there we go I got that little bit of depth added in there um this is nice this in black and white this is less effective than if I have some flooring or something like that but uh you can kind of see how it does add a little bit to it um it is a cool look it really does look neat I like how that that that the uh the shadow works with the depth of the walls um you have to be intentional when you do things like measure or add I'm sorry add Dimensions because I want to make sure I am pulling off of because I can look look at this I can I can come in right now and I can actually inference those inside Corners so I want to make sure when I do dimension I'm pulling off of the correct exterior top edges so I get my right dimensions just something to be conscious of if you work with a non-parallel projection so that's a cool look um let's do one more hop back over here so I'm going to go back to my original view um I'm going to go back to parallel projection I'm going to go back to Shadows turned off and I'm going to update this scene again all right so one more look I want to do and is some of you guys have probably already guessed this I'm going to turn on ambient occlusion and I know I already hear it you guys put ambient occlusion on everything it's in every other video it is and it's new for us we're excited about it but I like how ambient occlusion adds that just little extra depth to a 3D model even a 3D model that I'm looking at in a 2d view so if I turn on ambient occlusion right now um I do have to be intentional ambient occlusion is meant to be subtle so in the scope of the size of a house am occlusion in a normal setting which is maybe something like 50/50 50% and 50% like this I don't get a whole lot so I do have to come in here and bring the distance up and bring the intensity up once I do that you can see I kind of get these little these little shadows in the corner again it's not hard like those those the Shadows I had uh from the the light it is just little bit little subtleness at the corners just to give me a little bit of depth personally I think this is even cooler than the Shadows falling in I like the Shadows falling in um the fact that the Shadows reference you know the cut walls I don't really love the way that looks this on the other hand definitely gives depth I mean if I look at the two of these turn that off turn it back on I like that way way more so I'm going to go ahead and update my scene again and it's going to I do want to create a new style from that two because I need a new style this this style is now called style two and we'll see why that's important in one second so I'm going to go ahead back up to who back up to file I'm going to hit save I'm going to hop back over into layout and like I did before I'm just going to click right click update mod reference turn my shadow off and there I go now I just have that ambient occlusion goodness now a couple things to note about this Styles can't be edited as of the recording of this video through layout so I can switch between my Styles here's the standard style that I started with and here's my style to where I have the ambient occlusion on I can swap between the two but I can't fine-tune I can't turn the ambient occlusion I can't adjust it it just shows up in here so I can turn it on or off through the style but I can't actually adjust it or you know just flip the am occlusion on or off I have to change the whole style to do that the other thing to note is that if I come from raster and I flip from raster to Vector it goes away ambient occlusion is a raster rendered effect so it will only show up if you have raster turned on of course this works for hybrid because hybrid is raster with Vector lines laid over which is probably the cleanest best look that I can get this I can mess with my edges and that sort of stuff you know that but this look is great and this is Achieve by making a hybrid so just something to consider so there you go three different things you could do to your floor plans and uh maybe just to give them that little extra pop that you're looking for to set your plans apart from others so there you go just a couple of options that can help you take your layouts your floor plans and maybe just bump them up a little bit so you know they're better than everybody else's simple options Styles and camera settings that can add that little bit of extra depth to your floor plans if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us comment down below is there something else you do in your floor plans in layout that make them look better than anybody else let us know we might make a video about it we like making these videos a lot we like even more when they showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
