hey everyone Eric here and today we're going to talk about what makes a good person to add to your model so when I say adding a good person to your model I don't mean like a Good Samaritan someone who does volunteer work what I mean is the good fit for your model and good fit is sort of up to you to determine those parameters so for me I think about things like the type of person whether they're doing an activity or they're standing or sitting level of detail whether they're 2D or 3D and then stylistically whether they're wearing the proper clothes or the color or they're engaging again with the space the way that I want so what I want to do is take a look at where to find them and then how to customize them to fit the style and look of your model that you want so let's get to it so I've got some people here these are just like my little warm-up people we're going to go ahead and recreate those I'm just going to get rid of them all that hard work gone let's do it again so I want to start um you can start in a few different places when we talk about people obviously when you start a new model like if I start a new one here we have a default scale figure now uh that's great as a starting point but I don't think most people use the scale figure in their actual drawings it's kind of just there as a placeholder um I want to go a little bit more specific to the space that I'm working in right now this is kind of a co-working space and I'm going to link uh to this model in the description so if you want to build this model yourself I'll show you how to do that but let's go ahead and populate this kitchen so that it looks a little bit more um you know you can kind of like show people in that space so again I've got a section cut here so I can turn the walls and ceilings off let's go ahead and find our people so I'm going to go up to window 3D Warehouse probably the easiest place to start for most people and if I just keep the Search terms super general just people let's see what comes up now now I'm going to get a variety I'm going to get photographs we're going to talk about each one again pros and cons Silhouettes um face mes and then of course somewhere down here if I keep scrolling I'm going to find fully-fledged 3D people let's look at each one of those so I might want to start by adding something a little bit more specific like if I'm not ready to go to 3D or I don't want that geometry in my model I might start with a simple 2D or you can try typing in face me now again this um assumes that the people who upload these add this to the terminology they add it to the name of the file or in the description so it's can be found but let's go with a face me let's just go back with two people here and just kind of start at the very beginning and I'm going to grab this guy here he looks pretty good he looks cool like he wants to work in my co-working space so I'm going to download him and load him directly into my model I'm going to explode him because remember he's actually a face me so I don't need the whole um outer shell so now I could try you know moving him around let's see he's um getting himself a coffee or something he looks fine there's nothing wrong with that but stylistically sometimes I like to get rid of the uh color so what I'm going to do is just make a copy of him I'm using the keyboard modifier here to make a copy using the move tool and then I may need to make him unique first it depends on how this model is built sometimes I can apply Color to the outside sometimes I want to go inside and apply a new color to the face so in this case what I'm going to do is add like a charcoal gray like a dark gray and see if that works sometimes what I'll do to is pull back the opacity so anything above 70% is going to give you a shadow so I maybe don't want to pull back too much maybe just want to pull back a little bit and there we go so we can kind of compare the difference just really quickly of here I'm going to just kind of move them next to each other just kind of pretend like there making a coffee and then maybe I'll hide that guy and I'll kind of just spin around and say okay how's that look that looks kind of cool and then if we switch that I'm going to unhide and hide him and get rid of my hidden geometry and look around so again I kind of like that neutral one I kind of like uh the one that's got a little bit less detail but again personal preference let's leave them both in right now because I've got a few more people that I want to compare and see what's going to be the right fit for me I'm open up 3D Warehouse again and I'm going to come over here I'm going to leave this people on here and I'm going to scroll down I'm going to find a different kind of person this one's also going to be 2D but not a 2d face me so you can see here some of these look like more realistic so you can see that some of these are actual photographs of people so I'm going to see if I can find one it doesn't really matter which one the problem is some of them come in as groups and I don't exactly want like a group of people I'm just looking for an individual walking the dog maybe won't work let's try if we type in the word photo does that help I don't know if that helps us it may it may make it a little bit more confusing let's see here I'm going to click this guy and I'm going to download him and see if this is going to work and I'm going to place him here so you can see it's a similar guy to what I had before but this case it's a photo so he looks a lot more realistic you can see that uh while there's no geometry in the face in the object or the component himself that's that's because it's all being driven from a photo now if I move him again back into space the level of detail in the model itself though is still very conceptual right I'm not rendering this I'm just going to do an output from SketchUp so he may have two much detail I may actually want to pull back on that but maybe I like the way he's standing and maybe I like the way he's dressed and I like sort of he looks cool he looks hip he looks like a guy that I want in the space but not necessarily looking at his face I feel like that might be distracting a little bit for the viewer remember the attention as a designer is on the space the people are just there for context so I may want to just for fun let's for comparison make that copy again make that unique come over here grab that same sort of transparent charcoal and paste that into place and again you can kind of look if I move him even next to his friend these guys are starting to work together you'll notice that the only difference here between these two is that one of them has the inner edges and if you start with a photograph then you can most often not always most often they're cut out so you're getting just the silhouette here I've got you know this was drawn so this is probably traced off of a photograph so you get sort of these almost like cartoonish inner lines so if that bugs you or if that's not the style you're going for going for just the simple silhouette may be the best thing but either way nice thing about whether you go grabb a face me or you grab a photograph the cool thing about adding your own color is that whether it has internal lines or not they tend to work well together because from a distance I mean can you tell that one has lines and one doesn't you know not really I think they work together as a group so let's go ahead and look at one last place or one last type I'm going to look in the same place which is through your warehouse but one last type of person you may want to consider adding to your model and this one is going to be I'm going to go with people again and I'm going to type in 3D and 3D is going to offer up a different kind of model now you got to be careful with 3D for a few reasons number one is that you might get stuff like this where these people look very cartoonish they're 3D but the level of details fairly low that's going to look weird you might get people that are 3D but they don't have any materials that might be kind of weird you also might get and I don't see any here maybe some of these like this one has 400,000 polygons you might get a person that is very very very high poly and it may be too high for the your needs so I'm going to grab this guy because he's only got about 2,000 Poes he looks like he's um ready to do some work or waiting for his coffee to brew let's go and pop him in at least he wants to be part of the club he says come on guys what are you guys talking about I want in so let's bring him in now why the three guy 3D if we're going to add the extra polygons what are some advantages and what are some disadvantages well one advantage is you can see when I rotate around the model these two guys they're always going to be staring at me whether I like it or not whether I'm uncomfortable with it or not they're going to keep looking at me whereas this guy you can see he's 3D he's not a face me component he's going to just look wherever you stand because when you rotate around him he's 3D so you can catch him at any angle which is pretty cool and also with rendering you know with a 3D person um if I if I check his geometry count here you can see because he's 3D light and Shadow like for example if I come over here and open up my Shadows you can see when the Shadows are turned on and I adjust the time of day you can see the Shadows are adjusting on this guy here so maybe it's easier to see without the um uh hidden geometry so you can see that the Shadows are actually moving around so if you rendered that you're going to get the Shadows under the chin you're going to get the Shadows under the arm you're going to get more DET realism with the way the light reacts so I'm going to turn the Shadows off it's actually not what I want to do I'm not going to render this for today I just want to um just kind of stay in sort of conceptual land for the moment conceptual land it's the one of the less popular lands at Disneyland so now same thing though you know if I've got this guy in my model I do like the fact I can spin around but again I'm may be distracted by the look on his face or I may not like the way that he's dressed so lastly just like the other two that I've shown you we can always come over here grab this same guy I'm going to explode him and I'm going to make him unique I'm going to come over I'm going to go inside and I'm going to grab all that geometry and I'm just going to paste that same sort of charcoal gray color that I've been using and I can go ahead and do that now why bother doing that the whole point is is that unlike these face me guys whereas if you look they're all always going to be facing you so like their pose will always be the same no matter where you look even if you used a silhouette the cool thing about that is if I captured this room from two different angles like one from this angle and then one from this angle you can see that the guy is engaging more with the space he's not turning to look at the camera he's staying and looking at whatever it is that you want him to look at of course if you put somebody else next to him he would be stay he would be engaging with that person or he might be um if he's sitting he would be engaging with the furniture better than a 2d face me person would so I'm going to go a and line up um going to bring him back all together and we're going to wrap up by saying by just kind of you know understanding that there's no wrong answers here and that ultimately you can cherry-pick or pick and choose from any of these options based on uh the look and feel that you're going for so that's it that was my quick review for working with 2D people in your model now we love 2D people it gives a sense of scale it also gives a sense of activity so it shows you know you can put people actually doing things or engaging with the space and that's really cool because ultimately the viewer is going to transport themselves into the model and you can do that sometimes by leaving people out and they can picture themselves in the space but other times having somebody in there not only creates a sense of scale but it also gives them a sense of what is you know what's going on in this space and how are people using it and that's how I see myself using it when I see somebody else using it because that's what we do as people we end up just mirroring um other people so I'm going to leave you on that note so hope you learn something new today if you haven't uh already done so go into 3D Warehouse try typing in different keywords pop them into your model and play around I mean the cool thing about SketchUp is always that it invites that experimentation and ultimately uh use the version of the people or the multiple versions of people that are best for your project and your needs so I'm going to leave you there I'm going to say thanks for watching as always and see you next time [Music]
