hey everyone Eric here and today we're going to do a little test by pitting vray up against sketchup's diffusion to find out which one is going to get us a better photorealistic [Music] result now you can see there's a vray rendering here behind me that's what I know how to do that's what I'm working on a project right now with the SketchUp team and that's something that I want to think is going going to be a part of my process now like you at home you're probably seeing more um whether that's Instagram or Facebook or even LinkedIn posts that are using AI generated images and for some of you who make a living creating visualizations question is is hey how much longer do we have left well I'm here to hopefully dispel any myths and rumors to say you you've got a little bit more time than you think so let's go ahead and pit these two up against each other and see who comes out on top all right we're going to come back to V in just a minute so what I want to do is actually spend a little bit more time in diffusion so I've got my coffee shop model it's a little bit of a different view that's okay I've actually rendered this one too in D we really want to compare apples to apples but let's go ahead and find start by launching diffusion now I'll be the first one to say that I am not a stable diffusion or mid-journey Pro now there's a lot of stuff you can do with prompts and with settings and styles and things that are going to impact your result because every time you tweak a parameter as you know if you've already played with this every time you change a slider it's going to reinterpret and it's going to kick back or regu what it is you're trying to do so let's start by going exterior photo realistic because that's what it is and I'm just going to type in coffee shop daytime just kind of being literal with what it is I know there's a lot more I can say about it but I'm just kind of wanting to see what happens at sort of a bare minimum so let's go ahead and generate and see what we get robots are doing their thing that's fine and here it is so I'm going to click on a few of these here maybe I can make this a little bit bigger just so you can see at home this is interesting um there's a wall there that wasn't in my view originally and it gives you kind of three versions so I get to actually compare this one which looks pretty good actually I think if you look at the way the materials um between the brick and the roof it it understood Vines it did not understand the glazing and it kind of put it with an ocean background which I think is sort of sort of cool and let's look at this third version yeah okay let's let's see if we can make this a little bit closer to what I had in mind so I'm going to say red brick walls and red umbrellas with black um tables and black chairs now I kind of wish I didn't have to describe it with this much detail but I like like I said you know the better the garbage in garbage out in this case a good prompt will get a better result so I'm going to go ahead and reset that and we are going to try again wait a second as they sort of cue the servers so let's look at this one we've got red brick that's for sure it sort of made everything red though and this is interesting it's sort of the space in between the um lights here these are like beastro lights and it kind of filled those in almost as if it's a canopy it didn't interpret the white space behind that that's okay I do like the flowering Vine I kind of like the facade treatment of the weathered red brick it did pick up the red umbrellas and I think those are okay too so let's see what this one did Red Door not opposed to that I'm not really liking the red brick ground I think it's a little bit too much red brick so let's maybe see if we can give a prompt to tell it what to render on the ground um concrete ground and let's also try um sunny day something nice and happy and let's also go back and do something like um what else do we want um some maybe trees in the background I'm not sure if we're going to be able to get that it may be asking too much but let's try so I'm going to reset that here here and we are going to also check our settings one more time now I'm saying respect model geometry let's pull that back a little bit if I'm I'm actually kind of open if you want to interpret if AI wants to sort of interpret and I do want my prompt to have a higher influence so let's see what happens when I say read my prompt feel free to take a little bit of artistic license and we'll see what that gives us so let's generate again and let's go head and look at the result it didn't understand that I wanted concrete ground now this might be something where I actually need to model the ground in and then that way it'll know a little bit better it'll have a material to work with it is a little bit brighter and it is a little happier so I think that's good and in this case it's still telling me that there's a brick wall Beyond which is really not what I'm looking for but you know on the whole it's there are some elements that I think are starting to work now again just for comparison but this is what I was able to do in vray um because I can control the metal material the wood decking if I want red umbrellas I get red umbrella just change the material in vray and then of course you can always um do some post-processing or add some filters or whatnot so if I put those two slightly different view but again I could I could um let's see I'm going to see if I can put those here I'll just do it in editing I'm going to move one over and put those two up next to each other and you can see that to me I don't like the guessing game I like to know that if I make this umbrella here I want it to be exactly there or if I don't want light poles I'm not going to get light poles if I want a particular Shadows to hit a certain place I could go into SketchUp and I can turn my shadow settings on and I can adjust the Shadows so that they hit exact L where I only and exactly where I want them so in that case the level of control that I have using uh vray if I come over here tool pallets vray for SketchUp you know open that up and again if vray is not your choice that's fine you can always um do the same thing with something like control that material um add emissive materials all that level of control that you get with the vray is something that I really really appreciate and I could spend I don't know I could probably spend days with different prompts and not get sort of the result that I'm after but listen I don't want to sit here and just rag on diffusion because that's not my point my point is to say that it's not meant to be a photorealistic render ing replacement it's a conceptual it's more of like a generate an idea on something simple or do something out of the box give me something if you're going to guess and you're going to give me something that I'm not expecting well then go big go for it so for example I don't know I looked online and I was just browsing for different um you know again I said I'm not a prompt engineer but you can just look up here like here's a website right here where it says 70 stable diffusion AR arure prompts and that's kind of cool so you could go through and read some of these flower gardens concert halls and this one I thought was fun a library nestled within a vibrant coral reef so let's come back over here and let's do that again let's pop that prompt in and then let's look at you know respecting model geometry bring that down prompt influence leave that high and let's see it does let me do no style let's do no style because I want to let them I want to let stable diffusion tell me what style it wants I'm going to reset the camera one more time and I'm going to click generate and I think this is where you start to see where diffusion begins to shine and I think in this case literally this is not something I would probably be able to create in vray this kind of result it would be something I wouldn't think of doing it's something like the way that it interpreted the signage as Coral panels the way it turned vines into a reef um the way it put the entire thing underwater and cast these really cool light rays coming down that's an effect that I probably wouldn't be able to do at all in VR wouldn't even think of how to approach this the sand the fish really interesting and weird and psychedelic and imaginative and fun so let's do one more of those prompts because I want to kind of just reiterate that this this is more about early stage ideation and sort of out of the box thinking and that that is where you know these tools at least as where they are right now is going to um it's going to thrive so let's see here I want to do what was going to work with my coffee shop um this one talks about a cyberpunk city that would be cool I like that let's go ahead and see if we can get that to work so I'm going to replace that prompt paste it right in I'm going to leave all the other settings alone CU I actually did like what it did just there and then I'm going to of course I've already reset this so I'm just going to hit generate and let's see our result so little bit interesting I think it interpreted the inside of the coffee shop as the city so maybe not exactly what we're going for for but again a cool look looks like a rooftop deck that you're kind of looking out onto sort of a futuristic city and again it also has to do with you know the model that I'm working with you know I could just use something like a simple Cube and tell like maybe just like a simple massing shape and let diffusion do most of the heavy lifting in this case the more detail I have the more I'm also giving diffusion the opportunity to guess at what each of those pieces are and it may guess right or it may guess wrong or it may just surprise you so either way you know you can kind of see where diffusion is beginning to shine versus where in my opinion it still has a lot of room to grow so I'm going to stop there uh if you haven't played with diffusion yet I'm going to encourage you to go do that it's an extension you can find it if you don't have it with your version depending on which version of SketchUp you have you can go ahead and find it in the extension warehouse and add it and you know just test it out and play with it and see what you come up with and I think again that's the cool thing VR I want that ultimate control I want to know exactly what I'm going to get as a result but with diffusion I don't know what I'm going to get and that's kind of the wild bit about it so I'm going to go ahead and leave you there and again give it a try yourself tell me what you think in the comments what do you think are you worried about your time running up do you feel like this is encouraging or or is this discouraging let me know your thoughts and uh let's keep this conversation going there so thanks as always for watching and tuning in and I'll see you next time [Music]
