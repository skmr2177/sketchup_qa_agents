hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to talk about design iterations and how you can display them quickly and easily with tags and scenes so this model we're going to take a look at is the product of a live stream we did a challenge on a live stream designing a cabin in one 10 and 60 minutes so I'm only pointing that out just to say that this is not a legitimate uh designed model where you went from conceptual massing and added detailing and that sort of thing but uh it it clearly illustrates the process so we're going to go in and talk about how we can use tags and scenes to walk somebody through that intentional design going from the initial massing the shape the size into the final actual model or or or the the final step or maybe final Maybe preliminary final I don't know the step that we got to that I want to show the customer so we're going to take a look at that right now all right so here we go here is our our model and and I'm actually turn this off here's what we're starting with right so we got some sort of a a slab or something and some terrain around it and we're building a cabin on here so what happened the way this process worked was in a minute I roughed up this this little you know this is kind of what I want is the mono sloped roof I want the chimney on this side with the fireplace uh this is you know I'm thinking like this is maybe facing uh South so this is put some big Windows here um but this was the initial concept this was the mass right from there we added in some more detail so this was 10 minutes of design time but you know here's here's where you're going to have this nice big porch have these these windows all around surrounding this probably be a door a little more realistic size for uh a chimney I think that last one was like 8 ft deep or something like that ridiculous but uh you know this this is a little more refined and then of course we uh just an hour design that finally put in the uh this View and you know this came with some trees and some some more laid out properly laid out here's what it could look like at the lower lower space on there too so this got me thinking like so I I went through and grouped it right this could happen in the real design too so I could actually as I'm going I could take basically snapshots grab everything make it a group set it aside and that can be uh a different phase of design so that process wasn't difficult so I I mean you know as I'm as I'm sitting here as I'm working through something I get to a point I'm like all right this is Phase One all I had to do is grab it make it a group and in this case I set it on a tag so in this case my tag was 1 minute 10 minute and then of course 60 Minute so you can see that that's this is what I created um these were what I would say like I said the design steps I went through in massing and kind of going into more detail laying out you you'll have your own process for it so what these steps are are kind of not important to what we want to actually look at what I want to look at now is how do I take this and make them presentable back I could I mean this is definitely possible I can always come over here and toggle stuff on and off but I I really like using scenes for things so I'm going to take a look at using scenes to make it quick and easy to toggle through these so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go pull up my scenes and with my initial Mass created I'm going to hit plus actually before I hit plus I'm going to drop down the details of the scene I don't want to set everything the only thing I want to actually create with this scene so this this scene is just going to be used to get me to this one minute conceptual massing View so I'm going to only have visible Tags I'm going turn everything else off just visible tags and hit plus going to go ahead and yeah sure create a new style not really worried about that there we go and I'm going to call this uh um I don't actually want any animation stuff I don't need that okay then I'm I'm going to turn off 1 minute turn on 10 minute and then I'm going to say okay create a new one again only visible tags we're going to call this one rather than scene two phase two and then you'll never guess what's going to happen next that's right we're going to go turn on the third one looks good and again visible tags only I'm going to create a new scene there and call that phase three now simple that took a few seconds but the cool thing about this because of the way I set this up saving only visible tags means that my camera is going to stay wherever it is and let me flip through these phases look at it over here which is really quick and easy this is a nice way to go through here um I could again yeah I'm saving a click right I could come over here and turn off this and then turn this on or I can just click a button here um the nice thing too is I turn it off of animations but I could in theory play an animation too so I could actually go and create an animation it's going to walk me through those phases as well the other thing I can do too is if I have something like a 3D mouse and I can come in here and like let's start turning this and then as I'm going through let's walk through the phases I only have three phases but You' imagine if you had more more than this you could actually walk through the building process and I could see this whole structure come together uh and just click through as I move it's also nice I mean in a working situation too if I'm working on phase three and I'm like wait a minute something's not the same what what was my original plan for this this piece over here oh okay that's right I was going to have something you could park a VW and that's why that's why it's different from the original phas and I can flip through real quick and easy the important thing here is again there's two things groups I do have to go through and group each set of geometry right so phase one phase two phase three separate groups um those groups then have to be on their own tags once they're on their own tags create a scene with visible tags only and you can quickly flip through it doesn't mean you can't have other text I mean have my hero rendering or whatever I want to do that showing you know here's my here's my model and I want to save that as a separate tag and that that tags include set camera location and Styles and fog and all that sure but just as a quick working phasing set of scenes uh by turning on visib only let you quickly and easily flip to those views so this is a quick and easy one this was this was not a long drawn out uh pretty easy way to do that uh and this I'm showing this as kind of a phasing as a design phase as the design process but this could be used so many different ways you could use this uh in showing you know construction phases this could be as as something goes up or demolition phases as something comes down um this could be the life cycle of a project and how you go through um so many things to do anything that's an incremental view could be done just this way put them in groups put the groups on tags connect the tags to Vis to visible tag only scenes and allow you to step through or back through different phases of your model if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you used something like this uh do you have a better way or a different process that you use something like this for do you have a different idea you think would make a good video leave it in the comments down below we might like making these videos a lot but we like them even more and show them something you want to see thank you [Music]
