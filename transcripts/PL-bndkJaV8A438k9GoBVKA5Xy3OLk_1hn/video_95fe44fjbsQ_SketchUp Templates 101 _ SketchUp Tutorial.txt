Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about setting up your template and your default template in [Music] SketchUp. So, actually a couple things we're going to hit on. One is we're going to talk about what is in a template. Like what is that? What does that mean when you say a template? What is that? I mean, obviously it's a preset of some sort, but what all is included in a SketchUp template? That's the first thing we're going to touch on. Then we're going to talk about how to set it up, how to save it, and how to choose if it's your default or just one of the templates you choose from. Let's hop in. All right. So, I'm right now I'm with the the first default basic, I think it's called, something like that. But, uh, it's got TomTom here, gray floor. I just, you know, that sky blue background with the axis right in the front. Uh, this is the simplest template. There's really nothing much going on here. Uh but a template can be used for so much. I can put so much stuff in here. So I want to talk a little bit about what it is that makes up a template uh before we go any further. So first thing is what's in the model when you start. Most templates have this scale figure. If it's if it's a default template from SketchUp, it is the years each each release each annual release has a different figure here. So it's that that year's figure. So this is SketchUp 225. So we have TomTom here. Uh that component's in here. It's a face me component just a little ways from the axis. Uh yeah, pretty simple, pretty cool. That's easy. We do put this in here on purpose. It's not just to brag that we are people. Um it is to have a humsized thing. Otherwise, I come in here, right, and I draw a rectangle and I push pull this up. How big is this? Is this the size of a wood block like a child's toy? Is this, you know, could I fit a car inside here? If I'm just zoomed in like this, I really have no idea unless I start checking lengths and sides. If I look at it here, I can go, okay, so it's probably like a couple feet tall because TomTom's a human size person. Um, all right. So, that's the one thing. What's going on on the screen? And not just not just like what components are in here on the screen, but also things like do I want my axes on? Do I want to turn my axes on or off? Um, what what camera do I want to save in my my default parallel or perspective? All of that is part of the template. Additionally, if we come over to, and I'm I'm on Mac, so I'm going to show you the Mac Wind Windows here, but this is the same stuff that's in the tab bar on a Windows machine. Um, tags. If you have tags created and you save a template, that template will show up with tags. So, this is really cool. If you do, you know, similar work day after day, you're design houses again and again and again, you do landscape, you do whatever it is you do, if you use the same tags repeatedly, you can set them up in your template, save that template, and they will show up automatically populated. Now, you do have to be careful because if you purge, you can get rid of empty tags. So, you do have to be conscious of the fact that empty content will get thrown away if you purge. So if I if you save this and then the first thing you do is you purge, it's going to wipe all those out. But if you want to populate tags, you can do that and they'll show up in there. Likewise, styles. So in here, this is the default style, right? So I got this this style here. And I could go through here and see, okay, I got edges and profiles. All my lines are the same colors. Uh my materials, ambient occlusion, what's the background like, watermarks, uh my selection and section information. All of this is also saved into this template. So if you find yourself repeatedly like every time I come in here, I come in here and I set my section line width back to one and change away from the gray fill to a blue fill. What whatever it is, you don't like doing that every time. Do it once. Save it into your template and then when you come in, you won't have to do it again. Likewise, keep moving down here. Scenes. Scenes can also be saved. This is really cool because if you do again if you do repeated types of things, if I want to always have, you know, like this front-facing scene, top face and from the side scene, top view, um, if I do the same views over and over again, you can add them. You can add sections and save them in here too and then key those sections to scenes. All that can be set up and saved over and over saved and then used over and over again. Uh, big time saver. I so many people I talk to first thing they do is they come in and they they get rid of the scale figure and then they go do this and they do this and they do the same stuff over and over again. They can save themselves so much time by changing that once and saving as a scene. So we'll come we're going to come back here and actually do this but I want to just run through the things real quick. Uh new to Sketch 2025 is of course environments. So you can see right now we have no environment in this default scene. So, if I wanted to come in and say always start with the same environment and then choose how does that actually get applied, I could set all of that up right here one time, save it, and then always show up that same way. Um, uh, the other thing is components, right? Components. If you have components that you use repeatedly, so I always drop in the same 2D scale figures in all my drawings. I use the same face me trees. I use the same whatever it is the same furniture cars whatever set dressing you use the same one all the time you load it in every time you can save it in here not even it doesn't have to be in your model you can just save it in as a component and it will be here in the component browser ready for your drag in now point of clarification like the rest of these uh aren't going to affect the file size so much once you start adding components it is going to save that file into your template So, opening starting a new file if it's got, you know, if I put 70 components in here sounds great because I have everything right here ready for me. The problem is every time you open the model, even though they're not on the screen, if they're saved in here as components, it has to go through and open all those up, make sure they're all there. So, this can can weigh down an empty template by saving a bunch of stuff in here. So, just something to be note to note there. Um, last couple things. Fogs. Fogs. I've never pluralized fog before, but I guess it would be fogs. Fog settings, maybe that's where I was going. Fog setting and shadow settings can also be enabled and uh set. So, you can actually come in here and choose how do I want those to go and they'll be saved also. So, if you always build in the same location in like a certain time of day to show your model, you can set that all up and save that in there. Um some other things of course if we do come up here go into settings this stuff is going to be saved in here too. Uh actually this is this is mostly uh SketchUp stuff. So I'm just looking Nope. All of this all of this is saved regardless. So these are all settings that apply to all of SketchUp no matter what template you use. over here in window. However, when we go into model info, this information is going to be saved into the model. So, if you have a preferred unit of measurement or you want your dimensions to appear a certain way or your text, you can set all of this first and then save that. That will get saved into your template as well. All right. So, having said all that, let's make a template that's different from the default. Um, all right. I love TomTom, but let's uh let's change this up so it's immediately noticeable as a different file. I'm going to drop a new Face Me in here, and we're going to stick that in. And this is just going to immediately tell me, oh, yeah, this is this is the good stuff. All right, so different Face Me character in here. That's awesome. Um, let's change some background stuff, too. So, I'm going to come in here to scenes. Nope, not scene styles. Uh, let's go. So, I'm just going to edit the default. I'm going to turn off my profiles, so I just get the default length everywhere. I'm going to leave it all as black. Uh, I like all the default materials, faster transparency rather than nicer. I prefer that. Some people really like that multiple levels to see through, but I think this is that faster is fine. I am going to turn on ambient occlusion because I like it. You guys watch the videos, you know, I like it and I talk about a lot. All right. Over here, um, I do want to turn on the ground. Uh, that green color is offending me. All right, let's go grab like uh brown or no, let's just go with a gray. Let's just keep gray. Okay, the silver. That sound that looks nice. Uh, I'm going to turn off show ground from below. I'm also going to turn off sky because I don't want to see the sky because the next thing I'm going to do is pop down to environments and uh choose an environment I like. Um, kind of like that one. That's That's nice. I don't know if I've used that one. The Highlands. Um, we say edit. Yes, I want to use it for reflections. Yes, I want to use it for skydoome. Um, and then I can if I want to change this exposure, how how how that affects or interacts. That's I can change that. But, you know what? Highs is boring. Let's go. Uh, that's better. I want to get some sky in there at sea. Now, I'm just being midday. That's going to give me a shadow from above. That looks cool. I like that. Uh, okay. So, I got that in there. Um, let's say I have uh I'm going to get rid of the components that I don't actually use. So, I'm get rid of those guys and I'll just keep this one in here. Um, if there's some other stuff I wanted, right, like if I wanted more than just a person in here, I wanted uh, you know, like a little little table or something like that. And then maybe I'll drop in a prop that I like. I'll put this wine glass in here. That's a big wine glass. I should probably shrink that down a little bit. All right. So, if I if I had something like this where maybe I was doing a series of models for a bar or something like that where I want to start with something. I don't know. I'm making stuff up. But I can bring that stuff in here and then I can actually have it as part of the model. So, if I save my template right now, when I start up a new model, this would be Aaron. This would be this box. This would be the wine glass would show up. If I just wanted the scale figure, I could get rid of this. And you notice because I pulled it in, the wine glass is still part of the model. So, anything I drag in here, it's going to already be here. So, when I start this, I can just grab it, drop it in, and I'm set. Um, additionally, like I said, here's the other stuff I could come in and add. I could say I always want to keep a fog on. I don't I don't like use fog very often. If I'm doing something real big, I want to fade out the back. I'll use fog. But as a default, I don't like that. Same with shadows. I like shadows, but uh I don't love the toll they take on my modeling process. Uh it's a little too much work to do shadows once you get a complicated model. So, I'm going to turn that off, too. And then just uh let's let's go ahead and add a couple of tags. So, I'm just going to hit plus and I'm going to say um I don't I'm just going to or no, here's one I use a lot. I use a reference layer. ref. So, I usually put that in. Uh, and then we'll put in another one here that is uh main and then maybe we'll do like a remodel or existing. We'll put a tag in there called existing. Uh, there we go. So, we got a couple of tags in there. Um, I could save that in. I could get the look that I like. Where where do I want this to be? Once I've got all that put in, it's all set up the way I want. I go to file and I hit save as template. When I click save as template, it's gonna say, "What do you want to call this?" And I'm just going to call this um Aaron template because Aaron made this template. That's why it's called that. All right. So, we have an option here to set it as the default template. If we go ahead and hit save right now, stuff's going to flash. And then this actually popped open on my second monitor. Here is a brand new untitled thing with that template. So if I close this, I say file, new because the default template, that new, it keeps coming to my other screen. That new window is always going to look like this. If I say file, new from template, it's going to pop up and say, okay, which one of these templates do you want? So here's all my default ones. Right? This is the simple that we were working from before. But over here in my templates, I have all the templates I've created before. You see this little heart here? This is the default. Only one of these can have my heart. My heart only goes to one template. Um, that is the one that's going to show up if you just hit new. So, if I was to come back over here and say, okay, architectural is actually my favorite. Then when I just say file, new, it's going to pull up on the other screen, of course, that default architectural template. So if I go back into new from template, hop back over here, this is the one I want to see when I start new file, new. Boom. My other screen, of course. There we go. And again, because it's part of the template, if I come over here to tags, I will see, okay, here's my empty tags. That's awesome. If I go to components. Oh, here's my wine glass even though I haven't It's still big because I I didn't rescale it before I Yeah. Um, but that's still part of it, right? That's still part of my template. So, it shows up in there and is ready to use. So, maybe a wine glass isn't the perfect thing to add in there. But, like I said, if you put cars or 2D people into all your models, that sort of thing, you can do that and then have them just show up automatically. But that's it. That is how easy templates are. The other thing to mention is that templates are just SketchUp files. There's nothing magical about them. They are they're SketchUp files that are saved into a specific location. That location is in your settings menu. And if we go to our our paths, we can see hold on. I I can't talk and uh look at the same time. So uh here's a list of our templates, but if we go to files, we can actually see where our templates are stored right here. So any files that are dumped into here become potential templates. So it can be literally anything. Any SketchUp file you have can be saved into this folder. It will show up as a potential template and can be chos. So there we go. Uh templates are a funny thing because they they're another one of those things where people get concerned with or worried with poking at or changing or messing with. You can't so you can't mess up the default templates, right? Those default templates are saved. They're hardcoded. You can't mess up a template that comes shipped with SketchUp. Uh, as far as creating your own, like I said, it's just a SketchUp file. People think there's like and I I know like in some things Microsoft Word, there was a special file format for templates and there was something different set apart. It's just a SketchUp file. It's a SketchUp file in a folder. SketchUp recognize it as something. That's it. That's all there is to it. So, I highly recommend if you look at look at your workflow when you start a new model, do you go in and start clicking and changing stuff? If so, you should consider making those changes, saving as a template, and saving yourself steps next time you model. If you like that video, click like down below.

Most importantly, though, please leave us a comment down below. Did I miss anything with templates? Do you have a way of using templates that I didn't touch on? Do you have questions specific to templates or do you have an idea for a new video? Something we haven't done before, something we need to go deeper on, let us know down in the comments. We like making these videos a lot. We like them even more when showing something you want to see. Thank you.
