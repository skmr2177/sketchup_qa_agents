hey everyone Eric here and today I'm going to share with you three different ways to create phased or builtup animations using SketchUp native tools so real quick explanation what do I mean by buildup I think I hope it's self-explanatory but sometimes it's not so sometimes you see like a model that almost reveals itself so it's like you start at the base and then you know the sort of things kind of come in or they build or they fade or they transition in and I want to look at a way to do that in fact I want to look at more than one way to do that using just native tools here in SketchUp with the model that you see behind me so let's just go ahead and get to it all right this is the model I'm using it's a simple house and if I open up my tags and I turn on color by tag you can see that it's organized fairly fairly simply so this is kind of what I mean by buildup what I want to do is build up from the ground so if I turn the architecture the building off and if I turn the deck sorry not the deck that's just the order that it goes in it's not the order that it builds up in that's alphabetical order turn the Furnishings off and then all of a sudden you can see like we start with the ground plane and we're going to build our way up now I'm not going to use a color by tag that was just to kind of show you how it's organized so now what's what are some different ways uh to do that you've probably seen this trick before but I'm going to toggle my section cuts on and I'm going to double click this section here and then I'm going to double check my I think I need to open up styles for this because sections are actually managed in Styles so if you say show section Cuts just want to make sure that that is defaulted here so that you can um so they'll show so for some reason if they don't show just make sure that you turn them on and that you update your style to reflect those so you can see I've got two section Cuts one way to do this is you could delete this one and you can just copy this one up you want to basically copy it up above doesn't M really matter where it is necessarily it just needs to be above the building and then I've got this lower one and I've got this upper one so when you have this start section here what we're going to do is we're going to turn those toggle we're going to turn the toggle of the sections off and I'm going to make sure my style doesn't actually show those and then this is where you want to check things if that was a little bit slow under model info obviously for doing an animation in this case I'm starting with the section so I want to um I'm going to let that do the reveal right so if 10 seconds is too long I can drop that number down to six or five or whatever I want it to be and then you basically create another tag so the other tag is going to show the end animation so for example if I toggle my section cut on this one would be the active cut and then I would update this and then if I go back to the beginning you can see now it's doing it in reverse it's going all the way down and if I toggle my section cuts on you can see this one here is the active it's already the active cut so that's an active cut cut that's an active cut I have two scenes one showing each cut and that is pretty pretty cool now because both the camera path animation and the section reveal are done natively here in SketchUp all you have to do is just come over here when you're ready to export in this case I've exported this as an animation and I have this right here now this is pretty cool again you can Loop it you can go backwards that's the first way the first one of three ways and I think that's the quickest to be honest with you uh because it's all you need is two scenes and you need two section cuts and one so if you don't have to do the you don't have to do the camera pan if you want to leave it there you just each scene has the same camera location and then you could do the reveal without the pan so now let's look at it a different way let's look at what would happen if I started with a blank just a blank scene basically you can see in my tags I've turned everything off and then I've created four scenes that basically just control visibility so one for the deck one for the furniture and one for the architecture so now I want it to build up but instead of cutting a section where it's revealing it using the section cut it's actually just bringing sort of popping the objects in now if I just did a straight export you'll notice that like what I'm calling a static export you can very simply export four Images one two don't know why those opened in two windows but whatever three and four so 1 2 3 3 four let me show you what that looks like in a movie in a video because I think that's actually kind of cooler so this is basically what you call what I'm calling a build up or a fade up animation we already did our section up animation so let's press play on this you can see that what it's doing is um starting with the ground floor and then it's building up my Furnishing elements and finally it's building up my architecture now those cross dissolves that you saw there I actually exported those as four images and then in a video editing program I just overlapped those images so that you could get that cross dissolve so that's one thing that's the one thing that SketchUp doesn't do natively so what I did is I I'll export those as just images and then in the video program you can do that cross dissolve super simple technique you don't have to be a video Pro to know how to do that of course you don't need that cross dissolve but I like it because it shows that it's sort of like almost like it's revealing itself you know uh rather than just like bam it's there if you didn't have that crossed disel so that's method number two now let's close those and let's look at method number three now I did that same thing I did that same um in this case animation where I rotated around but one thing I did is I went into my Styles and I turned section cuts off and I updated it so watch what happens when you do that same animation now like from the start to the finish that kind of slow rotation I thought oh that's kind of cool I really like the dynamic of the camera movement but I really liked the sort of subtlety of the fading of the sort of each of the individual elements right so remember deck Furnishing and buildings so what I did was basically come over here and then just start with uh wh did it out of order again start with just the deck come up here and go file export animation so I actually exported three animations now Pro tip always double check um always double check in your options menu what the frame rate is so in this case I want 24 frames per second and if I know it's a 10-second animation it's going to means that this animation export is going to basically generate 200 and 40 frames not that you need to know that you can make it whatever you want it to be but just the point is is always double check that frame rate of course because that's going to control how smooth it is or it might control your speed depending on what your um if you go into info right it also has to do with what your transition time is between scenes so that said I would export this animation so this one camera path using only the deck and then I would do another camera pass of the deck and the furnishings and then I would do one more animation export of that same camera path basically from start to end with the buildings right so you end up doing three separate animations I know that sounds like a lot of work but it only takes a couple minutes to do do each one so it doesn't really bother me too much to have to do that three times and then if we look at the finished product now so I'm going to do this one here basically this is a buildup using my scenes so I did that exact same buildup that I did on the static image but because I'm using scenes I can get a camera movement as well so watch there's the camera movement get that cross dissolve fade that I did in a video editor because I have three different ones and then you can see finally I get my architecture that fades on top and I faded it back to White on purpose because I thought if I was going to make this as a gif or a looping animation or something like that then you want to do that sort of Fade to White give you an example here I've got this same one but I've got that same animation and I've got it as a gift so you can just export MP4 um to GIF and cool thing about having this little looping animation as a gif is that it's something that's really now easy to embed into a website so for example if I was sending out an email blog or if I was posting it to a forum or something like that often times gifts are file smaller in file size they play automatically and they may be just more responsive as far as how it fits into your your web template than what you would find um with it like with a movie file which sometimes the user has to press play so that's uh that's the one that I I kind of like the most of course if you go back and just one more time turn my section cuts on update my style um of course the fastest way to do it is literally going back to that first method that I showed you which is gets that sort of camera movement and it gets that reveal but it's doing it with these section Cuts it's almost like a little cheat so you only have to export one animation rather than three the way that I just did um with this last one so that's it for my buildup three different ways again just to recap you can use sections you can use static images or you can use scenes and scene transitions to export an animation which in then which case you can layer each of those on top of each other you can cross dissolve them you can mask them clip them add other things like titles you can get fancy you can get crazy or you can keep it super super simple but I like this phased building approach I like the how Dynamic it is and I like that it allows me to sort of control or reveal information um instead of just giving you the design all at once so I'm going to stop there I'm going to say if you haven't tried either of these methods pick one of them at least the one that you think works for your project or one you think's easiest or whatever and give it a shot um if you have any questions about how I um how I do cross dissolves what video editors anything that's sort of non- SketchUp related of course post those in the chat below and I would love to keep that conversation going there and with that I'm going to say thanks as always for watching watching and I will see you next time [Music]
