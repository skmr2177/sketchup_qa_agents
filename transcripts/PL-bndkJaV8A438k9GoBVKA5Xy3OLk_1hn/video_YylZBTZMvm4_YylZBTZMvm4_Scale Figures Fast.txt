hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to talk about a quick way to create scale figures so scale figures are kind of like Heather over here each version of SketchUp has their own scale figure and people like to make other scale figures the whole idea behind them is that they show scale of the model that's the name scale figure but it's almost a Rite of Passage to put yourself into a scale figure if you're a SketchUp user I used to be part of being a new employee at SketchUp you had to go get your scale figure made and get it up on 3D Warehouse uh if you don't already have it you should you should have you should have your own scale figure uh they're not difficult to make but they are kind can be a little bit of a time consuming process but with the newest version of SketchUp uh for desktop I came across something I'm like this makes it really quick and easy and I want to show you exactly what that is all right so what we're going to focus on is creating the outline the lines that make a scale figure filling these in Coloring them in that's Paint Bucket I'm not even going to bother with that I just want to get a white outline of a photo real quick now just to take breakdown Heather here you can see here she's uh got some some line segments here it's not not everything's not smooth perfect round lines uh that's fine this is where a lot of people draw them it's it's supposed to be a representation of a human it does the job it's perfect so I have a couple tips I want to throw out there I'm going to start by importing a reference image so I did take a picture of myself this morning and go ahead and import it when you take a picture of somebody for a scale figure you want to get the camera fairly low because you want the feet to be close to parallel you've all seen those pictures where you're looking at the person looks like they're standing up on their tiptoes or they're jumping in the air but this was down about the camera was about a put maybe foot and a half off the ground so this was as close to parallels I could do on my own um I'm going to import it large bring it nice and big like this and I'm going to make one change to my Styles and that is my Edge I don't want to use black lines I want to use something that's going to stand out so I'm actually going to change this to like a yellow color so just something bright I'm wearing red blue so they get around some of these dark things my hair it's gonna that that black line would disappear be hard to see what I'm drawing all right now I'm going to come in here and like I said generally speaking what we would do to do this is use a combination of drawing lines and then drawing arcs or possibly downloading the bezier tool to do this I'm going to do the whole thing and I'm going to do it pretty quickly with freedhand now what freehand is going to let me do is I'm going to pick a spot like right here and I'm just going to trace around where my lips are something like this I might be a little bit sloppy I'm trying to go kind of quick and I'm going to draw it so that it crosses over itself where it comes to a connection so right there it crosses over a little bit too much I'm going to delete that extra Edge and I have a closed piece to grab that tool again and let's see I'm gonna start this one I'm going to come over here pull up onto my face come around here I'm doing all of this just with a regular Mouse too there's no no tablet magic or anything like that and I'm just going to come around like this whoops down I'm gonna cross right over like that this is this is the the tip is finding ways to draw where you can continue to cross over your own lines right here I'm gonna start this next one add an end point oops I didn't get into prehensible I went to line I have a shortcut for line I accidentally tapped on it all right so with this I'm going to come around like this draw this up I didn't quite get my whole hair I don't I don't need that much hair anyhow that's that's excessive that is oh it's time for a haircut I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna cross it into this other piece see that that line started on an end point and ends Crossing in then I just delete this piece off the edge this doing it this way is going to allow me to really create a scale figure in a couple minutes as opposed to maybe you know like half an hour hour you can spend a lot of time on scaffold here now I'm I I do apologize I'm going a little bit probably faster and looser than I normally would I want to see if I can finish this whole thing in the time it takes to create one of these videos so we'll see how how close they get this is going to be an issue right because here I have I'd have to zoom way out to see my whole torso and get my shirt in one go so I'm going to break this down too I'm gonna go grab my my thing here I'm gonna start on a point here and then maybe I'll come in and Trace just my collar like this that's a logical break that I might want to put on again cross it in delete that last piece next time maybe oh man not really a good spot to break so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to start drawing my upper body like this I'm going to pick a point there's a fold or something maybe I'll try this I don't know I'm making things up right now I'm just going to come straight across like this and then this and then I'm going to cross that in like that erase that I want to give myself is kind of a place to pick this up so I could come here grab this corner maybe trace this around like this and then I can bring this line up like this and get a couple of these wrinkles something like that and then if I can oh look at that I hit right on the end point so I can just get rid of that line and that's closed up same thing we'll go grab this right here pull this down and I did mention this at the beginning of the video but I want to reiterate this is available in newer versions of SketchUp so this functionality this this this nice clean drawing of lines isn't something you're going to find like 2018 2019 uh I believe it is the 22 and up version of SketchUp for desktop it has this improved uh freehand tool here we go all right look at that so what what are we in we're six minutes into this video and uh I've got upper half of my body drawn again this is not shouldn't be a difficult long drawn out process but this is pretty quick this is definitely going a lot quicker than it would have without the freehand tool now I'm just talking a little bit to kind of eat up the space but uh I think you guys are getting the idea of what I'm what I'm doing here so again here I'm going to try to just cross right in there and I can undo and redo some of these edges too so there are spots like this that I'm getting so because I'm starting each of my line segments on a point and then pulling them around and dropping them back across the line I just have to delete one piece but there's some edges that don't look awesome like this right here so with this guy I might just come in here and do something like that erase that so there's definitely opportunities for cleanup I'm not saying this is a one and done situation but you can kind of see all right I'm just gonna I'll shoot for I'll finish the upper body here you guys will have have a full idea of how this works from there all right so let's get this other hand oh I did no I couldn't even see my hand undo let's try that again now the other thing I wanted to point out is this this is definitely not going to give the most perfectly detailed uh scale figure and honestly I'm gonna tell you right now I think that's good I think one of the problems that people are into with scale figures is they try to pack everything I might as well just go for it I'm just gonna do the whole thing they try to pack everything they can into their scale figure right there get the Checkers on their shirts or the uh you know the seams and their jeans every fold every everything and I'm not saying you shouldn't go for that but again one of the things we talk a lot about on this channel is creating performant models and if you have you know 10 000 edges just on one scale figure might be a little much okay I would probably have to clean that up that is how my jeans folded but that that makes me look like I got a growth issue there so all right so I'm just gonna wrap this these jeans up like this try to go just cross over a little bit there those two pieces and then finally I'm just going to do my shoes as one one piece and then one more over here and again this might not be my final this might be just enough to get me started maybe I'll go back in and clean that up now but uh yeah so I can see that grab that I'm going to start I'm gonna start by doing this let's rotate it upwards there we go and then let's scale it grab a tape measure we go for my foot to my head that's about six foot two yes there we go I believe a little taller than Heather that looks about right and then finally just grab all of that make a component and then one of the things I want to make sure I do is always Face camera hit create and there we go I said I didn't didn't color it but I could always come in here and and do that but gets you an idea of how to get those lines in Pretty in pretty fast fashion in fact I would say that is the quickest I've never created a scale figure in less than 10 minutes like that so this should be taken as a step in a process lines are a big important part of it the rest of it using Color adding details sure absolutely but man using that tool that that freehand tool gets you outlined so fast it's a great way to do it if you have a major scale figure before give it a shot give that a try and see what you come up with if you like that video click like
