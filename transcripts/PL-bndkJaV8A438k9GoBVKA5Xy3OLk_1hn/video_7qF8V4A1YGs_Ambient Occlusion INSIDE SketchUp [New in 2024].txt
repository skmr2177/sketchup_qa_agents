Kind: captions Hey y'all! My name is Tyson, and let's talk about&nbsp; built-in real-time one-checkbox Ambient Occlusion. [Music] So, if you already know what ambient&nbsp; occlusion is, you should be very excited,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you don't know what ambient occlusion&nbsp; is we're going to show you,and you should be&nbsp;&nbsp; very excited. It is a—brand new to this 2024&nbsp; release—Style attribute that will give you&nbsp;&nbsp; some incredible depth, an incredible&nbsp; kind of built-in real-time rendering&nbsp;&nbsp; capabilities. It's super cool! Nothing like&nbsp; actually showing it off, so let's jump in. So, this is a typical—what we might expect from&nbsp; SketchUp, right? And we can turn Shadows on&nbsp;&nbsp; and etc. etc. Let's open up Styles and just&nbsp; edit whatever we've got going on here. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; under Styles we have the typical&nbsp; Edges, but now, under Faces,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is this check box, and if we click this:&nbsp; Ambient Occlusion. All of a sudden you can see that what it does is it gives sort of the&nbsp; space between surfaces a sort of a shading.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's look at this, let's look at this in a&nbsp; different way, right? I'm orbiting around,&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambient Occlusion is still on, eh? So fun.&nbsp; Let me draw a simple—let's just —draw a box. And as I draw this, you can see that all of the corners here have this&nbsp; kind of shading to them. And all this is is two&nbsp;&nbsp; sliders that we have options to control this. The&nbsp; Distance. So you can see how sort of the distance&nbsp;&nbsp; in those corners grows, and if you push this all&nbsp; the way you get more of a general surface shading.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Intensity which, of course, turns up how&nbsp; deep or how dark to make that Ambient Occlusion shading. And as you saw, this is real-time. And it's that easy. There's not much more to&nbsp; say other than, "How amazing is this?!" So,&nbsp;&nbsp; let me grab this. Let me just get rid of it, and&nbsp; let's have a look at a few of the default Styles&nbsp;&nbsp; that are built-in with Ambient Occlusion, and&nbsp; then maybe we'll play around and create one or&nbsp;&nbsp; two of our own. If we come up to select, now there&nbsp; is an Ambient Occlusion section here under Styles,&nbsp;&nbsp; and let's just have a look at a&nbsp; few of these. This is sort of — I don't know what to call it — obviously kind&nbsp; of a golden-toned little sketchy Style. So you&nbsp;&nbsp; can just jump into some of these and tweak your&nbsp; way through them, or you can easily add it to&nbsp;&nbsp; any existing Style. So if we jump over here to&nbsp; Default Styles, and let's say we take this one&nbsp;&nbsp; but let's turn it to Hidden. So we have no&nbsp; texture showing, and let's edit it. In fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; what would happen if we turn Edges off&nbsp; entirely? Right? Nothing's going on. But&nbsp;&nbsp; let's turn on Ambient Occlusion. And we get this&nbsp; lovely shading and a lot of depth in the model.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's take this and combine it with— let's add&nbsp; Profile edges, but just with an attribute of '1'. And maybe make these Profile edges more of a&nbsp; light gray so that they're not standing out,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just a little bit of edges. How fun is that?&nbsp; And then just keep going from there. Do we want&nbsp;&nbsp; shading? Do we want textures? Do we want to have a&nbsp; little more of the Ambient Occlusion effect here? So you can you get the idea. It's something that's&nbsp; going to interact with any of the models you&nbsp;&nbsp; create. It's this shading that's going to happen&nbsp; between surfaces coming together. Go out there&nbsp;&nbsp; and try it! That's really all there is to it. It's&nbsp; just so, so cool. I'm very excited to see new and&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful images coming out of your SketchUp&nbsp; models! This is going to be fun, and I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know... I want to show more, but that's as much&nbsp; as there is. It's just that easy and that amazing! Really quick to show, part of the new SketchUp&nbsp; 2024. Give it a try! Share with us some of your&nbsp;&nbsp; most beautiful images, and I want to give a quick&nbsp; shout-out to our Dev team. A feature like this&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes it feels like it's unique to like,&nbsp; "Oh, they've just been building this for the&nbsp;&nbsp; past couple of months." But in fact, especially&nbsp; this sort of thing where it's underlying rendering&nbsp;&nbsp; engine performance, this has probably been in&nbsp; development for multiple release cycles. And&nbsp;&nbsp; you've seen some aspects of performance ability&nbsp; and speed, other things, but it's finally enabled&nbsp;&nbsp; the team to create this beautiful new rendering&nbsp; option that's just built-in. Huge shout-out to&nbsp;&nbsp; the dev team for this amazing new feature and&nbsp; all the work that goes into every one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; releases. There's a lot more under the hood&nbsp; than often we see. I'm excited about this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you all! Let us know what you think! Please&nbsp; jump into the forums and share some of the images&nbsp;&nbsp; you create with this new Ambient Occlusion&nbsp; Style. Thanks y'all. We'll see you next time [Music]
