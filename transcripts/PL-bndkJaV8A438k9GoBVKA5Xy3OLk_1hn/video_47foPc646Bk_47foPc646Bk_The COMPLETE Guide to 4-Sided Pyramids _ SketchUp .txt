it's time for design exercise how many different ways are there to make a four-sided pyramid in SketchUp hey there it's Matt here uh and I've compiled the total encyclopedic compendium to quote a hero of uh every single way there is to make a four-sided pyramid SketchUp um it's not even worth trying to Trump me in the comments because I've identified every single one no more no less and um so I'm just going to walk you through how to make each one right now these are them but uh we don't need them so let's delete them and start over I'm using a metric template for this uh all these triangles triangles all these pyramids are going to have a base a rectangular base of 1 meter by 1 meter and uh of course this is the first way the autofold this is the classic way in SketchUp you uh make an X split this face up into four and then use the move Tool uh without anything selected you can bring this Middle Point up as long as you're in the blue axis make sure you're not in any other direction uh you can use the up Arrow to snap to that and let's say8 height there we go that's our first pyramid one thing to note with this method you're not going to have a bottom so you want to close that up it's just good practice to keep everything uh solid number two is what I call the center line Stitch method so what that means is I'm going to use um inferencing here to inference this midpoint and then this midpoint or I can find the center of that square and draw it up again in that blue axis 8 and now I have my my peak of my pyramid I'm just going to as the name suggests Stitch this together one by one couple things wrong with this pyramid it's inside out so I'll triple click uh and reverse faces this is also best modeling practice and of course we have an interior edge here that we don't need it's Superfluous so I'll use xarray with X to get in there and delete it and now we have two identical ones in two different ways but we're just getting started uh the next method is is the push pole Stitch method so I'll push this base up and I could either type in 08 or just inference this known value of 08 high and again I'll make that uh that X across the top as I did in the first example now I have my Peak Point here and what I'm going to do is Stitch inside this uh rectangular prism you can't see anything when I'm doing that but if I turn on xray mode you can see that face was created and again Peak down to the point Peak to the point turn off x-ray mode yeah it's a little messy we got a little clean up to do um getting rid of that extra stuff we don't need and this one we can reverse this face and we have our pyramid that would be Push Pull Stitch method okay we also have the pushpull move method which once I push this up again to that same height same kind of steps as before X on the top and this refers back to that original uh first case that we did with using autofold if I go to move without anything pre-selected I can select on these points on the vertices here and drag them down to their corresponding points on the base and I'm left with my pyramid and here's kind of a Subway to do it I can also move the edges so I'll move this Edge from this midpoint down to this midpoint and this one down to this one pyramid um alternatively you can see I moved from point I moved from Edge I can also move from face which is you know four uh or not four but just edges that are co- planer identifying a face and I'll move all these down at once now I could you know move from a particular point but because I know this is exactly point8 high I can just choose any arbitrary point and then as long as I'm moving in that blue again I can either use the shift key to lock to it or press that up Arrow key and then as long as I'm moving in the right direction as long as I'm moving down I can just type in 08 and I'll move exactly to the right spot to make our fourth pyramid uh if you are liking this video give us a like down below but uh let's move on to number five number five is the we had to get to it eventually folks the follow me one of the follow me methods this is the follow me additive method is what I'm calling it so again I'm going to use that uh those midpoint differences to find the center of our uh base here and8 up and then I'm going to draw the triangle profile that I'll use for following me now follow me uses uh a path which is a series of connected edges so I'll select my edges that I want for my path select the follow me tool and select my profile and that my friends is the follow me additive method of making a pyramid which of course leaves the follow me subtractive method so in that case what I'm going to do is push pull up to that same height I'll use the line tool to go from this midpoint here down to one of the edges and uh as I alluded to earlier a face like all geometry in SketchUp is either edges or faces a face is just defined as the four uh co-planner edges that are connected so in this case instead of following like selecting the path by getting these one by one I can just use the face for that because this is defined as those uh connected edges Follow Me profile pyramid bang okay um now we are going to start our next base not with a rectangle but with a line so this time I'm going to draw uh this triangle first again that same height and make that triangle uh this one is called the intersect with selection method which means we will need um two triangular prisms to intersect so I'll pull this long it doesn't really matter arbitrarily long as long as it um is long enough to overlap itself and then I'll triple click to select all this geometry and then what I want to do is rotate a copy of it 90° so that we our intersection is that pyramid so I'll hit Q which is the rotate tool and it wants to snap to um the different planes here but I want it to stay on the blue plane so hey that up Arrow key has been really helpful for us today we're going to use it again midpoint and and then I'm looking in this bottom uh tool tip area where it says copy toggle copy is option so I'm going to hit option I believe that's control on a PC and then now when I rotate that you can see I'm making a copy I could try to snap to 90° or I could just type in 90 and uh although these faces are overlapping they're not actually intersecting so triple click and right click to find the intersect faces uh on that right click uh menu and with selection intersect faces with selection now you can see that this Edge breaks up those faces again I made kind of a mess but with just a little cleanup we can get to the point where all these extra edges are gone and we have our perfect pyramid once again now you may have been able to infer this but uh we're going to start in the same uh way that we started this last one we're going to use intersect but we're going to use intersect um with the solid tools uh and to do that we're going to follow the same steps as last time by making this two long uh triangular prism but before we rotate it we're actually going to Triple click to select all that geometry and make this a group uh in order to use solid tools we need these items to be solid meaning they're watertight manifold no extra geometry no holes or anything and you can see an entity info and I select that that is a solid same kind of rotation here with that up Arrow make a copy 90° and here is where we go to tools solid tools intersect wants me to select the first group the first solid and the second solid and that solid because we just intersected those to make our next pyramid great okay here's where things start to get a little tricky these were all the same height right we knew the exact uh Dimension from the very Peak all the way to the base but there's going to be situations probably where you're trying to draw a pyramid where you don't have all that information so if we do start with that same base again but we now know the the height of this pyramid uh sorry of this triangle we know this Dimension okay not the peak to the base Dimension but the kind of the long edge of the triangle and how we're going to do that is start drawing from this midpoint in plane with this bottom here that's going to be 8 and then we can um finish up that triangle to make this Edge now I need to rotate this to a specific point but I don't know exactly where that point is one way to find it is we're going to inference that Center again midpoint midpoint get the center I'll just draw this in the blue uh some arbitrary Direction and I'm going to use The Arc tool to solve this problem not uh using the a shortcut that'll get us to the two-point Arc tool we want to go to regular Arc here and then I'll start um with that red plane locked from this midpoint all the way to this end and then I can see coming along here as I get closer to this Edge I can see that intersection point that is the point that I want right this end point right here is where I want to rotate this so again Q for rotate starting at the midpoint this uh point of the triangle and then I can zoom in to snap right to that end point and I have this triangle selected rotate from the corner make a copy 3x we're inside out again and again we have that that one interior uh reference geometry piece which we can get rid of with x-ray okay great that's how we did it with the uh the known height of the triangle which again was 8 okay so what if I don't know the height of the peak to the base I don't know the the length of this triangle height but I do know the angle that I want to make a a pyramid I know the angle of the faces here's where our protractor TR protractor tool comes in handy so I'll use the protractor I'll lock to uh here the green plane and then go from this midpoint to this one um some angle let's make it a weird angle 47.8 okay and then I just need the same thing from this side 47.8 and I have this intersection piece between those two guides which will let me stitch together that pyramid as I did before edit delete guides reverse and now this Pyramid has sides of angle exactly 47.8 degrees great that's the protractor angle uh method as is what I'm calling that don't worry we still have one to go this one the leaning ladder face method um okay so I don't know any dimension on this pyramid that I want to make except this I know this Edge I know this exactly I want this Edge to be8 I'm just loving 8s uh on this video so how we're going to do that is again draw in this direction over here this is an arbitrary amount I'll start from this corner and I want to go 08 exactly I'll select that edge use Q for rotate and go from this to here now I might have to zoom in to see this exact point I want to get to the inference here we go right there from radius on edge then I know that this this line is exactly 08 and when I clean this up um we're going to make this one a little bit more interesting so I'm actually going to do this off axis a bit um I know so it's a little bit harder to inference the middle of that square using my midpoint trick here so I'll just do that X trick that we did in the very first uh example and draw this up again an arbitrary amount uh now I want this again to rotate so last time I used that red snap Point uh snapping to that plane doesn't work the same no matter which plane I snap to it's not the right one but with the rotate tool we can click and drag to identify a rotation plane and then when I let this go I can choose the start point of my rotation and the end point again I'm looking for that magical from radius on edge that we've nicknamed the leaning ladder inference let's get rid of all this extra stuff we don't need this I'll just reverse this face now and up Arrow I can go from the peak here make a copy 3x and what a beautiful pyramid with 8 length sides uh that's it I've nailed every single one and how to do it very uh succinctly and cleanly I'm sure you all understand and have no way to prove me wrong uh if you do I suppose you could leave a comment but there's no need because um I covered them uh again if you like this video give us a thumbs up please uh hit the like
