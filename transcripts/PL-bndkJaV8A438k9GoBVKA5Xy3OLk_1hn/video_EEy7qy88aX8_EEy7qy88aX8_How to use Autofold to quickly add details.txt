hey y'all my name is Tyson and this week we're going to explore a technique of manipulating geometry with the scale tool so this method is uh it's it's one of my favorites because you can just sort of get lost in exploring essentially you're going to be pulling shapes out scaling pulling scaling offset scale move scale it all revolves around the scale tool I think what we'll do is in this lesson lesson video Whatever here we're going to cover the basics and like introduce the idea of it and use mostly cylindrical shapes and scaling from the center of an object it works great for a lot of different objects you might model and then in a follow-up video we'll explore some more Advanced Techniques where maybe we're scaling just from one side or changing the axis as we scale geometry similar idea but let's cover just the basics of the idea here let's have a look so to introduce this let me just start by drawing a circle and I'm going to be using keyboard shortcuts um but the basic tools we're going to be using is Push Pull scale and using the option or control key to scale from the center that's going to be very important so be comfortable with scaling from the center and then at times we'll use things like the offset tool or the move tool and essentially the way it works is let's say we pull a shape like this then I select it tap scale and scale from the center then push pull tap scale from the center maybe offset Push Pull scale from the center pull this out a little bit scale from the center and so we're free form modeling this sort of object now this shape and the shapes that we'll create in this video you could create with the follow me tool and that's a great option but this one gives you sort of just more free form decide as you go and it is a good technique to know even when you do use the follow me tool because you may want to come back in and manipulate the shape afterwards so that's the basic of the technique I'm created this little top here let me delete this and come over here and let's say create the telescope an old antique type antique telescope so I'm going to pull this out and let's say let's offset this now maybe we won't use scale just yet I'm going to use the move tool and tap the arrow key in this case the right arrow key to move this out a little bit which will invoke the auto folding then they would pull it back just a little bit scale it down from the center again just a bit and if we were to say render this this would give us a nice you know little edge here like like our telescope is going in so then it's come out now we have the long part of the telescope and then up here let's say we offset this out a little bit pull this forward now I'm going to pull this one up to match it and then erase that edge to keep going and I want to leave that as flat so I'm going to pull it forward a little bit again but you see like well we're just extending it so I'm going to hit the option key or control on PC key on Mac to leave a copy and then I'll pull forward a little bit select this scale scale up keep in mind that we by pulling a copy we've left a surface in there and we'll probably want to clean that up so if I hide this I can select that surface delete it hit my keyboard shortcut to unhide and carry on now I'm going to go forward and I'm just again eyeballing this we're just having fun and maybe I would pull this in a little bit then select scale this down create a little bit of a chamfer there offset again pull this back offset one more time pull this back scale it down from the center and then let's say that was our final glass now maybe we want to add more detail here so maybe I'll grab this edge of the circle this circle and move a copy of that back move another copy and then I can select that surface copy it again and then select this surface and now use the same technique the scale tool from the center and we could grow or Shrink this and once we've done that we can say maybe it's a little too much but I want to be careful see if I'm not careful I will scale this from the opposite corner that's not what we want we want to toggle from the center so always be toggling and watching that you're scaling from the center and it's snapping a little more than I want so I'm going to over scale this and then scale it back about like that and then maybe select this and move it forward just so that this is wider we want it again we could keep adding detail we could add one little piece here same Technique we just used and say we want to add like an iron band here scale this up just a little bit from the center and if we want to bring these edges in a little closer maybe I'll grab those two scale tool now I'm hunting sort of I know somewhere here is that center point because what I want to do is grab and pull these edges in I do want to scale from the center if I can't see it a good thing to know is just have x-ray mode on keyboard shortcut now it's easy to see that and even if I turn it off now at least I know where to hunt for it so I'm going to pull those in a little bit so they get a more defined Edge there all right let's come back similar and just finish this out at this point you probably understand the technique and it's just a matter of practicing it so Gail from the center tweak things and again is this better than follow me it's not better it's just different and you may find depending on what you're trying to do you prefer one method or both but let's just finish this out because these are all circles it hasn't been broken up now if we used follow me you could and we've done some recent Skill Builders on this you could select the results and weld them back together so that you can still select these as edges but here's a tip if I don't have anything selected and I use the move tool and I hover around here watch see there's this line here and there's one up here I think uh sometimes people don't know that if nothing is selected the move tool will select these cardinal points where you can select and stretch a circle or a polygon or if I click here so if nothing is selected you can use the move tool as well to shrink cylinders and circles hold this one back and let's create the eyepiece and then we'll call it good scale that in order to pull that out a little bit scale it up pull that out scale it up push that in scale it down and from here obviously we can come in select pieces change them up a bit a lot of stuff we can do with this but that's the basic technique and now you know whether you use create a form like this but follow me and then come in and add some more detail using the scale method or whether you just use the scale method from the start it's a great way to know you can manipulate geometry and sort of create these sort of forms and object models just with that the scale tool okay there you go I um if that's something you haven't tried before go have some fun again I it's one of my favorite techniques when you just want to model I say telescope is a great example to practice on or a rocket or anything that's going to be cylindrical that you just want to manipulate manually it's a great technique to know and like I say We'll explore in a later video even some more Advanced Techniques but that still rely on this scale move scale method so it's good to know even if you don't want to model telescopes or things like that so go have fun go practice and as always we we create these videos on the regular so please subscribe please like and let us know in the comments what you thought of this if you have other ideas uh or suggestions for future videos we'd love to hear the feedback thanks y'all see you next time thank you
