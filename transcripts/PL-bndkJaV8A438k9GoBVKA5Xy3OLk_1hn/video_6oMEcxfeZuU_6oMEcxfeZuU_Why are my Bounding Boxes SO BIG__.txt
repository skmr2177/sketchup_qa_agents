hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about why your bounding box is so big in [Music] SketchUp in case you're not aware a bounding box is that's this thing over here the blue lines around this cylinder a bounding box is a visual representation of the space that is inside of a group or component you get one anytime you make a group of components uh and generally what's supposed to happen is very similar to what's happening here the bounding box is supposed to be right up against the edge of the geometry that's within it so we're going to look at what's normal for a bounding box and then why sometimes your bounding box is way bigger than what seems to be inside that group or component let's hop in all right so like I said this is kind of the the standard it's not I didn't do a cube because a cube obviously would potenti would fill the Box exactly and it would just look like a selected box so you can see here this empty space the Box what happens is when the box is created it aligns the edges to the global axis so uh these sides are parallel to Green these sides are parallel to Red the vertical sides are parallel to Blue you see you see how it works so this this is what a normal bounding box would look like so this is a single element if I came over here and I just grab let's grab all of these cylinders right here if I made this into a group you'd see that okay that geometry goes to the outside edge of the furthest left furthest right furthest forward furthest back and that's how that would look um if you did something like this I'm going to undo that and I'm going to grab all of these top up high and low um over oh we can grab teddy too come on come on and be in this with us all right so if I make a group now you'll see that that bounding box goes the outside of Teddy's component to the edges here to the top to the bottom see see this is what a bounding box should look like if I look at a bounding box I should see where geometry goes up to the edge uh on any side right so why every once in a while do I get something like this where I have a bounding box that shoots off somewhere that it looks like it just should not be I've come come up with three examples that I think are most common reasons that something like this would happen all right first one so I have my bounding box if I come in here I see there's nothing here if I do a select I don't have like a little zero length line or anything like that down here there's nothing there if I do a group select of everything it tells me I got 74 enties that's probably the sides here plus the uh top and bottom plus the edges yeah that I don't remember exactly is but that's that's what's showing up there so why does my bounding Box come all the way out here I'm going to say nine times out of 10 this happen happens when you like Go download a model from 3D Warehouse or something like that and you get a bounding box is too big I would say nine times out of 10 something like this is happening and if you just go up to view and view hidden geometry I bet 9 times out of 10 there's some geometry so in this case there's an edge coming from the bottom of my cylinder out here and it's hidden so if I was to select this hidden geometry H delete look at my bonding box goes back around the edge uh let's turn off that hidden geometry get a nice smooth cylinder back and if I come out here all right so that looks like my control this is my control over here this is just just the the right way so hidden geometry thing number one to look for toggle on hidden geometry see if you see that all right another thing that can happen oh no same case right so uh something else that can happen if hidden geometry doesn't show it you might come over and check your tags because in this case I have this little tag called I am hiding and if I toggle on I am hiding what do I see oh there is a group with some edges going out here that is on a hidden tag I can actually see this I don't have to be in the group to edit it either I can just tag toggle that on and I can see that come back and forth but as long as it's off when I come into the group my it's going to look like I have empty space in here but if I turn this on I find out oh nope there's some jump omry if I delete that it goes back and I'm deleting it I'm intentionally deleting it in an effort to get all of my uh containers all of my groups looking the same you don't necessarily have to delete it just knowing why the uh the bounds of the bounding box are what they are is maybe good enough in some cases so um maybe that that little tail is supposed to be sticking out here I don't want to delete it that could happen too okay so pretty straightforward so far geometry stuff in there that's hidden and like I said this happens all the time with with models on 3D Warehouse because sometimes when people upload a 3D Warehouse they don't spend the time cleaning their model up and getting it to the point where it's ready to be used so this is I mean we've done videos on how to clean up your 3D Warehouse model over and over again but there are things like you know extraneous geometry or imagery or whatever else inside of here that hasn't been purged needs to be purged but turned off geometry sometimes instead of deleting the geometry people don't want they'll just hide it hide anything that's not part of the main model um not the great way to do it but it does happen so if you end up with a model and you download it and that sort of thing hidden stuff is the first thing to look at and those are the two ways to do it uh under View and check hidden geometry hidden objects and then also check your tags all right so I got one more this one this one's a little this one's a little harder this one's a little more tricky um I was kind of thinking how do I make this into a a test a quiz for somebody how do we find this um if I come in here you see I don't have any more tags that are that are off uh I only have my main tag and then this this tag with nothing on it at this point in fact I can even come here just to prove this nothing up my sleeve if I delete that tag it just goes away just going away means there's nothing on it and there's nothing else that that's hidden there so what I did in this one is if I H show my hidden geometry now still nothing view hidden objects oh Hidden Object shows me that there is a section cut in here um section Cuts can be hidden easy enough because you can actually right click on them and hide them so they're pretty easy to hide they're pretty easy to get rid of they do show up when I go into hidden objects so that's kind of nice but what's it doing what's it actually why is it causing my bounding box go out here if the section Cuts here well the section cut is currently active so it's cutting part of my geometry off if I grab this section cut and I roll it back here see what I got that was like a magic trick was actually a second cylinder in here that was hidden by this section cut so this section cut was cut in here that section cut was then right clicked and hidden so let's go back to Turning hidden geometry off it was hidden and then that's why we get that long because the other cylinder is right up here against the edge but I can't see the geometry so this is an issue that comes up because section cuts themselves are hidden objects the geometry that a section cut cuts off is not a hidden object it is I don't know what the term is it's section cuted geometry so the fact that a section cut is chopping that off means I can't just toggle that back on with a view option or an eyeball over here in tags to get that back I would have to open up the group get my section cut back on and then maybe delete erase this that'll bring this geometry back and then if I need it obviously it's there if I don't need it I could always just come in here select that cylinder delete it and and then I'm back to that geometry turn my hidden geometry off that point get my cylinders looking nice and there we go so now we have one two three four beautiful looking uh containers those bonding boxes line up right with the most outside geometry and that's what it should look like with no extraneous bounding box out there um this was one that came up uh I I can't remember if it was a common on a video or if it was a comment on a live stream but somebody talked about this about how how they get confused about what size the bounding boxes versus the geometry um it's always bigger I don't know I don't I don't think I've ever seen a model if you have a if you have geometry that's selected in the bouting box is somehow smaller than the bouting box that's that's something worth submitting because that shouldn't be happening I've never seen that happen before generally speaking it is a box that is significantly larger or stretches out away from the geometry sometimes and like I said it usually almost always comes down to some sort of geometry something's hidden something is is is turned off something like that um I said only once have I actually seen a section cut that caused that but it made sense pretty quickly once I understood what was going on uh let me know if you've ever run into any of those leave in a comment down below if that's happened to you and how you found it how did you end up tracking it down if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though do leave us a comment down below like I said if if you've run into this before tell us about it if you have another case if there's something else a different way that the bounding box got huge let me know about that too most importantly though leave us a comment of things that you think would make good videos we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
