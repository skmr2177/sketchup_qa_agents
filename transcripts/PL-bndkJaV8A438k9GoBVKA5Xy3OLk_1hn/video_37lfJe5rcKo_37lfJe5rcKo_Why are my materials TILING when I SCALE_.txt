hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about scaling materials so when I say scaling materials what I don't mean I don't actually mean like importing a material and resizing it I'm talking about when the material is applied to a surface and that surface changes what happens to the material so you guys have probably seen this sometimes you change geometry and it like you get like repeating patterns of that material other times you move geometry and stretches and I've seen this on the Forum quite a few times if you don't if you're not on our Forum already check it out forums. sketchup.com and uh people are getting a little bit confused about what happens when so I made a bunch of cases examples of how materials might work on a specific geometry and we're going to take a look at where when they scale versus when they tile right now all right so I have have material right here uh just to show you this was just a a face I imported this material onto so this is undistorted this is the default look we have right here then going down this way I made a bunch of boards they're 10 in by an inch by 3 ft long so that's what we got right now so this is the normal we're going to look at loose geometry then we're going to look at grouped geometry where the faces are painted and then we have grouped geometry where the container is painted so rather the faces are white but the whole container has this material applied to it so there is a difference in how they react so let's let's take a look at how this how this works all right so down here I got my loose geometry I'm going to keep this as just kind of a control I could have put a little tag on there I guess it says control uh right here um I'm just going to come in I'm going to use Push Pull grab this face right here and pull it look what happens see that it's repeating so I as I make this longer that materi that that material is just going to repeat again and again again because the material is exactly 3T long the material ends where this this board does so when I push pull it just keeps bringing that same material out over and over here just reapply reapply reapply and to end so if I grab all of this minus the text and I hit scale and I grab my middle handle right here and I pull it out look what happens it stretches see that so that's good to know right off the bat loose geometry and I'm doing this with the whole box this basically what this board is all these pieces but it would happen the same if I did just one one Edge down there too same thing so as a face gets extended like this it's going to repeat as it gets stretched with scale it is going to stretch the geometry out so this is not a super high resolution image but you can see uh that worked okay for this particular image if you have a lower quality image when you start scaling you might start seeing pixels and it might look kind of messy but that's what happen so straight loose geometry here's what we got all right let's come over here to our grouped geometry so these are this is a copy of the same group the materials were applied to the faces so first off I mean there's a couple different things we could do here right because I could I can't push pull on a group so if I go to push pull it tells me nope no push pulling so I do have to double click to open the group and then I can use Push Pull and I'll grab this and this probably not a surprise some of you played around with this it behaves exactly the same geometry same thing so if I was to come in here same thing grab this geometry and scale it I will get the same behavior I saw before if I do that from the outside I grab this scale it again probably not a surprise but same behavior as before so so whether I scale the geometry inside the group and I'm using group same the exactly same thing happens if it's a component if I use scale on the inside or outside of a container so a group or component it's going to stretch just like it did so basically if the material is applied to the faces so that means it's actually put on the faces they behave the same now that's pretty straightforward right that's simple Push Pull just going to reapply that material and it's going to tile scale it's actually going to take the material and and stretch out things get a little bit different when you paint on the outside of container so those of you who don't know what I'm talking about this board was white and I just said pick that material painted it onto this board so the container has a color right now so if I look at entity info see the container is colored with the wood if I pick this one over here it says there's nothing applied cuz they're actually it's applied to the faces in this case whereas in this one over here if I come in the face has no material applied but the group does so this like I said straightforward up to here and then breaks hit not so straightforward so I'm going to double click I'm going to come in here with push pull same as I did before I'm going to pull same thing happens here that makes sense again still basically if you push pull you're not going to it's never going to stretch your materials if you push pull but what happens here if I scale let's do it on the outside first to test scale and I'm going to grab this and I'm start pulling it all right scale works the same way on the outside what happens I'm going to undo that if I come in here grab this geometry and hit scale what so I have an exception now because this material is being applied to the outside it's basically being updated as I change the geometry inside just like it would if I push pulled so if I scale inside of a painted container it's going to repeat this also so there are the examples um this kind of Works hand inand in a message that we often repeat around here which is probably paint your faces and not a container there are some some rare situations where working with like models that come in pieces where I want to paint the outside of container so the whole thing has a single color and you can switch it real quick um but in general I would say if you didn't do this so we'll just if we just stick with these workflows over here oh yeah that's a terrible illustration all right so if we just did these things here loose geometry and painted group or painted faces inside of groups you have very consistent results in fact I'm going to take that a step further and say you should really be doing just this in the middle I shouldn't have loose geometry flying around my model I shouldn't have paint on the outside of containers in general so for the most part if I create my geometry apply materials to the faces I can consistently know that if I go into that container Push Pull I will get repeating geometry if I scale the geometry inside or out I will stretch the material that's on there so this is kind of drives home a point that we've we've Illustrated quite a few times on this channel is the best way to get the most consistent results with materials is to paint your faces and then group your geometry or you can actually do that in either order you can paint your faces then group or you can group and then go into the group and Paint wait did I say that backwards paint your faces then create the group or create the group then go in and paint your faces either way works same results and they are consistent so I hope that came across that like that made sense uh the results are consistent regardless so no matter which one of these situations you have the same thing happens each time it doesn't stop randomly sometimes this happens sometimes this happens it probably seems that way uh if you're not careful about your modeling um like I said generally speaking just don't paint your groups and components paint the stuff that's inside of them instead and don't I mean unless it's during the modeling process like you're making a piece right now and you haven't grouped it yet you really shouldn't ever have loose geometry just hanging out in your model everything should end up in a group uh or container or I'm sorry a group or a component uh sooner rather than later so if that's the case very consistent and hopefully this makes sense like I said this questions come up quite a few times uh and I was surprised to find that uh you know there was a difference but it is consist consist it is the same every single time if you like that video go ahead and click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below you tripped up on this before is there any have you done any experimenting and found a better way a better way to to illustrate this to yourself or remember what to do or do you have another idea that you think would make a good video leave it down in the comment we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
