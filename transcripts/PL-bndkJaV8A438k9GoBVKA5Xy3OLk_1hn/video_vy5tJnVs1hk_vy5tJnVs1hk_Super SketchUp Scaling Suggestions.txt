hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at some super successful secrets solely for scaling in SketchUp that would just happen is called alliteration so here's what we're going to do we're going to hop in and we're not going to cover the basics of using scale we did that in the Square One video a little while ago we'll link to the square one video in the description what I want to do is jump past like the basics of how scale works and I want to dive specifically into how you can use scale to change your model some things to note about how scale works some people jump in you know oh yeah scale makes stuff bigger smaller that's true but you can deform geometry you can deform materials uh and there's some stuff in there that people don't generally know about scale and that's the kind of stuff I want to touch on so let's hop in right now first things first we got two things here I got this uh this fountain in a component here and over here I have a group of a one inch Cube so one of the things I want to talk about is how you use scale on different objects so these are two very different things with something like this one inch Cube what I could do is I could come in here I could hit the scale I'm just hitting s on my keyboard to activate the scale shortcut I'm going to drag this this way and I'm gonna tell I want to be exactly 3.5 inches and I'm going to drag it this way exactly 1.5 inches and then this I want to go up and I'll say eight foot enter okay so from that one inch Cube I just created an eight foot two by four I have used this specific method to frame entire structures to put in floor framing trusses wall framing everything has come from this one Cube there is a lot of editing that happened obviously trusted some stuff had to get cut at Angles and that kind of thing but basically the same geometry is used over and over and over again so an important piece of that is that it is a group and not a component because if it's a component as soon as you edit you know I I take one right here and I bring one over here and as soon as I edit this one I got a problem because it's going to change that but uh yeah so I can grab this right here drop that down four feet four feet long and I have two uh two by fours you can even use this method to report upon using something like the native report generator because what I can do is I can report on the blue the z-axis length of each of these components to get a cut length so it is important in that case just side note that I do keep this blue axis the length of this piece so if I wanted this to be laying flat on the ground I wouldn't want to use scale to you know distort this length like this I wouldn't want to do this this would cause problems because now my blue length is you know my inch and a half what I want to do instead of course is take this piece uh use rotate then to lay that down flat and then the cut length of this piece because the axis stays inside the group would be this four foot still even though it's laying on its side so that's some some super cool easy editing you can do with scale you can take just that Cube and you could make all the framing you need with a couple of clicks pretty cool when it comes to let's say none symmetrical geometry like this I can use scale of course to change the sizes found is this a little sitting on my desktop a little cute Fountain like that or is this you know in front of a Palace or something is a huge that's pretty easy right scaling the whole thing not a problem if I go and start distorting in other directions though so say I want to just make this scale or make this I don't like call it a scale it is a fountain I want to make this Fountain taller I can do that but look what happens watch the bass at the very bottom see how that base is squashing or stretching that's because scale always uniformly distorts the geometry so as I stretch it up like this it's going to end up with a longer piece up here than it is down here and this might be okay this might I mean this Fountain might not be exactly the fountain but I know it represents something that's eight feet tall so I'm going to stretch it up to eight feet and that might not be a big deal I might be oh perfectly okay with that where I want to be careful is doing stuff like if I grab this and squish it this way now this is obviously well most likely not what I'm gunning for this is a distortion of the geometry that's making it look weird I mean this could be this is kind of a cool look this uh you know I like it I like it but um yeah now we're just talking about fun stuff uh but yeah so it is possible to distort but you do have to be conscious when you move something in One Direction on the non-symmetrical thing like this and it's not a cube basically it's going to distort the geometry it could be good it could be bad it's just something to note and if you know this is going to happen ahead of time I can prevent yourself from ending up with some weird ugly looking geometry because you stretched it out all right let's talk about components everybody knows in the world of SketchUp if you come in and you manipulate a component it's going to change both components right so if I grab this this handrail on the end or this this end of this chair I start moving around it moves in both copies I select it from the outside and I hit scale I can actually take this and I can make it smaller without changing this piece over here now that's not without repercussions so I'm going to go ahead and squish this this way and I made a chair out of this bench that's cool but if you look at this metal piece right here see how thin that is versus over here significantly thicker because it took this whole thing and squashed it down you didn't notice it with these horizontal pieces because like the cube we played with over here they're just getting scaled along one axis this is okay if I'm doing something like you know maybe not that that exaggerated of the scale but if I took this and I wanted to make it you know it's a five foot bench but in I'm using it as a four foot bench so I could scale down like that if that's in the grand context of a huge park or something like that awesome all good no problem at all obviously if this was gonna get fabricated or something like that this metal piece is not the right size anymore that could be an issue if I wanted to do that then I'd have to come in here and you know probably use a combination of maybe move to move this in a specific Direction and then I guess I could still use scale on these guys right here but I'd want to do something like that if I wanted to really be careful about maintaining the piece thickness inside here but I did want to point out that you can use scale on the outside without affecting the other copies this is because I'm I'm distorting the container I'm distorting this this blue box that's around it and not the actual geometry so something to think about it's a quick easy way to you know add variants and old diversity to your components in your model uh without messing with every single piece that's in there all right let's talk about materials if I had to pick a question about scale that comes up the most often on our forum forums.sketchup.com for those of you who have not been there I would say it has to do with scaling materials so I have two identical squares here with the exact same materials on them this right here is just a face yes raw geometry this right here is a group it could be a component doesn't matter they behave the same in this instance if I grab this face over here and I hit scale and I start scaling look what happens I'm scaling down the geometry but the material that's applied to it is staying the same that is intentional that's how it's supposed to work if I grab this piece right here and hit scale this is the group as I scale it look what happens it shrinks that because again just like the bench I had over here this is taking the container the wrapper around it and squishing it so everything inside squishes together and that means the material as well so if you want to scale something and have it maintain the default geometry you do have to scale the geometry on the outside if you scale every scale component or group or anything from the outside it's going to squash down the material because you are that's what you're telling to do you're saying take it from the outside and rescale the whole thing all right one last thing I want to touch on this is the thing that there's several ways that that this issue uh brings itself to light so right here I have a little toy car I come in here I got uh the body and then I think each of these wheels both sides yeah so that's a component and then inside there got some nesting going on there we go there's two so I have a couple pieces here I grabbed that made a copy scaled it up by five so that's all I did was this is the group not a component made a copy scaled five boom that was it that got me this now if I select this I have the option to reset scale if I hit reset scale look what happens it goes right back to the size of the original geometry I could actually come in here piece by piece so I could grab this piece and say just reset the scale on that guy and then you reset scale and then you this is gonna be bad because it's gonna be all this different location now but I can reset each of these pieces individually or like I said you do it all as a group now this is not a good thing or a bad thing this is just a thing this is how this works this is it could be a great way to get back to where you were it can also cause problems the biggest problem that I see people hit here is they scale at a large scale they you know I do this too so this is not this is not calling anybody out or complaining but I'll model at a large scale and then afterwards take the whole container and scale it down to what size it's supposed to be that's fine but the problem is if you hit rescale on something that was you know 30 feet and then you scale it down to three inches and you hit rescale it's going to go back to 30 feet so it is something to be there's you know a caution on there uh if you do have reset scale on something that's small you may run into a problem because it may shoot it back up to the scale you scale to that you can always fix that if I have something that's small that would scale larger just right clicking and exploding and then making it a group again will reset that geometry so you don't have that problem uh just something to be conscious of you notice on this one reset scale is disabled because this is at the original scale this guy right here that's bigger he has reset scale so I hit that it scales it back down now that I click on it reset scale is disabled because it's at the default scale so that is a handful of suggestions specifically for scale when using SketchUp so like I said hopefully nobody's let down by the fact that we didn't go into Basics and how to use scale and modifier keys and all that I said check the check the description down below and you should see a link to a square one video that will give you that information that's simple stuff uh this I wanted more to be a little bit you know like the next level this is what I call level up SketchUp you know take SketchUp to the next level if you like that video go ahead and click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe if you know somebody who would benefit from this I don't mean that a bad win isn't it don't use this as a disc don't don't like call somebody out on their weak scaling skills by sending this video but if you know some new models with SketchUp and they might get some out of this share it with them that'd be awesome and of course Please Subscribe we create several videos like this each and every week and you'll be notified of every one of them if you subscribe and to top it all off leave us a comment I know I'm asking for a lot guide but uh yeah let us know what you think of this do you have a scaling tip that I missed I love hearing that sometimes and we do these every week so we have a lot of stuff going on and every once in a while we'll miss something love hearing you guys go oh here's how I use scale here's a tip that I found out leave that in the comments down below see you next time thanks foreign
