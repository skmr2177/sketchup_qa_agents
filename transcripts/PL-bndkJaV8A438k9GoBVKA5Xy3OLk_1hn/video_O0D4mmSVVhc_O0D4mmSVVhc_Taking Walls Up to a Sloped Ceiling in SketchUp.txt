hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at bringing walls up to sloped ceilings so as with many things in the SketchUp world there's several ways to do this process there's a lot of different ways that I could actually take uh my my floor plan my walls and pull them up to a ceiling uh there's actually some extensions to do this but uh it's not a difficult thing to do with Native tools so I just wanted to run real quick through my process so you can kind of see exactly how this could work let's check it out all right so to start with I have some walls here um I actually have a couple different roofs here too that we're going to look at uh but first we're going to do simple thing I have this I know you wouldn't build like this this is for illustrative purposes only I have my my roof here already modeled and done and then my walls down below um my walls down below I have two groups exteriors and Interiors again this is just how I tend to do this um I don't like having everything together I like having these separate properties depending on what I'm building for actually like having each wall on its own group and then in a separate group pulling door or interiors and exteriors uh apart so uh this is the way I do it so we're going to look at it in two separate groups now obviously this is this is to show you know this is step step zero then we'll look at step one and step two um if I look at my walls here I'm going to double click to enter this group if I'm pulling up to a flat surface it is really as simple as push pull drag it to there done actually we should probably do Interiors first then uh grab those pull those up just any any point on there that's it exterior same thing grab that right there pretty simple if I was to hide this roof I would see all my walls come up to the right height I can also push pull up to a height that's that's simple right like I said that's square one that's just bringing walls up now right here what I have is uh maybe this is a I don't know like an an i joist or a framed roof raftered roof um where it's just a simple slope and everything comes up to it fact is what we're going to do right here is the same whether the roof is a simple just a single slope like this or double slope or something like this so over over here we actually have a bunch of different uh vaults so a bunch of different heights happening same process I'm a little I feel crowded right now feel you guys feel crowded so I'm I'm going to slide this over 25 ft do the same thing here just grab that and move it all right give me some space all right so the way this works it is pretty simple it's not it's not a difficult process um again I'm going to come in here what I'm going to start with is bring bringing these up just arbitrarily real High um so I'm just going to pull these up doesn't matter they don't even have to lap or meet at the same height just bring them all the way through whatever the ceiling plane is so now what I want to do is so there's some stuff I could do if if everything in here was a solid right so if if the walls were a solid group the roof was a solid group I could do some intersecting and some subtracting um I could do the same thing I could could uh intersect with planes we're going to do it a couple different ways so let's start with intersecting planes so I'm going to come in here I'm going to do say view going to go to component edit and hide rest the model so I just see my my roof so all I want is the ceiling planes I'm not concerned about the rest I'm just going to grab these two ceiling planes I'm going right click and I'm going to actually I'm just going to say edit copy and then I can close that now I'm going to go into the exterior wall group that looks good I'm going to say edit paste in place that takes a copy of those two planes and puts them in the context of these walls now this is the the there's there's two steps left uh first thing I'm going do is right click and say reverse face that's going to put the white faces going up and then what I'm going to do is going to select everything right click intersect face with selection and then all I got to do now is select the tops of these walls so the the further you bring these up the easier it is to select and delete them I'm hit delete and then just use my Eraser to get rid of these extra chunks and there we go now my walls come up this is a little weird that this uh that walls right down the middle so it kind got cut there probably won't build it like that but uh you see how that brought it up copied perfectly perfect just the way I needed to all right let's look at using solid tools do the same thing so in this case I do have a fairly simple example here which is how we teach um but this roof is a solid and this o this one's not solid let's let's check out why that's not solid see if I can figure out uh what happened here to make this not solid um because I do have to have a solid to close this up to make this work I do have to assure that everything's solid anytime you're working with solids I highly recommend this tool right here called solid inspector it's a free extension I would say check it out and make sure uh uh you know it checks to see if there's any issues um my issue right here is is these two right here I just got to pull this out like that there we go now I got a solid all right so with that this is now a solid this is a solid all I have to do I'm going to do this I'm going to hide this hide my exterior walls now I'll just see these two pieces it's still there they're I they're all there I just just hid them so what I would do is Select my cutter first this is the cutter I'm going to go up to tools I'm going to go to solid tools and I'm going to say subtract I want to I'm sorry trim subtract will throw out my cutter afterwards trim is going to keep my cutter and just trim it out of this so now if I open this one look what that did it just cut that all out of there so I can just triple click this section delete it and now I have those ceiling those walls hitting the ceiling go edit unhide my exteriors and now if I hide the ceiling you see everything meets that same way now the cool thing is that this can all be done regard again simple ceiling here same thing can happen here so this is obviously a more cut up roof there's a lot more going on but the process is the same so let's let's let's do let's do the same things we did before I'll take my exterior walls run them high like that and I'll go into my roof and I'll select all my ceiling planes I'm flipping right upside down so it's any of these planes that are going to hit and I don't have to grab the vertical planes because those will never intersect a vertical another vertical plane um all I need is these horizontal ones are not horizontal they're sloped you know what I mean the ceiling planes not the vertical ones just the ceiling planes I'll say uh again edit copy those come in context edit paste in place select it all right click intersect face with selection and then I can just grab and delete those tops oops this is why we reverse planes look at that see see the problem see the problem see what it did that was me that was all me I did that not in a good way I forgot to reverse the plane and that's why so when you intersect right unlike uh cutting cutting those whoops I had a wallet wasn't closed in that one um so unlike cutting uh with solid tools what this actually does is it maintains the chunk of that original plane so easy enough in this group I can select a face and say Orient faces it should flip them all to White um hey nothing like nothing like mistakes to uh help you see what you should do um that looks pretty good all right and let's uh let's check out those ceiling or let's check out the uh is this solid let's check that out first no it's not solid so let's take a look at why this isn't solid flip it around look at a little bit try solid inspector uh turns out somewhere inside here we got a stray Edge so I'll say fix that delete that stray Edge and then we we now have a solid group I'm going to again hide the exteriors I didn't pull this up yet so I'm going to pull this in here run this long and then again same thing the issue with solids is by definition a solid each Edge connects only to two faces the problem is this line right here defies that so this this Edge right here going down between these where these two walls meet actually connects one two and if I spin around three four faces together so this finds it says it's not it's not one piece because that happens so The Simple Solution is to just kind of connect the two together like that and then now we have one solid piece um all right looks good solid group solid group select this one tools I went really high with that that's really too I mean but it'll make it very easy to to select and trim trim that out of this and then come into this group I'll just triple click this top delete and there we go so now I'll say edit unhide last and then just hide this roof again and there we'll see yep see all those all those different vaults this isn't necessarily how you would build the walls um you might have to go in and do some some cleanup or changing or frame down from the roof I don't know but uh as far as intersecting the ceiling planes that I had created that's how it works so there we go push pull uh copying planes and trimming and then solid tools to get you nice looking vaed ceiling wall ceiling meeting walls ceiling meeting walls walls what meet ceilings you know what I'm talking about so there you go um this is something that came out of a live stream actually uh if you don't join us most Friday afternoons Friday noon mountain time we do a live stream where a member of our staff gets on and does some modeling and we love hanging out with you guys you guys get to join us give us your tips talk us through issues we're running into show us how to do things uh and we get to do a little bit of the same for you uh join us it's it's a lot of fun and and stuff like this comes up we we end up modeling some real life scenarios uh pretty much every week so uh check it out it's really cool and uh if you haven't already please do click like down below and uh if you're not already subscribed please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and to be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please do leave us a comment Down Below have you done something like this is this a new tip for you and uh what else you think we should make on these videos are there other workflows or processes you would like to see we like making these videos a lot you like them even more we're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
