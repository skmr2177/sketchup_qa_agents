hey everybody this is Eric and today I want to share with you a couple of different ways to use native tools to cut some holes in walls okay so cutting holes and walls that seems pretty basic and you've probably done it before um but you know there's a few things to think about and also like everything in SketchUp I love the fact that you can do it more than one way so what I want to do is look at a couple different ways to do it and then of course more importantly why you might want to use the different approaches depending on your particular project needs so let's just go and get into it I've got this here I don't need this I'm going to delete it that was just for my intro video instead I'm going to start from the very beginning we're starting with the blank wall and for this demo again depending on where you are with SketchUp if you're brand new to SketchUp I do want to point out the fact that this is a great place for you this is going to be some really basic stuff but it's very very important uh to get the fundamentals right first so I've got a wall it's also grouped you'll notice if I double click into it you can see I've got raw geometry and if I double click out of it it means I'm outside of the group and for this particular example I kind of want to look at what it means to work with a wall that's already been grouped for example that maybe you work in groups in 2D and then you extrude everything and now we need to punch some holes for Windows or for some openings so with that said I'm going to start by going into the group so now I can actually edit the Wallace geometry so now it doesn't really matter what kind of opening we're doing I'm going to start with just the rectangle tool but you can see here if we wanted to use keyboard short cuts and draw circles or again a keyboard shortcut and switch to the freehand tool and make an opening that is a little bit more say organic you can do that so again whatever the tool is we want to start by making making sure that we have a closed face in order to be able to extrude or push or punch depending on how you want to think about it through the wall that's what we're going to do we're going to take this and we're going to punch it through the wall so again if you if I back up a step just before I do that if I undo sort of those last two and leave that one there so the reason why I'm inside of the group is just if you're new to SketchUp a good refresher is if you draw a rectangle for example on the outside of the group you can see that I have a face here and I have a group here and if I kind of spin around uh you might see this little flashing that's going on this is called Z fighting it basically means two faces are sitting on top of each other this group this protects the wall so that this window group if I try punching or pushing through you'll see in just a second it can push through or it can push out but what it's not doing is actually it's not actually punching a hole in the wall you can see that that group protects it but in this case I actually don't want that protection so I'm going to have to make sure that I am inside of the group so that's just why we're doing it this way so as you just saw I was trying to push this through using the push pull tool and I was not able to do that on the outside so let's make sure I select my face switch over here to push pull and then what you want to do is you want to pull you have to be careful because you can't see always behind your wall so if I let go and think that I pushed through you can see if I turn around the back end I go whoa I did push through but I pushed way too far through and it's you don't want to go you don't want to do it that way so what I'm going to do is undo that and what I need to do is when I push through I need to make sure that I know where I'm stopping so I need a kind of a a stopping point so depending on the angle that you're working you may want it to rotate around so that you can come over here and find a back edge of the wall so we're going to inference this back corner or this back Edge whatever is easier for you and then let go and watch what happen and she'll notice it disappears so I'll do that one more time I'm just going to grab I'm going to push through the wall I'm going to snap it so that it goes along the back Edge you can see I'm getting that Z fighting is exactly what I want as the two touch each other and Bam it's gone you can even look in the shadow just if you don't believe me there you go that hole is there now and that's great um I do want to point out again because I know that seemed very simplistic but sometimes you're working on a much bigger wall or you're working on something something really small like this like you're punching an opening that maybe isn't a window and you're zoomed way in and so getting when you do that Push Pull finding where that back Edge might be a little bit more difficult if you're trying to align to the top of the wall so sometimes you can get lucky and you can just push it and if you get it right it'll just disappear that doesn't always work so I do want to make sure that I'm pointing out another way to do it which is for me I have a keyboard shortcut but I'm going to go ahead and show you where to find this Edge style back edges so view Edge style back edges back edges are kind of helpful it's almost like x-ray mode only you're not able to actually go in through the walls and and delete geometry and stuff it's just a a way that um it's just for edges only so I can see those Dash lines basically it looks like I'm seeing through the wall so when I go do do my push pull if I'm zoomed in really close like this I can just toggle my keyboard shortcut for back edges and there they are and I do my push and then instead of snapping up high or hoping that I'm hoping that I'm hitting in the right spot I can also snap to the bottom of the wall which might be easier for me to find and then I let go and you can see there it is there's my other hole and that's great so as far as getting rid of these openings it's if you decide you change your mind and say that's not where it needs to be I don't want that hole if you just try deleting if you you just try going in and deleting the line you can see by when you have especially when you have your back edges turned on like in this case if I don't have my back edges turned on if I turn that keyboard shortcut it might be really deceptive to kind of erase like this and then think that you think that you're good but if you turn those back edges if you're working with back edges you can see actually that there's this geometry it's a little hard to see but um so there they are you want to make sure that you go through and you do a left select so when we left select we can just select everything and delete it so let me go back and do that over again instead of deleting edges I'm going to come over here left select delete left select delete and you can see that hole in the wall it just heals itself up nice and fresh and clean and back where we started so the cool thing about that is that you know there's no stray lines in there and with no stray lines you can open up entity info double check the group and you can see that we are solid and a solid group is kind of cool because that gives me the opportunity to show you one more way to punch holes and walls using native tools now you'll notice in this last example I had to go into the group in order to draw on my wall face now what if I don't want to do that maybe it's nested uh maybe I'm going to cut more than one opening like I want to do three Windows instead of two instead of having to repeat that push pull this might be kind of a cool example to dust off if you haven't used them in a while solid tools so I want to pull those open you'll see here there's some great tools we won't cover all of them here in this video but I want to point uh out a couple of them so what I want to do is just draw that same window opening and in this case what I want to do is push I'm going to push that as if I'm going through the wall but in this case you'll notice that because of that remember we did that little thing in the beginning where we are protected so we are protected by the group well if I make this window opening also a group then what I can do is I can see that both my window is solid and my wall is solid and when I have that I can come over here and I can select this one on the right here it says subtract so if I select the window first and then click solid tools subtract and then click the wall then there it goes it disappears what's cool about that is it didn't matter whether it was in a group or not as long as it was a solid it let me subtract that and then the nice thing about this too if I undo that is it doesn't really matter again how many I'm doing so if I wanted to do something like three walls all I would have to do is make sure that everything inside of what I want to remove is raw geometry so right so I have raw geometry inside of a group and if I want to get really particular here I could center that on that wall before I do this and I'm going to do that same thing I'm going to say I'm going to select my windows and I'm going to say subtract and I'm going to go subtract from my wall so that was three clicks select select select click click click and compared to if you did it the other way with the push pull tool you'd have to go one click two clicks three click four click and then if you wanted to copy this hole you could go one that's five click six click seven click eight Click N you see what I mean so it's not to say that one method is necessarily better than the other but depending on what you're trying to do the number of Windows you're trying to punch whether it's grouped or not solid tools could be the way to go I'm going to wrap up here with one more kind of solid tool I said I was going to look at two of them so let me just undo the holes that I just punched here I want to leave it back to where we were before I punched those and I'll enter those you can see if I move those there's no hole in the wall it's just the window openings that I want to use as my as my solid cutter so to speak and the other one is which could be a good option depending on how you want to do this is and maybe this works better if I just have one instead of three but if you want to you can use this one which is called split so if I choose both the wall and the window and I choose split instead of subtract what it does is looks like it didn't do anything but you can see if I move my window my window opening is now it remains it hasn't it did not automatically delete and that's actually kind of cool because what I could want to do is come in here and make this a component and then um give it a unique name and then come over here and offset this let's see maybe I want to push this back a little bit copy this depends on how much work time you want to do give this a little transparent material maybe give everything accept that material maybe something like a little bit of a darker color and there you go you've got now the you don't have to redraw that shape that you use to cut your window opening you've already got it there by using um instead of by by using subtract and you have to go back and redraw that shape again unless of course you have an off-the-shelf window component ready to go maybe would want to use that but if you're going to make your windows you can use that split tool and then that will both punch the hole and it will keep the object that you used to cut the hole it'll keep it there in place and you can just convert that into your component now some of you might be thinking well there are extensions that can do what I'm doing here which is cutting through two sides of a wall and Aaron just did a video recently called double cut which is an extension that does this but we're looking at Native tools today so I wanted to show you those two native tool methods I'll be sure to add a link in the description below so if you're interested check that out I'm going to leave you there hopefully you found this refresher useful again whether you do it the pushpull way and you do it sort of manually and you want that level of control or whether you want to maybe pre-think a couple of things work on the outside of the group and then instantaneously cut those holes using solid tools or again there's always extensions to do things more complex and more specific to your needs but hopefully you learned something new if you did give us that thumbs up if you didn't leave a comment well if you did or didn't leave a comment below let us know what you think we read these comments we respond to them and we'll keep this conversation going there so with that I'll leave you I'll say thanks as always and see you next time [Music]
