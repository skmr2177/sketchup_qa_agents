hey guys um Aaron and today we're going to talk about scale flip and rotate so um we've done videos like this before we talk about duplicating geometry and the steps you can take to do it so things like uh well scale flip rotate those are the things we're going to actually talk about now which one you use there's multiple ways to do it because there's multiple outcomes you may want to get to so we're going to talk about when to use what where and why and how okay so I have a quarter of a table here um you can see it's it's something you wouldn't if you had this you might want to draw it again it's got a curve it's got this fancy Edge on here it's got this swirly Corkscrew leg uh the kind of geometry you don't want to draw from scratch over and over again it is all in a group right now so what I have done for years is use scale to duplicate this kind of geometry so I'll grab scale like this and with scale I'm going to hit the modifier key to scale about Center if you're not familiar with modifier keys they are always listed at the bottom of the screen so you can see down here what button to hit to to change how a tool works I'm going to hit the option key because I'm on Mac and I want to scale about the center when I do that my middle point shows up and when I start scaling I'm flipping about the center so if I wanted to mirror this geometry I would for a long time my go-to command would be scaled because that's exactly what this does scale to negative one you get an opposite of what you currently have what you can't do a scale is duplicate at the same time that you are scaling so if I wanted to make it make you know mirror this basically along this face what I'd have to do is go to select it hit move I'm going to hit my modifier key there to make a copy shift to stay on the axis and bring it right up to the other Edge now I can grab scale and I can hit the modifier key scale about Center flip it over to negative one and I have half a table the other half same thing I'll grab these two like this and hit move modifier key to copy take that copy down boom right there snap it to the face by snapping to the face it assures that when I do my scale now which I'm going to do about the center again I can actually just have it snapped negative one and it's where it needs to be so with that I have a very big table um in just a couple of clicks it is there's some extra pieces there obviously because I have to go select I have to copy it and then scale it um this is of course where flip makes it much easier so having flip right here if I select this I click on flip I do it to the modifier key games if I just flip it I'm just gonna flip it just like scaling the piece by itself so I'm going to hit the modifier key to copy and then I'm going to drag this red axis over this face it's red plane excuse me over the face release it and then there I go now I could do the same thing I did before go to select and select both halves and then just do one copy to copy along the green but it's actually going to be quicker to just copy this piece to here and then copy this piece to here so again I could go out and copy both pieces and copy them over but to do four copies it's quicker in the flip command just stay in it and do that so obviously flip goes a little quicker than than scaling to negative one there's probably some scenarios where you know scaling the negative one is helpful but uh I don't know there I couldn't come up with an example off the top of my head so this worked out pretty good now something to note whether you use scale or you use flip it's taking geometry and reversing it it is mirroring it so like if you had something you held it up to a mirror it's going to be opposite so if I look at my Corkscrew legs here so here as I come down the legs you can see I'm kind of rotating clockwise over here if I look at them the corkscrew is backwards this isn't necessarily bad this could be good this could be what you're going for you know I want I want the corkscrew there's meaning in this the drift in towards the center pulls the viewer I don't know something like that but this is going to happen so intentional or not this happens with with mirror or scale if you want to maintain these and have them be the same you're gonna have to go to extra steps or possibly depending on the geometry you might be able to use a different command to do it so if I look at this table I have the same you know fancy edge here but it's just a quarter this is a square section so what I can actually do is grab this it's all grouped together again hit rotate I'm going to rotate by this corner and we go from here modifier key to copy around to here and because I'm using rotate I can say 3x enter and it's going to copy that three total times so what I get in that case is because my this only works this wouldn't work with this obviously because the shape of the table top is different but with this I have those four quadrants all connected together and because I rotated rather than copy I took this component or this this leg which was rotating the you know this direction so they come down it's still going that direction I'm looking at it rotated 90 degrees of course you can see there's there's a difference there but it's rotating the same direction now you're probably noticing because you're you're wise and smart and paying attention details that the top looks funky looks like I got kind of a cool Clover pattern here maybe I want that um so what happened over here is when I copied because I made a mirror and it's wood grain it looks like it's going the same direction in fact this looks like it could be just the opposite pieces of the same wood cut in half or quartered and the grain kind of mirrors itself so this this looks like it could be correct over here this looks like there's something wrong if I went and inlaid some other material or something like that it might look okay but the fact that it turns like this yeah it doesn't have it looking right now there is a case where I might want to take advantage of that we're going to talk about uh addressing these things in just a second but I do want to First say you know maybe maybe I want to I want to go with this I want to run with this idea so I have over here a triangle which is 1 6 of a hexagon and what I could do is I come in and select this material texture hit position and then maybe rotate that material so that it's you know something like that so it's going the grain's running the direction from this flat Edge all the way out to the face or out to the the Peak the tip this thing pointy part and I could take that and I could rotate it so if I rotate that option rotate here I'll do total five times so six and in that case it looks intentional I that's the way I would think this should go the six pieces all the grains go the same direction towards the center because I rotated my swirly Corkscrew legs all go the same they're just rotated around the center so that looks correct where this looks like it's a little bit weird I don't I and this is not a huge table so I don't know why this would be broken into pieces or why they would be separate like that um but really this comes down to what's the next step so in a table like this uh I what I would probably do is grab all these pieces make that into a single group because I want regardless I do that with any of these now the table is one piece but I'd probably come in here explode those those four groups in the center and then probably just you know make that all one piece so when I make it all one piece now all the greens go the same direction I'd probably also select and delete my edges there and there too so I have you know connected more more properly connected geometry um so that would probably be the step that I take there and that would address that so over here assuming so you could do the same thing here uh if let's say I want to keep this I want to keep this laminate where it looks like maybe four separate pieces but I don't want to you know have to group it all together so how would I keep that one thing you could always do is you could come in here with the race and uh just hide those edges so I could go hide this over here hide these two hide these two hide these two so you could do something like that which will give you kind of a cool effect without having to merge everything together and keep it in separate pieces there's a little extra geometry I missed there um the other thing to consider how to address would of course be like I said these Corkscrew legs so let's go ahead let's get rid of these three pieces let's talk about this let's talk about these legs so one thing I could do is I come in here and I could separate the leg from the table top so I'm going to grab all of this I'm going to make it a component I'm going to call it my new leg and click create so that's going to put it in a separate container and I'll just take this up here and I'll I'll make this into a group also so what I could do at that point is I could take this geometry and again use flip modifier key to copy do the same thing I did before just copy this around in four spots one more and then what I could do is I could take this group and I could copy that over here and then take both of those and copy them over here which should give me the same so now the legs are going the same direction and I have four separate ones and then obviously I could dress the top however I wanted to I could merge it together whatever but keeping these as separate components if they had been components before I copied it would have made a difference because it would have still taken the container and moved it but this would be maybe an option on maintaining that geometry whilst copying um so there are some thoughts I know there was a little bit of uh creative wanderings we walked around we looked at some stuff and decided what the best way to do was uh but that's kind of the fun of having a tool and figuring out the best way to use it um there's not like I said not a one size fits all because not all issues are the same everybody's gotta just has different concerns different things they got to get done and they're going to get addressed in different ways so hopefully that helped you um and also hopefully click like if it did and go ahead and subscribe and maybe even share this with somebody you think might have this issue leave us a comment down below too uh we love making videos like this but man when you guys weigh in and tell us your ideas or different ways that you might go about this that's when we create content that is really good and uh hopefully keeps you coming back for more all right thanks guys see you next time [Music]
