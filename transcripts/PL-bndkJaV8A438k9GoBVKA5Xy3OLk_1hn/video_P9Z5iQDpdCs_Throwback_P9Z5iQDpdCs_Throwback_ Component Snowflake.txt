hey guys it's January it's snowy outside and I figured let's use components to make a [Music] snowflake now if this idea sounds familiar like something you've seen before that's definitely possible so this concept was one of the first the very first learning videos we put out on our YouTube channel it was made by Tyson kartner back I I don't know like over a decade ago and it is an awesome example of how components work and I just thought let's do it let's do that thing and uh yeah there's still something to be learned from it and it seems appropriate so let's hop in let's do it right now all right so first thing I to do is um I want to do this and I want to I want to put it around uh what we're going to do is we're going to create a hexagon a six ided shape cuz you know snowflakes have six sides and I want to do it on the ground right here at the origin this isn't required but I find a lot of times when I start making symmetrical things if I can work from this one spot it makes a little bit easier for me so I'm going to take a line straight up the green axis like that um I'm going to actually take out Teddy and here's what we're going to do I want to make one slice from basically I want to take out one sixth of this and make it into a component and then copy it around so I'm going to come right here and I'm going to go from here up to here I'm going go from here up to here I'm just snapping from the Middle Point to the middles so from the middle of the hexagon where I started at the origin up to the midpoints on these two sides and I can delete this so this is the piece that I want to mirror around so I'm going to take this and I'm going to a component and I'm going to say this is a flake chunk there we go apparently I'm going to yell it all in caps so I'm going to take that now and I'm going to rotate it from the center from here option rotate to here I'm going to say 5x and hit enter and there we go now let's make things even simpler so I'm going to go into one of these copies and I'm going to cut this copy in half and then get rid of this half over here I'm going take that and make that into a new component um half chunk all right and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that and I'm going to mirror that mirror command to right there all right so there we go so now all I have to do is come into this one piece make my snowflake shape and it's going to show up in all the other pieces so let's go ahead I'm just G to I'm going to just make some shapes here I'm going to try to do something I don't know I've I've I've done this process of making a snowflake multiple times like I said the first time I did this I did it because I saw Tyson's video on how to do this and I thought it was cool and I wanted to try it so uh but every time I do it I'm like what does this snowflake look like again like you know it's one of those things that honestly I don't have a lot of context for I don't pay a whole lot of attention to snowflakes in general but uh but yeah I uh I always struggle a little bit to remember what a snowflake looks like when I have to recall one from scratch so this is my version of something like a snowflake so I'm just inferencing I'm doing some parallel some uh oh you know what we should do let's go here to the middle and uh do something like this so I'm going to go from this point to here and no you know what I want to do is I I I appreciate that you're playing along as I argue with myself about what I should or shouldn't do um yeah that's that makes me feel nice appreciate you guys just being there for me like that all right we're g put another piece right here feel like I don't know at this point I'm feeling like maybe I should have spent a little bit of time just looking at some snowflakes I know they're not uh you know perfectly symmetrical and stuff like that so um I'm actually going to make a change here I'm going to bring this down further like this instead of going all the way up like that and then I'm going to delete some of these outside parts and then like that and with that we have a six-sided uh snowflake pretty quick pretty easy but I don't like all these edges on the inside in fact I want to go in I want to like put a hole in the middle too so I'm going to double click to go into a chunk double click to go into a half a chunk and I'm just going to go do something like this and then erase those pieces oh that was a little too big I got too big there let's try this like that there we go give that opening there at the bottom and the other thing I want to do is I want to make sure there's I want even seams here so I am going to grab my Eraser and I'm going to hold on shift shift is going to allow me to hide the edges so there's still edges there there we go if you look at that you can see the grade out portion versus this portion and if we actually go to view hidden edges hidden geometry we'll see the dotted lines there but because I hid them from view it looks like it's all one big piece so if I click out now there we go pretty quick pretty easy I have a simple easy to do snowflake let's uh probably the last thing to do would be to grab all these pieces and make it a group in and of itself that way you can do stuff like take that rotate it up and then guess I don't have to put it back on the a I can put over here but there you go simple snowflake I could always come in here and do some stuff too like maybe go into one of these pieces and give a little bit of depth something like that might look kind of cool too yeah quick easy to make snowflake um actually when I did that I I uh realized there's some edges I still have so I'm going to come in here and uh shift erase whoops shift erase that edge as well and then actually add one here too one or two there we go and there we go quick and easy 3d snowflake from a single piece so if I come in here all that just came off of this one piece so yeah that was that was a pretty quick uh example quick quick model but uh it's the New Year we're just getting rolling again and uh I mean you guys are I'm trying to take it easy on you I'm not not go too advanced you know anything like that but I just want to show that and remind you of that I'm going to try to find and link to the original file so I would love to hear you guys uh you know your thoughts on the original thoughts on this let me know what you think of that first one and let me know if you've tried this if you've done this before uh this is a perfect example of how components work especially when you talk about mirror array and then uh you know flipping a component that kind of stuff but if you do it right it's less work to create more stuff and with repetitive jall like this makes it super easy to do if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment Down Below have you done this have do you remember the original video or do you have some other ideas totally unrated this you think could make good videos the the good good lessons we could show on our YouTube channel we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when the showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
