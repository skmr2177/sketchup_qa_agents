hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about tying section cuts to [Music] scenes so this was actually a request from you guys so we did a video a little while back talking about working scenes and that kind of thing and you guys asked several people actually asked how do I set up scenes that will actively turn my section cuts on and off so we're going to look at doing exactly that right now so I have a a model here it's just a a single just a building um a little bit of ground around there uh so what we're going to do is we're going to create a couple of scenes that are going to activate or deactivate section Cuts so we're going have two section Cuts one going the long way of the building one going the short way of the building and then we'll create scenes to let us flip between them quickly and easily so um the first thing I to do before I even mess with scenes I'm not even I have no scenes in here before I do anything with scenes I want to get my section Cuts in first so it's very important I want to make sure go and get both of these drawn and then start working on my scene so I'm going to go to section plane I'm going to put one here on this wall right here it's aligns with the green axis uh I'm going to call that one you can see I've been playing around this model so it it's automatically advancing my section cut we're just going to go Section cut one click okay and I'm going to use move just drag that in there I'm going to get to just in front of the stairs like right there perfect that's my first one that's the first uh plane I want to put on there or section cut excuse me me all right I'm going to do a second one tools go to section plane again and I'm put this one on the front wall lines of the red axis we'll call it section two that's awesome go ahead and move it pull that in here and we get about up to the information desk so right about about there perfect that's what I want so you can see when I drew that section that second section cut it deactivated the first only one can be active at the same time when they're both in the same context it's just kind of the way that uh that they work and that's fine that's going to work just fine for what we're doing so I'm going to go ahead and activate this first one the the longer cut and I'm going to go to view I'm going to go ahead and uh we'll actually grab both of these and hide them we don't need to see those all right so there we go so that's the cut I want to see so I'm going to come over to scenes I'm going to turn everything everything off except for active section planes and I'm going to turn everything off like that and I'm going to hit save or create or new plus hit plus and then create scene all right I'm going to call that not scene one but section one and now I want to turn on the other one so I'm going to go to view this is my I so I rarely as I'm working here I rarely ever if ever at all want to see my section planes right they're there they serve a purpose but I don't need to have those big floating planes so I almost always turn them off when I need to work with them I come to view I turn on hidden objects I do what I need to do in this case activate the other cut and then I can go to view and toggle hidden objects back off and now I'm back here so that's the thing that I tend to do that's how I tend to work with Section planes all right so now let's go in here and we'll go okay again with just active section planes turned down let's and create a new one rename this from scene to section all right there we go so now because this is connected not to camera location not to anything else I can flip between these two with the click of a button and move from one section plane to the other so that's a cool effect in everything but uh maybe as I'm working through here I don't necessarily want to wait for that transition to happen each time I can turn that off easy enough by going to view animation settings and just disabling enable seam transitions then it's just going to pop between the two boom boom so there you go pretty simple pretty easy to do but let's take that just a step further let's create a third scene where all the section planes are turned off so again I'm going to go to view temporarily turn hidden objects I'm going to right click and turn off the active cut turn that back off again and then we're going to save a third scene again with just active section planes turned on and I'm going to call that no sections move that one up to the top that makes sense like that okay so no sections boom section one boom section two back to no sections and I can just hop between them as I need and these these could be scenes that are you know for output something like that because we didn't save the camera with them they're really kind of more working scenes so as I'm going through here if there's you know if I wanted to work on the inside of the building didn't want to to turn a bunch of stuff off I could work in this scene and actually come in here and mess with the desk that kind of thing um same thing here oh I come in from a different side and work on this over here so it's really has to do more with creating working scenes here as opposed to Output scenes output scenes would be very similar but they' probably have camera location and maybe some other visibility stuff turned on whereas this is just to turn that section around or turn it off so there you go as requested Tye in sections to scenes seems pretty simple because it is um went by fast that was that was a quick one you guys I'm going to let you out early you get a couple minutes back in your day here this is great uh I do want to thank all the people who asked for this because like I said this was not a single request we had two or three people come up and ask can you do this can you add this uh we'll love that so if this triggers a thought for you is there's something else you're thinking of with sections or scenes or something like that if so let us know in the comments down below um and if you haven't already please do do like this video and if you didn't do that other thing go ahead and subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though going back to that comment thing leave us a comment down below uh we come up with ideas of what we think we would like to show you guys but nothing beats hearing from you what you think we should make we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
