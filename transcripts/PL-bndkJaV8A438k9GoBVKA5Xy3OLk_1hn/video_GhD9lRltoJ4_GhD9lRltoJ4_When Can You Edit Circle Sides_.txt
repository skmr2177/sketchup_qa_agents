hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about when you can and cannot edit the segments of a circle and [Music] SketchUp so I'm going to go ahead and say that I assume at this point uh you know enough about SketchUp or or you familiar with SketchUp sketchup's uh circles and arcs are made of segments um we'll talk about that real briefly but there are certain times in your modeling where you can actually change increase or decrease either the number of segments or the radius of the circle or Arc um after it's drawn so you can set it at first create it and you come back and make modifications to it there's certain geometry though when you go in and create it or add it uh it's going to prevent that from being able to be changed we're going to talk about what those what those blockers are right now all right so we're starting with an empty model here we got we got nothing so I'm going to do is I'm going to just tap C and draw in a default Circle so you can see the default down here 24 sides I'm just going to click and pull this out to some arbitrary Dimension and there we go got a circle all right I'm going to hit a and I'm do the same with an arc I'm going to click here then I'm going to click here and I'm just going to pull an arc out and there we go so now I have a circle and an arc default for a circle is 24 sides default for an arc is 12 sides that's what I've got drawn here now if I come in here and pick on the arc say over here under entity info I can actually see both the radius and the number of segments and I can come in here and I can edit them right so I can come here and say I actually want six sides when to hit enter it'll update that same thing for the radius I can come in here it's whatever 3 fo 7 3/4 so I'm going to say I want to be 3 foot even hit enter it'll shrink that perfect if I come over here when I pick a circle I do have to be careful because if I pick the face um it's just going to tell me the the square measurement of that face if I want to change the geometry of the actual Circle itself I do have to pick that edge the outside edge there it comes up tells me it's 24 sides and it's 12 foot or 2 foot 6 I'm going to go in and say okay I want this to be 12 sides you can see enter drops it down and I want to be 3T even so I'll just triple click 3 foot enter and there we go so so you see pretty easy editing now there are certain points where things are going to happen here um where I have to change where I can't change that anymore um there's some changes I can make that will be okay so if I come down here and I go um I'm just going to draw a couple edges to close this Arc in I can still select the arc at this point and change that so I can go back up to 12 enter and I can even change the radius so if I change it to 24 in it'll shrink down and the edges will pull along with it so there are certain times where I can still Oops I meant to go three foot undo a couple times things got too crazy there um so I can go through and I can make changes I can like just showed before whether this face is in here or not if I delete that click right here I can still come in and I can change that value um yeah so basic changing of that geometry from the start yeah I can edit that as much as I want now certain things are going to immediately prevent me from editing so for example here's a big one push pull if I push either of these up and come in here and select the edge I can change the radius so I can change the size but I can't change the number of segments same thing for the arc I come in here and change the radius but I can't change number of segments so that's one thing that happens that affects it now the cool thing is if I come in here and I get rid of this geometry right so I delete that we rid of all that delete that same thing over on the circle if I delete that and drag it back down so now it's just the shape on the ground again watch this if I pick this I'm back to editing both this the radius and the segments so I can change them again uh after that so it's not a per permanent breaking I can go in there I can modify a little bit you know I can I do a push pull bring it back down it still works again now let's show some other things so one one thing here is scale is a big one so if I have this circle selected and I come in and I click scale and I make this smaller watch watch my my UI over here when I let go ready let go it updates it so it's still 24 sides but it changed the radius because I actually changed the scale and it's going to watch that so it does update it and changing the scale does not prevent me from changing the number of segments all right now here's a fun one so let's take a line and I'm going to draw it all the way down here like this and then over on the arc I'm going to draw a line from right here just come out here so what I've done effectively is broken both my circle and my Edge with new edges or or my circle and my Arc with new edges so if I look at these two so these are two separate things you see what they're listed as in the in the properties over here is as an arc so in this Arc I'm going to tell to go uh 20 sides on one side and then the other side I'm going to take pick on it and say drop this one down to six and I can do that so this is still the geometry of the circle the radius of the circle but now I have two different number of of uh segs ments so over here same thing I'm going pick this one up to 10 enter and I'm going to grab this one and drop that down to three enter and I can do that now here's the fun part watch what happens when I delete this Edge and this Edge when I pick this it says oh yeah I recognize that that's a circle and look at my number of segments it tells me that my 20 plus my 6 is 26 they're not the same though it's kind of cool so so if I was to come in here and adjust this say I was to take this back to 24 it goes back it evenly distributes same thing with my arc when I pick the arc and it's 13 again 10 segments here and then another three here if I go put that back to 12 it's going to evenly distribute that put it back to 12 same thing um that is really cool that's F I actually did not know that that happened until I started making this video um because I'm a fan of pushing it I did this I'm going to show I'm going to show you exactly what I tested so if I draw something like that and uh let's say I do something like edit the size so let's grab this and make this a I don't know um 40in radius enter and then this one will make a 12 in radius okay that was extreme let's let's go a little let's go a little Tamer than that go to 24 so now I have two different arcs here if I come in here and I break this they don't heal that stays as two separate arcs same thing over here if I come grab this one this is now 3 fo6 I drop this down to 3 foot even if I erase that and I have two separate arcs it doesn't heal back together if I drop this one down to 3 foot even though the same that original break is too much for it so now it's separate pieces it will still individually I can still come in and and change either one of these so I come into this side and say drop that down to six segments but it's not going to heal back up with the other piece uh and you know become one piece ever again I broke it that's that's that's an all the way broken piece so um e I'm ending with this ugly ugly mess here I'm going to have to make sure the thumbnails pulled from the clean Circle and Arc that I have before and not this mess but there you go that is a look at the things you can do to both Circle and Arc geometry when you can edit when you can't and when it will heal itself and when it it won't you know I really like it when we make videos and the final thing that's on the screen is like the big win instead of here's what to do to make an ugly thing um but hey that's that's reality sometimes stuff gets ugly that's why command Z is so nice or control Z undo is such a good one um but there you go I've we've had lots of questions come up on the forums about that like uh people are asking all the time when you know why when I do this I edit it when I do this I can't and that was pretty much a list of the things that I could think of that would make something like that uneditable uh an arc or a circle number of sides um yeah if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below did I miss something is there a a a specific you can do and then go back and still edit those uh if so leave that down in the comments and if you have another idea or a question about SketchUp that you're not sure about leave that down in the comments as well we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
