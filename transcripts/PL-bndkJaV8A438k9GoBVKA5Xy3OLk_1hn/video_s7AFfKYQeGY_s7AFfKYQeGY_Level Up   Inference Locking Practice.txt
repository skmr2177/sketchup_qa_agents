hey y'all my name is Tyson and today is just going to be an inference locking practice session yeah so uh nothing Earth shattering today I'm going to take an example that we have in our SketchUp campus course and we have a course on inference locking if you're not familiar with it so you can learn the basics and then we have this example we're going to look at which is uh building this roof using inference locking and we're just going to do it kind of differently than we do in that session some will be the same some not but it's just a a a way to practice a technique in this case inference locking I find Sometimes the best thing to do is just give yourself a challenge limit yourself to say just the pencil and the move tool and see what you can get done that's kind of what this is all about about so let's jump in um in the example file we I we have these two um blocks this is the finished example file then this is where you start from and in the campus course one of the things that uh we do is use uh for example the protractor tool to help create some of these angles and uh build from there I think this time let's just recreate some of this because we have this let's just build over here um using information that we have here just as again it's just a different way than we do it in the campus course but it's still good practice so I know that this for example starts at the midpoint this line let's start here so I'm going to start a line draw in the blue Direction and and I'm going to hold the shift key to lock again if you're not familiar with inference locking please see some of our other videos or our campus course but I'm going to lock and then click here to get the correct height and then I will just simply draw down and then from here I will draw across lock the green Direction which I could also do with the arrow keys click here and then that one was easy to finish now I'm going to you know recreate this part of the roof so I'm going to hover on this Edge and hold the shift key now I'm locked to that edge so I'm going to start my drawing my point from somewhere on this Edge I'm still holding the shift key and I'm going to hover on this point click and that's starts from that point now where is this going to go to well I'll hover over this surface lock to that surface so again I'm holding the shift key and then I'm going to come over here again referencing our model and you can see it snaps where that surface and that edge would would align and then I will hold down here again lock that Edge and find where that surface should meet up okay so just using inference locking uh locking to existing points or uh existing surfaces so I should be able to erase that I use the move tool here I can move this back again lock that green Direction and lock it to here from here we could draw this red Edge in but we don't know how far far now obviously I could just copy this Edge measure it do something like that but let's continue our inference locking practice um and we should be able to learn what this is by recreating some of this geometry here so we can again find the midpoint draw in the blue Direction maybe I'll tap the up Arrow key and lock it to there so we know that height is correct in fact we could use the move tool move that back tap the left Arrow key to lock the green Direction and so we know that's correct too now from here I'm going to just draw this Edge in because that will give us the correct surface angle the same as this one and then I can start a line hover here for example lock to that edge so I'm holding the shift key and then as I hover over this surface it's going to jump to that point alternatively I could also do the exact opposite where I just hover over this surface find that blue on face hold the shift key so it's locked and then move up to the surface doing the same thing uh not surface this Edge but again just using inference locking locking two edges and two surfaces now will finish that one out and this roof should be done we can just add in a few edges here and we should be able to oh you can see what I've done there is I did not draw this Edge back so in fact this surface is not correct but we're just going to fix that really quick I will draw this Edge lock to the green to here do the same thing we just did but this time I've got that little bit of an edge so I'll lock to this surface find this and that should be what we needed and that's a that I mean that's perfect that's the point right we're trying to recreate this using inference locking had a little bit of a mistake so we could also fix it with inference locking um this part let's will be a mix of using some of the techniques that we use in the campus course and maybe some of these references over here I want to start this Edge now a simple way to do that is I could simply select this Edge use the move tool and move a copy lock that blue Direction and move it up but let's say we're trying to restrict ourselves to the line tool so instead I will hover over this Edge hold the shift key to lock that or the up arrow and then hover up here on the surface click somewhere there and that will start that edge from where that edge and that surface meet then I'll find the red Direction and lock it and instead again in the campus course we use the protractor to create some of these angles but we're just going to use so I'll lock the blue Direction to find the height here and do the same here and here now that I have that I could lock it there now that's one um we can build some of this out differently so let's uh start an edge let's say from here lock it and then again find back here to where it meets up which is actually should be the same as this wall and then we can hover the blue Direction because we're right now we're up in the air and find where it meets the surface we're creating just that small Edge now here this should be interesting we don't have all the information over here yet and I'm not sure if we'll get it but let's we we do know a couple things we know this uh is one nice surface so let's start here let's just say I'm going to draw out here some distance I don't know how far yet and then move up in the blue direction we do know that we want that to be the ridge line now we don't know exact L where it is at this point but we do know that if we create this surface back here so I'll use the green Direction lock both of those to the surface so if we create that that should give us the ability to keep going and I'm trying to think of what we need to do is create a surface here that will find I'm wondering if I have enough information because I I know from this the course this is 30 degrees and um well we have this actually this should help us we know from the course that we want the other side to line up here so I'm just going to hover and that's as far as that goes now we don't know quite where this midpoint is yet but we do know that we can pull this edge up this far then find the green Direction now the protractor tool would all we need to do is use the protractor tool to find that 30Â° angle and that would give us all the rest of the information we need um I'm trying to think of could we still get away without using the protractor [Music] tool sometimes and probably we could I'm trying to think in real time here and I think at this point it would be simpler just to to use it in there um oh you know what we can do uh this will seem obvious to some of you but I didn't now that we have this Edge we simply need to lock here and find out where this would come over in the red direction right that's all we need is that point right there we bring that forward and that will give us the rest of the information so that um it's arbitrary it's not how you would build a typical roof the whole point of that was just to say can we build this roof that in our campus course we built using the protractor and some known angles in our case can we build the same thing trying not to use the the protractor tool and using just the line tool and inference locking and we use the move tool a little bit um challenge yourself to do that from time to time just to see if you can push your knowledge of inference locking or other techniques farther than you have in the past little exercises like that okay that was that was pretty straightforward and I apologize I was sort of fumbling around a little bit but the truth is I thought let me go into this unprepared and we'll go through it together because again that's the point it's just an exercise where you sort of work through it and be like if I restrict myself to certain tools what can I still do based on the information I have a useful challenge again for just sort of building out some of those techniques please uh try it on your own just create some of your own examples let us know you know what you think or or if you have different ideas on how this could be done then uh challenge yourself to do so as always leave us your feedback we'd love your your comments and your suggestions especially for future videos or or techniques that we can cover ideas that we can explore uh we love to have that dialogue with you and otherwise if you're not subscribed to our YouTube Channel please do so for we release this stuff out on a very frequent basis so come back keep learning we'll see you next time thanks [Music] y'all [Music]
