hey everybody Eric here and today I want to share with you how to use and create custom keyboard shortcuts in order to speed up your workflow here in [Applause] SketchUp so if you're not already doing it using keyboard shortcuts is a great way to be efficient while modeling what it does is it frees up just that uh Split Second that it takes to find an icon or a tool from a drop- down menu and allows you to do it instantly by just tapping a key where your hands are naturally resting anyway so there's a couple different ways to do that um we're going to go over both using default shortcuts so ones that are already there for our basic drawing tools but also how to take it a step further and create your own custom shortcuts and of course I'm going to share with you my favorite ones and why so let's get to it so here I am in SketchUp I've got my you can see my hand here which is is going to rest on the left side of my keyboard we're going to use that in just a second I've also got on the screen you can see when I type a key it shows up on the screen so not only are you seeing what I'm doing with my hands but you can see how it shows up on the screen so first thing I want to do before I get rid of our trusty little toolbar here I want to show you that if you don't already know about keyboard shortcuts if you hover over one like for example the circle tool it says C for Circle and then if you come over here here and you hover over one you might see e for erase so for example if you're used to just finding the circle tool and clicking on it there you go there's your circle now the same way you can do that hover over it it says C that's telling you that's C on the keyboard so C there's my circle and there you go of course if you've once you memorized all the basic ones you can use go beyond C and go over to P for Push Pull f for offset P for push pull again select everything and then command or contrl G for group and there you go you can see I've got a little fireplace for my deck and that was done without looking for any tools at all so let's go ahead and just get rid of for now let's just get rid of that toolbar I'm going to I just left that up so that you could see that if you're not sure already what the keyboard shortcuts are you can go ahead and just hover over any of these and it will tell you what they are so don't need that I'm going to delete that um yeah so let's close that out so let's talk about some of these other keyboard shortcuts those are the default ones so your basic tools uh are the drawing tools like L for line most of those make sense and so I'm not going to cover those those are pretty basic but I do want to look at some other ones really quick and why why are these ones my favorite I've put a little shortcut list in case I forget here off to the side so the first one I want to look at is paste in place so if you know here that you've got something like I've got this lady here I can copy and paste but by default the paste function pastes at the cursor often times I want to copy and then maybe I want to delete and I want to go inside of a group and I want to paste her but I want to paste her not over here and I have to place her but I want to paste her exactly in the same place now normally I would come up here and go up and go edit paste in place but that just takes a little takes my attention away from what I'm doing so I have a keyboard shortcut which is instead of command or control V for paste it's shift V so that's paste in place so I'm going to do that again I'm going to delete her get out of that group shift V paste her right back in place where she was now I like that I use that a lot it's one of my favorites paste in place and we're going to look at in a second how to create your own keyboard shortcuts we'll wrap up by actually creating some new ones together in case you're not sure how to do that but let me show you a few more helpful ones and before we um before we wrap up that way uh the other thing is hide now I you can rightclick and say hide uh or you can set a keyboard shortcut for it so I tend to not use keyboard shortcuts for things that I can get on the right click menu so there was a a time where I actually had hide as a keyboard shortcut but I find that if it's in the rightclick menu it's just as fast for me to do it that way so I did want to point out that hide uh is actually in the right click so to me you could set a shortcut for it or you know you can go ahead and hide it that way we're going to have to unhide her in just a second but we'll get there we're going to go down the list so looking around um you can see I'm navigating the model by orbiting but sometimes I want to like hold that viewpoint but I want to be able to see the top of my cabin so I'm going to hit shift e and shift e is because I think of it an eyeball so e makes me it easy for me to remember that if I want to use my eye to look around I can hit shift e and what it does is it locks that camera position and so when I move my mouse I'm just uh I'm just looking around from that Viewpoint so that's pretty cool why shift it's because e has already been taken by the Eraser tool so if I just hit e that's erase I don't want to do that I hit shift e and that shift just reminds me that that's a custom keyboard shortcut that I'm setting up so that one's really helpful Zoom extents So speaking of looking around sometimes I'm in my model and I'm you know doing something like a little edit down here to this glass and I get stuck and I get I don't know where I am I'm in inside of the model or I'm inside of a wall and I just kind of instead of backing all the way out I can just hit shift Z and that's Zoom extents so that's Zoom zooming zooming all the way out to the extent of the model so another one that I like to do is adding scenes shouldn't be that difficult now if you have your scenes panel up you can open up the scenes panel and add one that way but if you have no scenes like I have no scenes here so I don't really want to go wind window scenes add a new scene in this case I have a keyboard shortcut for adding scenes it's just shift a and that's so I can remember shift add a scene so there's my scene there it is if I want to do another one I can rotate around and shift a rotate around shift a it's just a really fast way to add scenes it's by using keyboard shortcuts and there they are they're all there that's pretty cool so the next one on my list is hidden geometry that I use all the time so often times especially when you're working with curved surfaces and things where the faces are hidden for example uh if I go and look at these chairs if I wanted to select something or delete a line or hide a line sometimes it's difficult so what I'll hit is J on the keyboard there's no shift on that one because if you think uh sketchup's default shortcut for showing back edges is K so if you wanted to see back edges you could hit k um so I just thought well if I'm going to show my hidden edges I'm just going to do that next to K which is J so I'm seeing my hidden geometry and that looks good so I'm actually happy with those I'll just turn that off hit J again so J is cool because it toggles hidden geometry both on and off so that's hidden geometry speaking of hidden geometry now it's similar to Hidden geometry but it's hidden objects like if I went in here speaking of hidden objects I have I have a woman here that I hid my scale figure so if I turn my hidden geometry on you can see she doesn't show up she's a group so she's an object so I have n here don't know why n is random just that's what I just assigned was n for hidden objects maybe it was hidden you know n and then I can come over here and right click and say unhide so there she is so she's back so that's pretty cool so hidden objects is n hidden geometry is J maybe if you spelled geometry wrong that's why I use J so that's that one so that takes me to section planes and this is a relatively new one for me I used to always come up here and go tools and I come over section plane and then I go View and I say show section planes and then I go view show a cut that took me a little while so instead I just whenever I have a section I just shift T and shift t for me says toggle I want to toggle my section plane on so there it is it's inside of my group and then when I want to show the section I would hit shift s so shift s shows the section so that's that's why I did an s and that's really cool because while I'm modeling I can always just be turning turning both the plane on or off I wanted to view the plane I could show it or not show it and then if I wanted to show the section I could show it or not show it using just keyboard shortcuts and that one is really one that I picked up recently and I think has really helped me quite a bit I really actually enjoy working with um I didn't mean to move my whole section I meant to go inside my group there we go so I can toggle that turn the plane off see how that looks that looks good so I'll go ahead and turn that section off anyway yeah that one's been tremendously helpful for me so let's see here that takes us pretty much to my last one now there's always more to add there's always tons everyone's got their own way of working so remember this is just kind of a starting list of things that I find useful for me but um another one is x-ray style I've been this is a new one for me I do use x-ray a lot so I hit X on my keyboard shortcut and that's going to get me X-ray and that's not too difficult to come up here to my toolbar where I could just click the face style myself but again it's just I'm just trying to push myself to use keyboard shortcuts more and more and more so you'll notice when I modeling now when I model I pretty much don't use any of the tools from the large tool palet and other than sometimes where I will you know pick a standard view or change my face style I'll still use those from the tool palette um but for the most part those ones are actually not too difficult for me to get rid of if I wanted to get rid of using those I can do standard views I can shift my camera if I wanted to go to parallel projection I could switch between perspective and parallel projection if I wanted to add a keyboard shortcut for that and flip through my standard views so that's really cool um there's really just almost nothing that you can't turn into a keyboard shortcut So speaking of turning it into let's wrap up by coming over here to preferences hopefully you've stayed with me this long under shortcuts which is third from the bottom in your preferences you can just type something in here so if I wanted to say face style uh let's see I wanted to create a shortcut for hidden line style so this would be a toggling on the hidden line face style so I might come over here and go sh shift H it says actually uh you've already assigned shift h H2 um it's an extension which is hiding edges well I can decide whether I want to keep that for the original shortcut that I created or say no I don't really use that one very often I'm going to replace that one so let's replace that so when I'm in my model I've got a new shortcut shift H and that's hidden line style so again I don't even need to come up here and go view face style uh I don't even know where face style is anymore there it is because I don't use it and I'm hidden line you can see I'm toggling between my hidden line so that is super super super cool and I just love keyboard shortcuts I really hope that um I really hope that this was useful so that's it I encourage everyone this is maybe not something for beginners if you're just starting with SketchUp go over to SketchUp campus learn the basic tools first um but as soon as you kind of understand the layout how SketchUp Works go right into starting with keyboard shortcuts trust me it's going to save a lot of time not only that but but it's just I for me it's just a more fun way to use SketchUp and um yeah it's just common it's just a second nature now so I'll leave you there I'll say thanks as always let me know I would love to keep this conversation going um what is your favorite keyboard shortcut or I was thinking maybe three or four if you want to name not just one but what keyboard shortcuts did I not cover that are essential to your workflow let me know in the comments below and I'll respond so we'll keep that conversation going give us a like comment share or subscribe while you're at it and I will say thank you and see you next [Music] time
