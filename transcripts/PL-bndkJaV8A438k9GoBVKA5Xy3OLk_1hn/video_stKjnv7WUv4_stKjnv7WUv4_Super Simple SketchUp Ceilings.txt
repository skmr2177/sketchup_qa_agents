hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to take a look at modeling some ceilings so this came up we did a a a video a couple weeks ago about making ceiling plans inside of layout and that was for like vaulted ceilings on uh on roofs and that kind of thing but the question came well how do we frame down ceilings how do we model ceilings that come down um like you'd see in a basement or or something like that how do we go about that process and I figured well let's do that let's let's let's answer that question by by doing it let's in fact let's do it right now let's stop talking go all right so I have a very very simple room here this is just a little little pretend basement room and I got some duct work or some steel beams or whatever there's stuff up here that drops the assumption is of course that there's another floor you know up above this and and this is the place we're in so I didn't have that in there because I like being able to look down from above but in this situation how would we come in and just frame down so that we're underneath here um I'm going to get rid of this because I don't I don't need to see that so really I want to what I want to look at is okay if I drop a line down I'm going to hold down the shift to lock that so this is about 10 in so I'm going to say I want to drop down at least 12 in to frame some kind of a ceiling here there's a couple options what we could do we could actually do something that is framed down so as long as there's like you know an inch and a half for some flat Tu by members and then a half inch of drywall so if I come down if I came down 12 Ines I could actually do that pretty easy so this could be as simple as this I could come down 12 in typ 12 enter and then from there I could just kind of come across here cross here cross here and you know what with that if we're looking for the MVP the minimum viable product the least possible work that would work right that gives us uh a ceiling plane I'd probably want to grab this group it um I'm going to go into my tags and and make some stuff I'm going to put in a few ceiling layers ceiling one and then whoops I didn't hit enter ceiling one enter ceiling 2 enter and we'll do a third one and we'll call this one ceiling five ah kidding ceiling three okay so I'm going to take this minimum ceiling and we're just going to assign that to ceiling one and then I can turn that off like that so that works that's not a bad solution that is that that's going to be you know you know that could be how I put that in um let's look at some other options so let's say I do want to frame it down maybe I want to put some volume in or like recess some lighting this this stuff right here does cause an issue for me obviously I can't frame into where this beam or the HVAC is but I could create a volume that I can play in a little bit by doing something more like this so if I come in here and I'm just going to draw an edge across we're going to come down to 12 in same same depth for the ceiling 12 in and go like that and then I could push this back here like this what this gives us is rather than just that one plane this gives us a volume right so we could actually do some stuff inside of here so if I wanted to I could come in and do something like um you know I'm going to put a rectangle like that and then push that maybe all the way up to the top or we'll go we'll go up like 11.5 there we go and I could give myself that little recess right so I could I could actually have a little Vault a little higher space up there and to take that a little bit further as well I could even grab this I'm going to bring this down like 8 in select and delete that and then we'll pull these out like I don't know 3 in something like that and what that will do that gives me just a little you know like a little lighting recess so I could in that volume I could actually have you know I it wouldn't sketch up doesn't Place lights but I could go into my render or something and put a put a a lighting a light across those spots which would put light up into that recess and kind of make that section glow but pretty easy to do one of the things I might want to do if I'm playing with this I arbitrarily drew a rectangle but obviously I'd want to be more if I want to be more specific I could work in x-ray mode too cuz then I can actually see how close am I to this so if I'm framing down and if I want to get the most possible volume I could take you know these two pieces and just pull them this direction a little bit closer there so same thing here grab that slide it back like that and this is give me my biggest possible uh space right there that one actually no it actually didn't click to it so turn x-ray off there we go I got my biggest possible space I might maybe want to give myself a little another couple of inches or something like this like bring this another three inches out little little more space for lighting in that ledge and uh with that obviously I didn't frame that we didn't go in and figure out exactly how it's going to go together but um the general idea I think should make sense there and the fact that this volume covers up the other materials that's fine that doesn't that doesn't hurt anything uh it just gives us more space space to to kind of work in there so I'm going to go ahead and make that a group and assign that to ceiling 2 now there is one other uh one other thing we want to look at uh it's not the most popular but it does happen a lot and if you're creating an existing space you may have to mess with a drop ceiling so if I was doing a drop ceiling here's what I would do um I come in with a rectangle draw 25 4X 48 cuz that's a a standard size of a a ceiling uh drop ceiling acoustical tile um and let's see we'll give that like a half inch I actually don't know how one inch I don't know I don't exactly how no that's not right either 3/4 of an inch I don't know now now I'm messing with details that don't really matter that much I'm going to take that and make it a component um I'm just going to call it my top I'm going to take that and we're going to stick it right here and then pull it down 12 in get us to that same ceiling height we have before all right now I'm going to take that piece option copy this way and then I'll say I don't know four times all right we'll grab that whole run right there take it option copy over here and then we'll go do that I don't know 12 times that nail it nope a it's close I was like you're not going to believe I'm winging this if I get the guest right both directions all right so there that gives us our tiles now in some cases that might be good I might be like yeah cool that's fine um but anybody who's done or dealt with this knows that there's an important piece missing and that's the track that those acoustic tiles sit in so I may want to I say may because this again is is all about level of detail what is the appropriate level of detail um and of course you're going to want to model the level of detail that makes sense for your model so I'm going to draw this little little 1 in by an eighth of an inch rectangle I'm going to extend it all the way down to the opposite wall going to grab that make that into a component actually I'm not make it a component I'm just going to make it a group I don't need to uh I got I got an issue with my clicking all right there we go right make a group I'm not going to repeat this or it's going to repeat but not there's no reason to sync them together so do that and then say 1 two 3 four five six 78 8 x that gives me half my grid the other pieces so I do need pieces around the edge so I'm going to come in here come over half an inch actually we'll say one inch this way to and then same thing I'll drop down actually you know why am I doing that let's just let's just do this take this and we'll just option copy this over here same thing on the end this is a little different because this is a full piece uh so my spacing is a little off right because this is now a half inch smaller than than one in but still works all right and then I need some going this way so same thing I'm going to start I flipped upside down here I'm going to come this way 0 five I could try to grab uh an existing piece and scale it and make it work the right right you know size and everything but for me just drawing that rectangle and push pulling it real quick is a way quicker easier way to do that I know it's a little Brute Force but still all right then we going to make a group there and then I'm going to say option copy this way and that is 3x and grab all of those and we're going to go here to here 8X go and then this last row I'm going to grab all of these and I'm going to scale them now I'm going to turn on X Rus the inside of here and then I can go to zoom in kind of tight there it is I'm just going to pull that out to here now it's scaled the right size turn X off and now before I do anything else while it's still selected I'm just going to hit move and that's going to let me option copy that right over to this right here because these are shorter too and then the last thing I have to do is grab a row of those actually the way this would work would be I would have one more of these so let's go oops let's go vertical take this piece option rotate it this way that runs this way and then these actually what'll happen is all of these pieces if we're trying to get it right look look as right as possible without overlapping geometry I hate when geometry just slightly overlaps and causes issues so if I look down here it's exactly what I got going on see that so I'm going to hit scale I'm going to turn X-ray on again so I can see inside the wall and I'm just going to grab that middle handle pull that so it hits the face of this other whoops whoa I got kind of crazy with my zoom I apologize wouldn't make anybody sick there right and I'm just going to pull that back to having a hard time getting that there we go and with that we have our third type of ceiling which we can also grab I don't need the ceiling stuff uh make that into a new group assign that group to ceiling three and there we go with that we got a drop ceiling frame down ceiling with a lighting Nook I don't know what that's actually called but a vaulted or a tray ceiling raised up ceiling there or the super simple just a face any of them work and uh here you go see how easy that quick and easy it is to actually just put one of those in there um yeah I know it's kind of when you think about it it's pretty basic modeling nothing I did there was like exceptional or difficult or anything like that but there is something inherently uh challenging about modeling a thing from underneath I don't know why that is maybe it's because you flip it over and it looks backwards I I don't know what it is but I maybe I'm just talking for myself too I used to struggle with modeling ceilings because it was always like I had to stop and just think like reverse I don't know maybe I'm making it more difficult than I have to but really it's pretty simple to model that geometry it's really a question of the right level of detail you need for the job you're doing and the right geometry and organizing um pretty simple grouping pretty pretty simple tagging and uh you can have some options in just a couple of minutes if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below uh did you like that do you have to model like that did I miss something is there a thing that I should have done differently or do you have an idea for a video something we've never showed before let us know down in the comments we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
