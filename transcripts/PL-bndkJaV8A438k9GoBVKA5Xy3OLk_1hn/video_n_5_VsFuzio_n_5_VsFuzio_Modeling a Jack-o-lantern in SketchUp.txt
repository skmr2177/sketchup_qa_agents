hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to carve some [Music] pumpkins so we've done videos on this if you're a longtime follower of our Channel we have done Jacko lanterns in the past but it's just such a good learning example um right off time I there's like over a dozen different concepts and tools youed native tools that are used uh to make these so it's a great thing to practice if you haven't done this before and you're' seen us for the first time watch this and then go back and do your own and uh yeah let me know how it goes let's do it let's car some Jack lanterns all right so first thing I'm going to do is uh I'm going to draw an edge from here up to here just to kind of figure out exactly how tall I want my Jack L to be compared to you know a Teddy size then I'm going to grab my arc I'm going to go top to bottom and I'm gonna pull that out I'm G to go past a half circle so I get a little bit extra bulge because uh what this is going to be this is the profile of the pumpkin pumpkins kind of do this thing where they they kind of pull back in at the stem and at the you know anti-stem what whatever the this piece is here the bottom of the pumpkin so that's a pretty good shape to begin with I'm going to delete this Edge I drew and I'm going to start with a new Circle my circle I want to to be parallel to the red axes and it's going to be that big is I'm sorry if these are not accurate enough values I I don't have exact numbers I'm working with I'm work I'm doing organic shapes here you know so I'm going to grab this Arc follow me with the circle I'm going to get a a noodle a a a macaroni an elbow noodle there we go and I'm going to grab that there's a reason I started off of the axes and here's why right here uh I want to turn this noodle this direction actually a copy of it so I'm hit my modifier key to copy and I going to rotate at 15Â° and I want to do that 2x there we go now what I want to do with these intersecting noodles is get just this face out of here I don't really care about all the rest of pieces I just want this selection this chunk right here so I'm going to right click intersect face and intersect with model that's going to break it and now I'm going to grab it option move it out here I'm not going to try to go in and erase these other pieces I'm just going to grab the piece I want get rid of the rest and then take this and put it back On the Origin now what I can do is I can rotate this from here modifier key to copy again to here and I'm going say 24x and there we go now I got a solid pumpkin CH it's a big pumpkin I did not realize quite how big a pumpkin I was making um not a big deal because I can always select it all and just do a quick scale down uh but not yet because I want to keep this on the origin soon as I scale it's going to move off the origin all right so I'm going to grab triple click this and I'm going to make it into a group now what we have right here is great it's a great start and actually if I was making a pumpkin I'd throw a stem on this thing and call it done but because I want to make a jack a' Lantern means I'm going to want to cut this thing into pieces so what I'm going to do is I'm going to scoot this this uh section plane over and just kind of peek in here and see what we got so right now it's empty cool that's fine that's good that's what it should be but I'm sorry I don't need you anymore Teddy thank you for your help I'm going to grab this pumpkin or just the the group I have here I'm going to edit copy and I'm going to say edit paste and place now with that new copy I'm going to hit scale I'm hit the modifier key to scale about the center and I'm going to scale that second one in like this so basically what I'm creating is a wall see that now I have thickness but it's not there yet I'm going to hide this section cut so I can come play inside of here cuz I'm going to take this pumpk in this group right here double click in here select all of this and reverse faces so now when I look at it I should see white on the inside white on the outside and in the in between pieces this is the solid part it should be gray that looks perfect before I get rid of my section though I going to throw some color on here I'm going to hit my paint bucket tool to get my my uh Mac only colored pencils up I'm sorry Windows users this is a Mac thing you'll have the normal swatches and stuff I'm going to color the outside orange I'm going to color the inside yellow there we go so now when I cut through uh actually that's not going to work I just colored the outside I just colored the containers I'm going to come in here select a select all color it perfect come in here command a yellow inside I want to color the F faces faces the faces and not the groups of course all right I can get rid of the section cut that's new I didn't know section cut materials wouldn't get cut huh I learned something new today all right Let's uh let's fill the rest of that in there that was kind of fun look at that all right so I will be doing a uh video later on about working with sections because of that you learned it here all right let's throw a stem on here real quick for my stem I'm going to go to my polygon just do a a six-sided polygon and I'm just going to pull it out about that big I'm GNA make it a little bit of height like that and then uh I'm gonna option bring another piece up and we grab that and scale that down about the middle push pull another piece and then we'll take that one and rotate it like this and then push pull that out something like that um I don't need a lot of detail in the stem I know this looks a little low poly um and I know that I just probably create an extra face inside here I'll delete that one should be the only one all right looks good uh and then I'm going to close that face back up there we go select it all color it dark green and make it a group actually thing I want to do is I to select it all again and soften it real quick because I don't need those those hard edges there we go let me take that over stick that you know on the top down and then this is why I like this method modeling is cuz you know it's an organic thing there's no perfect way to do it I can move stuff around all right that's looking pretty good um one thing I am going to want to do is I'm want to take both the inside and the outside group so I can grab with a group select get both of them make that into a new group and come in here and explode both of them what that's doing is taking my inside shell and my outside shell and putting them together to create a hollow solid so if I click on this it still says solid group but it has that inside and outside still that's important when I carve The Jackal Lantern of course which I'm going to do right now let's go back to a polygon let's do a three-sided polygon I'm going to pull this up like that make a triangle copy that triangle right over let's make another triangle for a nose there a little smaller triangle and then I'm going to do an arc let come down from here I'm being I'm being way too precise right now I mean when you go carve a jackal Lantern you Wing things you're carving uneven shapes on an uneven surface um I like I like I like ugly teeth on my Jackal Lantern there we go oh beautiful all right there we go classic Jackal Lantern face I'm going to take each of these pieces and make them tall like that grab all of that make it a group we can then take that rotate it like this and we'll slide it over slide it forward forward so it's sticking out of the pumpkin a a more or less front view here get that again I don't want to get it centered perfectly so much cuz I'm trying to make it look like a you know it's a jack liner it's a little bit off maybe and then we're going to cut it I'm going to hit tap X just to check x-ray green a little bit I want to make sure it cuts through both the inside and the outside faces but doesn't cut through the back wall that's perfect now this is a solid group this is a solid group this has multiple pieces but it will all cut at once using solid tools turn x-ray off but when I go in and hit subtract is the is the the command I'm going to use to cut this out of the pumpkin it's going to leave spaces between the inside face and the outside face of the pumpkin those faces are going to be whatever material is on this geometry so I'm going to select all this geometry I'm going to grab my orange I'm going to edit it a little bit I'm going to go a little bit darker almost a brownish color it's a stylistic choice I know you could you could make an argument for a lighter orange the inside the pumpkin but I want some contrast between the inside and the outside so I'm going to use that brownish color I'm going to take that go to tools I'm go to solid tools I'm to subtract there we go click it's a lot of intersecting so take a second and there we go and see how why I picked my dark I like how it makes that the yellow the shining through pop out a little bit and with that we have ourselves a Jacko Lantern good job so I apologize this is absolutely an intermediate uh tutorial if you're brand new to SketchUp I recommend you hop over to SketchUp campus learn. sketchup.com run through the fundamentals and then come back and a lot of the stuff we just ran through will make more sense um odds are good if it was too hard and too complicated you already dropped out by now and maybe you left a comment that said I can't do this is too hard I'm sorry I thought of you just not till now so uh but if you did follow along and you did make a jack a' Lantern we'd love to see it so uh yeah post it up on Instagram or Facebook and tag SketchUp official uh so we can we can see that show up or head over to our forum forums. sketchup.com and share it there get it to us we just want to see your pumpkin we don't really care how we get it uh if you like that video click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe we put out a lot of video content around here and you'll be notified of all of it if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below uh did you learn something specific with this video is there a new workflow or feature that you didn't know about that you now have uh do you have an idea for a future video let us know any of that down in the comments we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
