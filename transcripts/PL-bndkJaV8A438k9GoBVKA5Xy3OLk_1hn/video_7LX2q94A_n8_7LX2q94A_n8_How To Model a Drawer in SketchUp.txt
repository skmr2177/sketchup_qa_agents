hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to take a look at modeling a drawer this was a request that came up during a live stream we asked if you know what thing should we model and somebody mentioned a drawer we've talked about we've done a couple videos in the past where we've done you know doveet tails and how to model pieces of wood that fit together but we've never done a comprehensive thing like this so um it's going to go a little bit quick so if you want to go into more Det detail on like the doveet taals or individual pieces I recommend checking those out on our YouTube page otherwise we're going hop in model drawer all right so here's here's the thing we're going to model so uh it's uh we got a bottom right here and then the four pieces that make out the uh outside of the drawer and then a front piece on here so we're going to model all that out of these two things these are just rectangles that's right I drew rectangles so I drew a rectangle and this is I think like a E8 inch uh tall rectangle right here yeah and then over here I think I have a/ inch piece yeah and then that is what four inches tall something like that okay there we go pretty simple so first thing we're going to do is we're going to take this piece right here and we're going to cut a Groove for this to go into so I'm going to come into context I'm going to come in here I'm going to come up I don't know an eth of an inch 316 something like that I'm going to come in an eighth of an inch up an eighth of an inch so just a 8 in square basically right on the side there and we'll just cut that through there we go so now what that lets me do is let's let's that sit right there so we're going it's moving into that slot right there Perfect all right now what we're going to do is we're going to make some doveet Tails so the way we're going to do this is we're going to come into the end piece here and I'm going to work I want to evenly divide this into multiple pie pieces I'm going to work off this outside edge rather than the Inside Edge because the Inside Edge is now short because I made this cut I could have done this first and cut that afterwards but I didn't so I'm going to select this Edge and I'm going to say divide I'm going to divide it to like an odd number so we'll say like seven segments perfect and then uh yeah I'm going to do this and then what I'll do is I'll come in here and I'll grab this point and I'll drop it down like that and then this one will come up there we go and I'll take that and I will option copy it from this point or option move to copy to there and we'll say do that two times there we go now I can do is just take that and I'll push that in we'll push that in 1/2 of one in all three awesome and now we need to do is we need to actually copy that same geometry onto the other side so there's several different ways I could go about this I'm going to do quick and dirty modeling right here so first thing I'm doing is I'm going to come up here I'm going to view I'm going to component edit hide rest of model I don't need to see the rest of everything else in the world as I do this so quick and easy I don't have this set to exact length right now so it's just kind of a piece of wood so I can say grab this option mirror like that and just grab that delete it and then we'll go turn edit hide similar components or hide rest model off and then I can grab oops grab the edge of the window and not the uh geometry I want to move going grab this geometry right here and we'll move it back that the same thing here grab that geometry slide it back there we go so now I got that my ends of my drawers are done so I can do now is I can say we'll just mirror again along the middle of this piece of wood right here got those two ends now I need a piece to come out and fill this in now I did not do this very well because if I had been plan planning ahead I would have copied that original piece because uh you can see this piece is not going to work at all but fortunately I'm pretty good at cleaning up my own messes so if I just double click like that then I can go there we go cleaned up again um I have in the past teased Tyson who does some of our live models for leaving what I call a graveyard of parts and and he always tells me that that's very useful because if you have a graveyard AP parts then you can always go back to a previous piece and uh well I'll be he does seem to be correct all right so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to trace the cutouts like that and then I will push those back try gock click this one's being weird because if I hide the rest of my model real quick see what's happening there is because I got that little piece right there so uh I'll have to clean that up like this not a big deal pretty easy to fix and I'm going to do the same thing I did before so I'm just going to grab all this geometry I'm going to say mirror it and I'm going to option mirror it right here just select and delete delete those lines in the middle it's going to make it all one piece now if I come back out it's looking pretty good but it's got some issues we got issues so let's start we'll show the rest of the model and I will grab this drop this back oh perfect so I got good good- looking dovetails right here what I don't have is it's not in the right place right everything is off because that's the that's my bottom and it's poking through and it shouldn't be so uh I found that one way to deal with this kind of stuff is to temporarily turn on x-ray tap X on your keyboard you'll get X-ray up and then I can see exactly where I want this to be I want this to pull back to Here There we go now all of our pieces are sitting inside the rail perfect and grab this one mirror that option to the middle of this board right here that looks good of course this is in the wrong spot two now so what I got to do is take this piece and move it how far out are we I bet we're exactly a/ inch away from being where we're supposed to be so let's try that let's pull it out like this let's see no 3/4 of an inch obviously all right last step then is to just grab these pieces right here and we can just pull them straight out like this and then over here I didn't make this a component that could have saved me some time cuz i' I would have only had to change one and there we go there's the base base part of our drawer the last thing we I stuck on this drawer over here was a a just kind of a a front uh this would be the decorative piece so I can do that same thing here I'm going to hit rectangle and I'm going to hit the draw from Center option so on on uh Mac that's the option key and I'm going to do is I'm going to find the middle of this bring that over find the middle of this bring that down and there we go and what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw a rectangle like that and pull that out say half an inch then I can pull each of these sides up like this quick and easy modeling this is if I don't I mean if I had if I'm working from a set of plans where I have exact measurements obviously this be a little easier uh I'm going to pull that out half an inch on each side click click and then I made kind of a a front here all I did was grabb it and we'll offset uh yeah I'll say 38 of an inch and 38 of an inch again and then I'll grab this piece and I will move it forward so I'm going to pull it out like that uh maybe yeah like a quarter or something like that that just gives me a little bit of relief on the front of the drawer there but there we go there's all the pieces you would need got a nice looking functional drawer all the if I needed to I could actually lay these pieces out and take them into the shop and cut it out and have a perfectly working drawer so I should have started with this but there are of course dozens of ways to build something like a drawer it's not a one anddone thing this is absolutely something people can BR with you could do pocket hole oh I said the p word pocket holes some people like those some don't uh doesn't have to be dovetails you could angle cut and glue and nail there's there's so many different ways to make those four pieces of wood come together this was just a way that I thought of when I saw can you model a drawer and that's what I did uh if you have a different way of doing it I love to hear about that too so leave that down in the comments and let me know uh if there's other ways you would have gone about creating a drawer model uh and maybe we'll pick them and uh show them right here on our Channel if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we like making these videos a lot remember you like them more when they're showing something you
