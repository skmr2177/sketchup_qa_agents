hey everyone Eric here and today the day that this video is launching to YouTube it's our independence day here in the United States so in honor of that we're going to model an American flag now I know an American flag or a flag in general might seem kind of simple but when you really think about being precise with your geometry and copying things like stars or Stripes that are repetitive there's actually a little bit of not only thought that has to go into it to get it right but also it's a really good use of just kind of reinforcing the basic tools so that's what we're going to do let's just go ahead and get right to it so the first thing I need to do is you can see I've got my flagpole here so the idea is once we have our flag we will we'll hoist it we'll put it up um I'm gonna switch right now into I'm gonna start drawing when I draft I like to kind of do it in plan view so I'm going to go let's go camera standard views top so now I'm in top view you can see there's my flagpole now what we need to do is start with sort of the basic shape of the flag now I know that uh at least the United States or the American flag is going to be approximately three by five in its proportions so I might go five foot comma three foot and you know kind of rule of thumb is to draw bigger than you need to you can always shrink or change the scale later so I'm actually going to do that now I'm actually going to scale this up by three and then if I want to bring that down I can but at least I know that my proportions are correct so where to start here the first thing I need to do is kind of uh decide where the stars in the stars and stripes go which is a sort of a box off to the side if I draw a midpoint if I hover with my line tool I can kind of split this in half and I know that this is uh I know that this box the blue box where the stars go is going to be 80 percent of halfway so I'm going to do a quick measurement that is if I check my measurements box seven and a half feet eighty percent of that believe it or not it works out to six feet so I'm just gonna start from this end and I'm going to use my move plus my modifier to make a copy of this line I'm going to go over six feet now I know where I can get rid of this that was just a reference so I knew kind of dimensionally you know how big I want to go so from here let's do some Stripes now for those that don't know the American flag actually has 13 of them so I'm going to just grab both of these two lines you can see it broke the bottom Edge broke when we drew that sort of 80 divider line and I'm going to switch again move plus modifier I'm going to grab this corner lift this up and I'm going to divide this by 13. so I'm just going to double check just to make sure my math is correct one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen so that's correct and I know that there are six um on from the bottom up is six stripes and I know from the top down is seven so I'm going to count one two three four five six and then I'm going to go ahead and erase these because this is sort of the blue box that our Stars will sit in and then don't need those because those stripes run all the way across you can see now we've got the basic shape maybe I'll zoom in a little bit if that helps you at home We have basically the basic shape that was pretty that was pretty um that was pretty good start let's move on to the Stars I'm going to slide this over and I'm going to start with my it's just my basically my polygon tool I think this is maybe the easiest way to do this I'm going to click anywhere I'm not really too concerned about the size I do however want I will scale it afterwards so I'll draw it kind of nice and big and I'm channeling my elementary school days I think when I first learned how to draw a star by just crossing these points essentially just by connecting tip to tip or corner to corner of a pentagon and I'm going to delete the outside lines using the Eraser tool and the inside lines again using the Eraser tool so now I have a star I know it's too big I'm going to make it a component because anytime you have more than one of something by default just out of habit I'll make it a component so I know this is too big I'm just gonna I just drew it big I'm gonna scale it down I still don't know if that's the right skill I'm going to go ahead and scale it again probably in just a minute but let's use that as a starting point so for those who don't know we have 50 stars and they represent 50 states here in the United States so what I need to do is I need to have 11 across and then I'm going to do um sort of alternating five and four down which would be sort of along the the y-axis so what I want to do is maybe shrink this down one more time just because I already know that's a little bit too large I'm not worried too much about the placement all I need to know is that I need to start in this corner and I want to grab this here and I'm going to pull this over to what is about the same distance I'm going to use the Divide tool so if you check my measurements box I'm going to say divide by 10 and the reason why is because if I select these I'm dividing by 10 because I already had one and that'll give me 11 components so that's perfect here again um if I knew exactly the dimension I was working with I can hit the uh you can hit the modifier I'm hitting the modifier which is option on a Mac I believe it's control on a PC and then what that'll do is it'll change that I'm centering I'm scaling from the middle and that's a good thing to do for the star in this case I want sort of the all of the the edges to the corners to line up okay so now that we've got that array copied we need to do another array but this time instead of horizontal vertical I'm going to use the move copy tool and I'm just going to kind of eyeball it for this step I'm going to move this star down to what looks to be about equal distance and I want to divide that by four and the reason why is because I need five copies so if I select those now five should be easy for me to count just in case five components that's perfect now the next thing you need to do is shift this one down I would like it centered between here and here I don't know where that Center Line is if I just kind of draw a line from here to here I'm just going to kind of say that that's the midpoint now I'm not sure if that's right but I'm going to call that right I'm using lines instead of guides because I'm just going to delete them after I feel like it's faster for me I know that we all have our personal preferences there I'm going to grab this one I'm going to use that same move modifier you can see I'm just using the same sort of basic tools over and over again this time divide that by three so I have my row of five and I have my row of four I don't need any of these only that last one because it tells me where to stop because we already did that distance that measurement it's going to tell me where to stop I'm going to grab both of these here don't need to group them but I guess if I wanted to I could so the next thing to do is we're going to copy all of these together this time I'm going to grab this now we only have 6 on the top row we did 11 but that's because we had 5 in the middle and 6. so this time I'm going to do it differently instead of doing 11. I'm going to copy this over I'm going to divide this by 5 which is going to give me six rows on the top and it's going to give me um again I've got five on sort of that's in between row here and this one was an extra one I'm going to go ahead and select each one of those and delete those and I know that this one's an extra one too because I left that one so if I did that right let's grab all of these and I'm going to say entity info 50 components for 50 stars that is fantastic so that was the first step in the process I'm going to group that you're going to see why in just a second now I like this flag but if I copied this and put it on my flagpole right now it would look a little stale because you know usually there's a breeze blowing and the flag has a little bit of movement and whatnot so in this case let's do that let's go the extra step of giving this a little bit of movement I went ahead and copied not copied I went ahead and used the rectangle tool to trace the outline so that I know that this is sort of the exact same proportions as the one above if it's easier for you to see I'm going to switch to perspective mode just for this step and what I want to do is I want to create something that has a wave to it so I'm going to use this as just kind of a temporary guide this little Extrusion box here and then and the reason why I'm doing that is I'm really just wanting to create some arcs so I'm using the arc tool I don't know depends on how far I want the wave it may be too much but what I could do is I could always come back here I could always come back and rescale it so if I wanted to do something like like that and then I wanted to come over here and and do something like this I'm not sure exactly what I'm what I'm doing other than the fact that I want about to be there and I kind of want that to be there and you'll see why in just a second let me see if I can get that again there we go because what I really don't what I really need is just this sort of wave form here and I'm going to leave that line You'll see why in just a second I'm going to leave a line there that's what I wanted I wanted a wave because I wanted to push pull this over and push pull this over and then there you go I don't need any of this extra stuff I really because the flag in this case I'm going to pretend I know it's got a thickness in real life but I'm going to pretend that it doesn't for this example let's see if we can make this one face instead of three I'm gonna open up my soften and smooth edges and just kind of push that a little bit and hope that that did sort of heal it or seal it so to speak so that's it from here we're going to drape the line work that we've created on our flat flag I'm going to bring that down onto our curved flag for this we're going to need sandbox tools and I'm going to select this and I'm going to say drape it using the drape tool here and drape it onto this curved mesh now I already know I've done this before so I already knew that this was not going to work for the stars and I don't know why exactly sometimes you know it's the sandbox tools or the drape tool it does things it has a mind of its own I think it's related to the fact that they're components so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all the component instances I'm going to copy them come out of my group I'm going to paste them in place and move them down along the blue axis and explode them now that's why I made a copy because maybe I wanted to keep my original component intact and then let's try this again drape and stars and there you go it worked don't need those that was just temporary don't need this I'm going to hide it in case I want it later just in case you know to be safe but that's it let's put a splash of color on this bad boy we're going to start with red and we're going to alternate down as we go and then we're going to switch over to White now it's already white the reason why it's showing like this is because my shadow settings are darker so actually I don't need to paint that white I could just leave it white if I wanted to and then we can do is come over here and maybe pick a blue so if I group that all together flip that on it's horizontal on its vertical flip it vertically 90 degrees and I'm going to grab a corner here let's see here and we're going to I'm going to grab a copy but yeah I don't have to I could have just moved it you know maybe offset that by two or maybe three inches just kind of looks like it's floating a little bit and I don't need that one I'm going to delete that and I don't know about you but I think our flag looks pretty good so I'm going to wrap up by switching my style over to one that I already have set up it's a watermark we're going to finish this off in some style literally and set the camera to two point perspective and now I am ready to celebrate my holiday so again I started this video saying that the flag really sounds kind of simple but when you looked at all those steps especially the fact that there's some math involved the fact that we want to be precise and accurate so we want to make things that make sure that we're using the copy by divide so that we know things are equally spaced this is just such a an important fundamental tool and you can see that once uh you know it and you kind of mastered it it you can apply that to so many different things so in this case we applied it to a flag and we're going to go ahead and give a salute and go watch the fireworks show so hope everyone has a great holiday if you're celebrating other than that have a great um day thanks for watching don't forget to like share comment subscribe give me a comment you know let me know what you thought we'll keep that conversation going there and I will see you next time thank you foreign foreign
