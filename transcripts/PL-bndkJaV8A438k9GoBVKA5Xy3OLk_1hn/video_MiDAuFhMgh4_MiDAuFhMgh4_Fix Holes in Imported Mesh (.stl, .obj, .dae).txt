hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at how to repair meshes as they're imported into SketchUp so some of this is pretty general information I mean it's it's repairing any mesh me a mesh by the way is a series of interconnected faces often times you know forming like some sort of smooth or undulating surface that kind of thing a lot of times this comes into play when you import meshes STL files obj files uh Dae files maybe anything that has geometry that gets imported in SketchUp a lot of times they can come in with holes in their surfaces and this is a couple of thoughts to think about when repairing those holes let's hop in all right so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to import uh a STL file so I'm going to go to file I'm say import and I'm going to grab uh this rhino head STL file that I have import that and there we go you see this is normal when you import a file um every triangle that makes up this file this an STL file so everything's triangulated but you can see every triangle is uh visible I can see every single one um this is normal so one of the things you can do is you can soften because uh it can be kind of hard to tell I know because I prepared this file that there is I believe like three holes in this mesh but it's pretty hard to pick them out right now one of the things I want to do is I do want to talk about this just using Straight SketchUp right we're not even going to talk about what you could do with extensions there are extensions out there like skimp or transmuter that'll help with importing files and there's of course solid inspector that will jump through something like this and see where the holes are that kind of thing uh for this let's just let's just talk about using native tools this is level up SketchUp not going Beyond desktop so so let's uh let's talk about this so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here I'm going to Triple click I entered the group when you import a file it does show up in a group so I'm triple click select all the geometry and then I'm going to shoot right over here soft and smooth edges I'm just going to toggle it off and back on and this doesn't actually fix anything so all this does is it Smooths the surfaces so it makes it easier to find things like look at that triang see that triangle right there that is a hole in the mesh if I tole hidden geometry real quick I can see the triangles that make it up healing this is pretty simple it's as simple as just going draw a line right there and then if I want to I can come in here and smooth those and they disappear just like the others so if I was to turn hometry back off there we go so that hole is gone with this you can start to look around and see some of the issues uh and then you know heal them back up in general what I would tell people people looking for holes in their mesh is look for places where the mesh gets dense so if I go back into hidden geometry um if I look at this see where this where in his mouth see bunch of smaller smaller spots right there that's where I can see okay I have some more holes that I could could clean up um but yeah finding those holes the easiest way to do it is to turn hidden geometry off and then spin around and look for spot there's some spots where based on the geometry I'll get i'll get lines like this right here this isn't a hole in the mesh this is just some lines that didn't get smooth based on uh the settings that I had when I turned soft and smooth on so that's not necessarily a problem in fact I might even be able to go in and just smooth those lines right out right here if I wanted to um not necessarily something I have to do it looks prettier but if this is being exported to like a 3D printer or something like that it wouldn't matter if these are smooth they're not just something I might do for my own beautification making it look nice um yeah so that's an option but yeah it's pretty easy to to get that cleaned up um I do have some other holes in here right down here I can see I have some a non-triangular hole my other holes were all triangular so drawing one line across the edge of a triangle closes it up if I turn I found this turn my hidden geometry back on if I have something like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa got a little crazy there little crazy all right there we go so if I have something like this it's non-triangular see this this hole is one two three four edges the way to close that up is going to be just draw a line right across like that because that creates two triangles so depending on the geometry there's a chance I might be able to draw a line on one side it close it up but if it's something like this that Line's probably needed there to create that that triangle to close that geometry up uh I have one more up here and again this point I'm just I'm just navigating to what I already know is here but you would go about this by looking around or again using solid inspectre um so this is a bunch of pieces and this is really this can be hard to clean up if I have my geometry hidden like this because it can be kind of hard depending on my view telling where the brakes are I definitely prefer hidden geometry like this because I can then I can just come in here and I can knit together my my pieces like that and then if I want to again smooth it I can come back in like this the reason I would go in and smooth it would be because if I was going through to check everything to make sure it was good I'll probably turn my hidden geometry back off and now I'm just looking for any place again that I have line showing up on my mesh so this of course begs the question well is there a better way to import geometry up here oh no those are all just again little lines I can smooth um is there a way to make geometry come in better answer yes there is all right so I'm just go ahead and start a new file real quick and I'm going to import as is the way to teach I'm going to show you how not to do it first so I can show you how to do it right later so I'm going to go to import and I have this rhino head small and I'm just going to go ahead and import it that's going to come in and you see it's this teeny tiny little little thing maybe it's a piece of jewelry or something like that but when I bring this in um I can see whoops I can see right here this got a bunch of tiny holes so this is running into you know tiny surface issue where SketchUp while it can maintain it can have models with very small pieces it can't always create small holes or small small faces so these little faces are probably I mean this is probably a fraction of a millimeter I have my my length set to inch and you can tell it's so you see it's approximately equal to zero inches if I come all the way over here we're only looking at a 16th of an inch so these are teeny teeny tiny surfaces and it's not importing into SketchUp when I do that so those surfaces are too small for SketchUp to draw on import but fortunately there is a simple simple solution to this if I go back to file import I import that same EX exact same file Rhino head small I'm going to come here to configure and I'm going to switch my units from millimeters to meters so that says in this file this this is maybe a couple millimeters long it's going to import and make it a couple meters long instead so when I hit okay and import it same exact geometry just a 100 times bigger and when I do that it zoom in on the exact same spot you can see all the spot where I had empty holes before look at that perfectly good smooth geometry no problems there so doing this importing as meters will give you this much bigger file or much bigger surfaces and then all I have to do is once once that's in I can grab this and I can scale it down to point was it 01 and then I can scoot that let's bring that right let bring that right over here and then that geometry then I didn't go quite small enough so scale down 0.1 that should be the same there we go now it's exactly the same size as the other one I imported millimeters but if I come in here look at it of course this one over here has holes in the ears this one doesn't just because I import as a larger unit so SketchUp could draw those surfaces then rescaling exact same geometry holes yes holes no so sometimes it's just that simple so I hope that helped you if you're doing a lot of 3D printing or working with other other file file types that kind of thing anything where you're importing geometry on a regular basis you probably are going to run into this sooner or later if you haven't already um like I said cleaning it up is really just a matter of finding those holes find the holes draw a couple lines to clean it up if you have big big holes big chunks missing uh that's where you may want to look into maybe it's an issue with the file you're importing uh if you have a bunch of small P pieces missing then you might try importing in a different unit to see if that helps close that up there is a a a garbage in garbage out is a term my dad used to use uh which means you bring in files with missing information sketchup's going to bring that missing information in so it is always a possibility that if you have a file that you're not familiar with you import it's missing faces that those faces may just be missing in the file and in that case you just probably to recreate them or maybe get a different file but uh those are some thoughts on those fixing those meshes I hope that helped uh if you like that video click like like down below and if you haven't already uh please do subscribe we create several videos a week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribed most importantly they leave us a comment down below if you run into issues like this do you have a secret that you like to use to repair meshes or is there another idea you think think would make a good video let us know in the comments below we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank [Music] you
