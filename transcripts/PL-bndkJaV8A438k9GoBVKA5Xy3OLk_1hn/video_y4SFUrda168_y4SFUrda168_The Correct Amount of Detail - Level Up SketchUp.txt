hey guys it's Aaron and today I wanted to get into level of detail and how you can make sure you're putting the proper amount of detail in your SketchUp models based on what you're going to use your model for all right so elephant in the room I do realize that the term level of detail is a Bim thing it means the amount of information um you may work at a firm where you have set levels of detail where level one is different from a level three lod1 lod3 that kind of thing I'm not talking about that stuff um this is strictly what I'm speaking about is strictly about the amount of detail you're putting into something you're modeling and making sure that it is the right amount of detail for how you're going to actually use that model so that's what I want to talk about level of detail just seemed to be the right way to to phrase that even though I knew that term could be considered by some people to have a different meaning but that's what we're talking about we're talking about having the the right amount of detail in my right amount of geometry in a model based on what you're gonna use it for we're gonna take a look at that right now okay uh right here I have three faucets that I downloaded from 3D Warehouse it would have been awesome to have the exact same faucet in three different levels of detail but uh these were what I was able to track down and find so um I'm gonna call these three different amounts of detail maybe amount of detail then that doesn't get confused with LOD amount of detail detail-ness detailingness detailed yeah we should stick with the amount of detail so over here on the left this is a simple 2D faucet right you can tell it's 2D because it's flat um so this right here this is something you may throw into your model if you don't need three-dimensional views I mean a lot of people end up exporting 2D floor plans through layout from SketchUp and that's it so they never go in and do any renderings or isometric views or anything like that if that's the case something like this slapped onto your sink is going to do just a fine job of showing that this is a faucet keeping in mind that when you actually see it it might be about that big right so see that little little set of lines right there that's representing a faucet and that's all you need at this point is that little teeny tiny bit of faucet showing up if that's the case 2D imagery like this even I mean this this could be dropped in in the layout you could put in your countertops put a sink on there and then leave things like this details like this like the the faucet or the sprayer or whatever other piece you have you might just leave that off and just drop it in this 2D layout that works fine too the advantage of using this is let's go ahead and double click in here let's grab everything here and I can see this is 80 entities that includes every Edge every face um you see around here each of these edges of this this half circle or this Arc right here 80 entities super lightweight I mean that's that's nothing I mean that's not gonna that's not gonna affect my model in any way shape or form right so a lightweight model like this is going to lead to a more performant model I'm not going to have issues where maybe I'm building uh you know a condo block and they have 30 units and then each kitchen has this in here oh no problems no problems whatsoever right downside of course is as I rotate around this look at in 3D that's not impressive right if I want to do a rendering or something like that I'm out of luck with this guy this is not going to lend itself to anything other than an overhead view so I'm not saying you should use this but this is the lowest level of detail you can create in SketchUp this is just a 2d representation of 3D models so it's an option it's the lowest level a step up from that is what we have right here so this is a higher level of detail it's a 3D model it's not beautiful I mean it's not it's not like I'm not going to go in and do a render of this by itself you can actually see as I'm moving around you can see the Shadows jumping off the surfaces if I go up to view and I hit show hidden geometry you can see you can see right here this is not uh you know this is not made for close-up rendering anything like that but what this does do is this does tell me there's a faucet here this looks great from above I can render this from the side I could I could move around the kitchen I'm going to see this and honestly if I come in here and select all this I've got a couple containers here there we go there's all my geometry 338 so about four times what I had over here but like I said you can tell there's a fossil you can tell what kind of faucet this is uh if you have an eye for faucets maybe you even have an idea of whose faucet this is there's not a maker's mark on here but uh this is the level of detail that I would say would work for uh you know 3D views um the nice thing about this is if I had this in say I was doing an a section cut through my kitchen seeing that from the side is going to tell me a faucet it's a faucet just the same as if I saw it overhead so this is the nice medium this is the middle ground I would say this is the amount of detail that's you know the thing about faucets that I say it's about toilets too is if they show up in imagery you know I'm going to be zoomed back they're going to be about this big right like if I want to see that a decent amount of the kitchen I'm not going to be in here like this this faucet should probably in a normal architectural or design drawing would not fill up much of the screen so even if I was like looking at a cabinet view you know where I'm looking here's all my cabinets and here's the faucet that's probably about as big as it's going to get on the page so I don't need 10 000 polygons in this faucet to make it do its job as a faucet and this is really what I'm talking about when I'm talking about a detail is how much detail how many polygons you want to put into this model so that it does its job so for General architectural construction drawings this level of detail works just fine now I do have a model it's a step up from there if I look at this in Hidden geometry you can see I got lots of geometry right look at look at this little little button in here to cover up the screw hole um yeah you can see this little little Mark right here to make uh the little faucet head that I can screw up or unscrew with the wrench it's got the little flat box in there and the little flat marks around it over look at that see all that geometry tons of geometry right a lot a lot of geometry here this is let's find out how much there is this is a couple uh levels deep but I think if I get down here far enough there we go okay so this has whoa wait hold on I'm gonna move a 33 000 entities so this is like 10 times the geometry that was in our our previous this was 300 this is 33 000. so that's not 10 times that's that's uh sorry try to do math spontaneously right there um so you can see it is a whole lot more geometry but and I I did take the textures off of all these I printed or I I I use paint bucket to make everything just the plain white because I wanted to look at them side by side but you can see as I move around here over here where we had these softened angles kind of jumping as I move around see that that harsh geometry there's a weird line right there this I don't get that nice smooth Shadows because I have so many polygons this right here would be overkill for this view right looking down from above again this big take your pick here right any of these would work just fine to show that there's a faucet on a eighth inch equals a foot floor plan looking at an elevation view yep that shows that there's a faucet I could probably even make out who's whose uh faucet this is based on the profile where the lines are that kind of thing I could figure that out this is a good detailed view in in an isometric view it's going to look great rendered out there looks awesome the downside is again if I'm I'm doing that condo that has I don't know 30 of these throughout the whole building that's a whole lot of geometry we're talking about millions of polygons just for faucets so it's a little too much now depending what I'm doing if I'm doing a beautiful render of a kitchen and I want this High poly thing because I'm going to put some Chrome on here and it's going to shine and the sun's going to come in through the window and reflect off of it okay you know I get it I get having the smooth thing there if if you're a product manufacturer and this is your product then you might have a render that consists of this and absolutely you should have thousands of polygons in here that is that is exactly what this would be for for a regular construction drawing probably Overkill probably more geometry than I need but if you're doing that high level render or that product product imagery then it makes a lot of sense so just to back up 2D lightest thing you can have most performant thing you're going to have only going to look good in one view top down view or I mean you could have this in a profile view too so but that's the only way it's going to look good over here on the other end super high res super polygon dense not going to be ideal if there's a bunch of these in the model not where you want to spend that you know that that that file weight is not on a faucet I said same thing for toilets I I toilets do this too also where it's super easy to get those curves and everything blown up so you have a million faces just in a toilet this is too much this is gonna eventually if there's multiples in your models it can cause your model to lag this guy in the middle couple hundred this is pretty performant it does the job you know from here if I zoom back to like right here they're obviously different kinds of faucets but I can't tell that I'm missing a whole lot from this versus this so be considered especially using 3D Warehouse look at your model download into a separate file open it up check it out see if it's the right amount of detail for the job that you are currently trying to do the Crux of this thing right is that when you look at your model and you you see the geometry in there are you putting the geometry where you need it if you're drawing a floor plan you know your geometry should be going into stuff like the house the floor the what are the things you need to see in order to build that house from that floor plan you're doing a render then you're going to put stuff into like those curves those those fancy uh Entourage pieces put the right amount of geometry in to what you need if you're just doing a mock-up I'm going to quick see how this you know how I might finish my basement something like that you don't need a 33 000 face faucet to do a mock-up for a bathroom remodel just not necessary it's going to slow your model down we get models all the time on Forum forums.sketchup.com if you're not right there you should check it out but people go oh my model is too big it won't open it's so slow it's so long and you open it up and they have you know toilets with two million faces a car in the garage with you know the cup holders detailed inside of it awesome models but not the right amount of detail for what they're trying to use it for so that's the biggest thing put the right amount of detail in for what you're gonna use it for and you'll be pretty happy let me know if you've ever run into this before love to hear about it down in the comments or if this is new to you and something you're trying love to hear that too if you have another idea of what you think would make a good video on our Channel let us know that as well have a great day bye [Music]
