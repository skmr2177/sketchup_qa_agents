hey guys I'm Aaron and today we are going to Model A fos I'm going to see how quickly you can do this not not rush through it but just see how quick we can go through the steps the big part of something like this is breaking the thing down into modelable chunks so I want to do a quick breakdown of this this particular image tell you how I would go about modeling it and then try to put it together fairly quickly let's hop in all right so what I tend to do when I start looking at something like this is I break it down into modelable chunks so when I look at this I wouldn't go in and try to model this all as one piece I would try to break it down into smaller pieces so in this case uh this base right here would be one piece uh this section coming up will be a second intersected by a thir on the end of that we have a fourth piece the neck that goes up and curves over would be a fifth piece and then the head would be the sixth piece so let's let's just model that I'm I'm going to do this fairly this is not a tocale image anything like that so I'm just going to model beside this um I'm not going to take strict measurements off or anything like that but um let's get that base in there real quick so the base looks like it's a rectangle about that big and then it's rounded over at the end so I'm just going to put a circle and a Circle and then just come through with an eraser I'm going to pull that up a little bit actually undo I'm going to select those edges and I'm going to weld them then I'm going to pull it up slightly offset bring it in a little bit and then I will push that up again and I'm going to call that my base and put it in its own group and then what we're going to do is we're going to create this next piece on top of it I want that piece to set right in the middle here so I'm going to grab a circle and go to the Middle Point start pulling down uh I can line that up with the other Edge over here so bring that across so it hits that middle and then there we go and that circle's going to go all the way out like that um for the profile what I generally do is something like this I draw a rectangle coming up aligning with the middle of that that Circle and then I will draw my rect my my shap tape on top of this so it looks like I got two bump bump then it goes up straight bump and then I have a taper so I'm going to do something like this I'm going to come in here a little bit and this is going to be the body of that and we'll come right here we'll do a quick circle like this and then all I need is this piece so I'll just take that piece drag it straight down modifier key to put that up once right there and then we're going to take that again and we're we're going to bring that up to about there at which point this will kind of angle up like that gives me that shape like that um and I'm I'm going kind of quick but I can come through here and I can round this corner off a little bit that's probably more how that's going to look um looks good all right I'm going to take my circle I'm going to use follow me and there we go triple click that make it a new group uh oops here I don't need that I don't need the circle underneath there anymore all right so there's that base piece this piece coming out what I want to do is I want to make that actually here let's let's let me undo that let me go grab that Circle right there copy it now I can delete it I'll come out here and paste that I actually was saying I want a circle just slightly smaller than this so I'm going to take this and I'm going to inset it just just offset just push it off just a little bit like that and then I will take that we'll rotate that 90Â° and we'll grab it by the middle we'll take the middle of that and we'll line it up with the middle of this there we go and then uh we'll just drop it down a bit I'm realizing right now as I'm doing this it I I made this a little bit shorter than I wanted that's okay CU it's easy to come in here grab this and we'll just stretch that up a little bit that gives a little more space for this which makes a little more sense all right I'm going do the same same exact thing I did before I will take this out draw it straight up again I'm just getting a rectangle a surface just to draw my profile on and I'm just want to draw something along these lines so what this looks like what we got happening is this comes out like this to I don't know about there and then maybe we go uh it's kind of hard shiny stuff especially can be kind of difficult to see exactly how this works but looks like kind of got these uh stepping doy shapes technical term right there apologize if that's over your head uh but we're going to do something like this we're going to start uh this one's going to come out a little a little bit further it's going to come like this come down this one's going to come out to about here step down and then this one's going to be about here it went off axis that's why that that line got weird well that's there's your problem all right I was not paying attention to my uh my number or my colors as I was going across and I wandered off axis there all right at the end the very end I do want to have this a little stem sticking out the handle will will tie into that so that's about what we want there and then I just have to put some curves on here so I'm just going to I'm going to use an arc and I'm going to just kind of do something like this actually that one will go kind of further down almost almost to here and then what I didn't do is I didn't take this one back so we'll do that here that does that one step up too a little bit so actually what happens is this kind of returns a little bit and then goes like this something like that all along those lines cool and I'll take this again and then we will follow me with this we got kind of our there's our our shape and I can fine-tune a little bit here too because I can grab like this geometry and I can say all right let's let's stretch that let's scale that out a little bit I like to do this cuz I I like it's kind of like sculpting you know so if I want to grab maybe just this part and scale that and maybe drag that out a little bit more I can play with those those shapes and then what I want to do down here I'm going to close that and then just drag that in like that perfect I'm going to Triple click make that into a new group um and then I'm going to real quick uh we're going to throw together this piece right here I could probably do this actually on here watch this I could just I'm going drag line straight down and then I'm going to kind of draw my profile here like that and then I'm going to draw a full circle right here uh when I'm drawing stuff like this I will draw it a little bit ways because then I can always drag it and drag it back down where I want it like that all right that's going to then go up out up little bit in up back out up back in and then I'm going the same thing I'm going to come up here this handle goes out like this this handle goes out like this and then I can use arcs to kind of just close a lot of that up so come back to here and then can also use arcs my round my roundness out there all right so something along those lines then that whole thing then would just be traced around a circle the circle I just drag right down here grab that just say follow me click there and then I'll triple click make that a group and then and I will grab it right by that piece that will go right into the middle of this circle right here turns transparent so it's real easy to line that up where it goes and then slide it back in all right last two pieces this one's pretty simple um I'm going to turn on uh my I'm going to turn go to view show my hidden geometry temporarily that's going to make it easier to find the center right here if I draw a line from here to here the middle of that edge is then the center so I can just say I'm going to draw an edge like that going to go straight up straight out and then straight down and then I will create an arc here here there we go get rid of that get rid of that and then uh I'm GNA triple click actually I'll do a group select because I don't want that I don't want this Edge down here but I'll grab those right click and say weld edges get rid of these edges down here come here and draw a circle exactly that biggish going grab that one more not one more another follow me it's going to bring that tube up and around um see our our whole thing is a little chunky a little little wide but uh that's okay I can turn off my hidden edges too I don't need those uh hidden geometry anymore uh and then the last piece I'm going to have here is going to be uh this piece here and I'm going to do the same thing this doesn't quite hit perfectly flat so I'm going to I'm going to have to exaggerate a little bit but I'm going to have a piece that comes out like this that comes in a little bit and then up here abouts we'll have a piece that comes like this and then that and that's that's all that's all there is to it um I'm not going to get all the detail I want into uh the the head I'm not going to I'm not going to uh um just because of the time we're working with here but I'll I'll go ahead and just do something like this will have a you know the geometry of the head will be there but I'm not going to put the little holes and such in there just cuz I'm making a quick quick version here so I'm going to drop a circle I'm going to hit my up Arrow to make it flat pull it out again same thing select uh a follow me hit that here grab that triple click make that into a new group and grab it right by the center so I come across here this is not a circle because it's a follow me it's an extruded shape but I can always reference the two edges like that and that'll get me the very middle right we turn upside down then same thing's going to happen here I don't have that middle ledge I'm go to one corner another Corner pull that across go and drop it there we go oops too much deleting get rid of that edge we don't need that edge all right but there we go and then I can get rid of these circles over here I can triple click I can grab all of these pieces make that into oops what piece didn't I oh this was not a separate group make that into its own group now I could grab all of these make that into a new group itself and there we go there is there is our our quick faucet uh based on on just an image all right so we weren't this is this is by no means like uh working off of Machining drawings where I'm within a millimeter accuracy I don't I don't know my accuracy was at all but what I got was a faucet in what about a little over 10 minutes uh right off of a photo and that could very well go into my model and represent uh that faucet uh that the customer wants specifically and I can't find on 3D Warehouse something like that so not intended to be fabrication ready I wouldn't want to use this to create drawings and send to a machine shop anything like that but uh it's enough in a quick amount of time to get that geometry where it's going to I mean no arguing that's a faucet right I mean that's that's what that thing is uh and it looks like the one in there if I put a little gold on there uh hopefully that uh that helps and uh you learn some new tricks there if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please do leave us a comment down below are there models like this that you can think of that you're not quite sure how to break down and how to model uh let us know that in the comments or if you have another idea that you think would make a good video something we don't do regularly let us know that too we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
