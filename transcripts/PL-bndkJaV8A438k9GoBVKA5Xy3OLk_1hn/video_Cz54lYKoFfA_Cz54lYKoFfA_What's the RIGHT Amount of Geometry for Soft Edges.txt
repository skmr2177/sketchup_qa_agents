hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to take a look at making things look soft so softness is a tactile thing right it's it's something you have to touch you have to touch something to re to realize its softness you can't taste hear or smell softness you have to touch it um when we talk about things like in a 3D model we can make things look like they're soft and we do this by things like adding textures or or colors to that that maybe reflect less light indicates that they're not hard or when we're talking about geometry 3D geometry it's things like rounding off Corners so let's take a look at how to quickly and easily make something look softer than it actually is all right so I got a couple of Cubes right here they're not actually cubes they're boxes they're not the same size on all sides so what we're going to do is we're going to look at how to make these Corners look a little bit softer we have a couple options here um I'm also going to mention maybe some extensions that can help you with this too but uh there's one principle in particular which is using the soften and smooth edges dialogue that's going to help with smoothing geometry so there's one easy way to make this look soft I have these nice crisp 90° Corners here um and we're going to take a look at how do we go about actually making these three edges look less prominent let make it softer uh I'm going to do this real quick using an arc so I'm going to come in here I'm going to throw an arc right here this is going to be an exaggerated example so we're going to make this nice and big so here's an arc I'll push pull that down there we go knock off that corner go back into my arc put another Arc right here on this Edge that grab this Edge this Edge and this Edge going to go to tools go to follow me and click on that there we go so now we got these nice soft edges I could come in here and I could get rid of these extra lines around here to make this look even softer and got there we go so there we go so now obviously very nice very soft this is this is big obviously I went with this nice big round Corner um but we can do this without adding all of that the other thing we did do there is if I turn on show hidden geometry I can see I added a lot to this so what was originally what's this 18 entities is now 582 entities so you can see this this looks great but it added some geometry to our model it's also exaggerated like I said this is way out there if I'm just trying to knock off a corner I'd probably want to use arcs that are maybe you know just a fraction of the size just a little teeny cut off the corner cut off the corner but you can see it does a lot there so one of the things you can do I could do this right now is I can just grab these three edges right here and I can sell it to make that soft and smooth and when I do that we got to turn off my hidden hidden geometry though uh you can see it gets rid of those lines so it can kind of start to suggest uh softness this is a little bit crazy right this is this is actually looks like it just hid lines it didn't necessarily soften stuff so much um but there's other things I can do to make that kind kind of give that same softness without going through the process of adding a whole bunch of geometry or including you know a bunch of extra steps so one of the things I like to do is I will grab two edges like this or this could work on all four sides but we're going to try to emulate the same thing here and I'm going to offset these yeah that much yeah like a half inch do exactly half inch I don't know what size this box is but I'm using a half inch all right so I'm going to do that on all of these sides I'm I'm picking a half inch because I want it to be the same on all three sides you take that one two offset that5 okay so now we've we've offset all of them now I can take this face and I can actually use move to just pull that out I don't want to go out a full half well I guess if I do a half inch there I'll get let's go let's go 0.25 so pull that out I'm going perpendicular to the face 025 enter and we'll do the same thing here pull it this way 0.25 enter and I grab this one pull it up 25 enter and then what I can do is I can grab that geometry right there and again actually we can just grab it all grab every bit of that thing and say soften it so there we go we got a more realistic soft Edge and right now if I grab all that 27 enties versus 231 let's turn our hidden geometry on we get a true Count 582 entities versus 39 entities so big difference in the amount in the quantity there I'm going to argue that you know for a lot of examples this is probably fine for an architectural model for retail model this is probably more than enough to sell that this is a soft Corner in some cases like I said depend on how I'm using this right if I'm if I'm Zoom way back like this well yeah they no big difference no big deal right um obviously if if this thing is it's a jewelry box or something like that and it is the main stage and they going to render and that kind of thing sure yeah go high detail like this but if we're looking for efficient modeling and ways to just soften the corners to make it look less pointy this is more than enough and again in some cases maybe just softening or hiding hiding a single Corner hiding an edge is enough so over here have a couple examples uh same thing very similar here I have a couch cushion so if I look at this couch cushion all by itself see there yeah looks really nice if I look at all the geometry in there is Big it's heavy over here again I'm going say comparable you know from from where we're looking at it not a big difference this piece right here and see I just knocked off one corner I didn't even do two like I did in the other one so a fraction of the geometry so you can actually see it here right you can see all the extra edges all the extra lines versus here just getting a slight knockdown and then soften and smooth what's the difference I mean like when when we actually get into it so two things there's two things one is that when you do soften with a whole lot of edges like this you do get more control over the shadow so look at see as I as I move my camera around you can see this Shadow how it follows that curve it does look better so if I'm up close if I'm you know I don't know why but if I was doing a render of the arm of the couch that makes sense put it like that over here I have less control it turns all white and I get some cases some weird overly dark Corners that kind of stuff I have less control over it's less smooth because I have less surfaces that SketchUp is running that light across when I have something like this SketchUp knows okay light break light break light break at every one of those edges every one of those hidden brakes it's going to smooth the light into the next face over here where we have just these two it goes okay light from here smears into here light from here smears into here and that's it so we get a lot less uh smooth light like right here so it just kind of jumps jumps because it's smoothing across three surfaces here rather than all of these surfaces here so you do have a little bit more uh control over those Shadows if you break it up like this you're more likely to get uh you know hard Shadows on soft geometry if you don't do something like that but you can see again depending what you're doing is it worth coming in and adding all this super heavy geometry for a couch it's going to sit in the back and I'm going to see it like this in a render probably not if I'm in here and uh you know I'm looking at a living room and this is the center piece of the living room okay yeah maybe in that case but uh it's up to you it's really I mean I'm here to show you options I'm showing you options uh yeah High poly low poly either way can be smoothed the quality of the smoothness is going to depend depend on how much geometry you want to put in there and how much work you want to put into it one of the other things to mention of course is this doesn't have to all be done manually I don't have to do this couch the same way I did this block here with multiple steps I can use extensions like Fredo corner or mindsight Studios bevel something like that to get a bunch of these smooth Corners at the same time but the fact is at the end depending on the amount of geometry you put in there you're going to end up with a heavier model but again more control over how that light falls across those smooth Corners so like I said options but uh something to note that all it takes to go from being a hard 90° angle to being what could be a soft geometry is something as simple as softening an edge again if you're taking something like that same sofa we had and it's going to be this big in the corner of your model you might just not even knock the corners off you might just selectively soften a few edges just to make the front look like it's soft uh it's up to you but you don't have to go to the point of modeling every single crease in Geometry that's in a in a piece of furniture something like that you can get away with just hiding and softening specific faces I hope that helps if so go ahead and click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please do leave us a comment down below uh how do you go about this sort of thing are do you have to do this do you ever soften anything do you have another tip you think would make a good video or do you run into a problem that you'd like us to help you answer if so let us know in the comments you like making these videos a lot but we like them even more we in the showing I was almost out it was my last line we like making these videos a lot we like even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
