hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around let's talk about cutting components cutting components are sometimes known as window components they're components that will cut through another surface Windows happens to be a common use case but you can use them for a number of different things they're a little bit you know you have to make them in a very exact way so sometimes they're not as widely known they also can be a little finicky so let's talk about how to make them and cases where you might or might not use them the basic idea of a cutting component is this we're going to draw on another surface and I don't have anything grouped in here or simplicity's sake but if I push a simple opening into this wall and select that opening make component you see it says cut opening here and if I copy and paste that you can even paste it to other surfaces but it's cutting that opening through any of these and in fact if we add some more detail in here save and delete that into your surface so we could see right through that you can see what it's what it's doing so let's talk about how to make these now we can use um a little more complex example let's say something like this we can add some detail before we make it or after but here's the key if I double click on this wall surface these edges are part of what shows up as the bounding edges and these edges are shared between the Surface and the component we're trying to create so when we select this component we just have to be sure we're selecting all the geometry including and essentially these outside shared edges now if we had a more complex model you want to be extra careful because if I select like this go to make component cut opening is not an option and you can guess why of course it's because I drew this geometry back here and accidentally selected it so just make sure so make sure your selection is clean I'm going to right click make component cut opening should be checked glue to any should be there and that is your clue that this will work we can turn that off if we wanted but we do want this to cut an opening glue to any you notice that the axis doesn't have the typical red green and blue axis where it's blue is facing out in a different line this only has the red and green directions because it is aligned to a surface so when we create this we can do things like array it as we saw we could copy and paste it you could bring it in from the component browser it would work and we're not limited to the original one once we've created this idea of this shape cutting into a surface we can change that original shape we can continue to make some changes here we can even extend this out Beyond the original surface as long as we're maintaining that there is a set of outlined shapes that will cut an opening we just have to make sure we maintain that if we were to lose that obviously we'd lose that cutting ability so I'm going to undo that if I triple click and just move this off to the side as though I was moving it somewhere you can see the sort of ghost of what was left as is cut through that surface so that's the idea just make sure you have a good selection and make that into a component now the thing about cutting components is they will only cut through one surface like we've got here foreign take this surface I could delete it I'm going to add just a material that has an opacity so we can see through it and then copy and paste it over here this wall has a thickness and even though it will cut through this front surface it will not cut through the back surface if I were to edit any of these extend that window back further over here it just pushes right through that wall but it doesn't cut through it now there are some cases out there and some people have developed workflows where they'll create a cutting component on one side a gun and component on the other the thing you have to be aware of though is that I can't take this cutting component and embed it or Nest it inside another component and have it's still for example I couldn't take this one and this one make those a component this is going to mess up that behavior it didn't even create the component so just be aware that you can only ever cut through one surface and there's some extensions and like I say some workflows to kind of get around that but you just do be aware of that another thing to be aware of when I say they're a little finicky this is a case of how that can be so if I copy and paste this example here I could take perhaps both of these and array them and that'll work fine but it can get a little trickier if you're trying to push that functionality too far if I have two surfaces and then I'm copying multiple components maybe one will work but if I say 2 times oh it didn't like that trying to array multiple cutting components across multiple surfaces so just again be aware that you may need to a little bit sensitive with how you use cutting components on in your particular use case so that's why some people like them and some people don't another reason is that if you happen to accidentally lose your original surface well that's easy we can draw that original surface back but now that's a new Surface it doesn't register that these were cutting supposed to be cutting through it so I'm going to undo undo but you have to be aware that that could happen as well one last um thing to know we've just been talking about how cutting components only cut through one surface so in theory we couldn't use them on a curved Edge except in SketchUp when we show hidden geometry we know that curved edges are in fact made up of flat segments so as long as we view hidden geometry and I've got that on a keyboard shortcut then I could come in while I'm viewing hidden geometry create a cutting component and as long as I maintain using it on flat surfaces then this could work for us and we just talked about copying multiple components this I think should work for us that we should be able to array this let's say three times and that that did work for us those worth trying and again there are components so we could continue to edit them as long as we maintain that outer cutting edges you know that can be something very interesting depending on what you're trying to model so massing model there are use cases where these can be really helpful and there's cases where you either have to treat them with you know a very specific techniques or find a different method so this all depends on on your preferences and what you're trying to model okay there you go hopefully that made sense if you haven't tried cutting components even if you don't think you'll use them it's worth going in giving them a try understanding how SketchUp can under you know create that relationship between shared surfaces and sticky geometry they are pretty interesting I find them useful definitely in some use cases but again it sort of just varies your mileage will vary depending on your type of projects there we go hopefully that was interesting let us know what you think let I'd be curious do any of you use cutting components how do you use them what do you find them really useful for or where in fact might they break for you let us know and let us know what else you would like to see us talk about in these videos please do like and do that subscribe thing and we'll see you next time [Music]
