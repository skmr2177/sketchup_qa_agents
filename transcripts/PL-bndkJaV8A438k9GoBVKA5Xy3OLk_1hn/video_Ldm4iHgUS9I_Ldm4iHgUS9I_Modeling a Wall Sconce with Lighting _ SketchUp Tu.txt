hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to model a wall [Music] scon so for those of you who aren't as uh highend as me scon is a fancy word for a wallmounted light um so it's kind of a cool architectural detail it's functional because like I said it is a light it brings light in um and the fact is sconces can look like anything I mean there's there's things that are different shapes round Square they look like things you would hang on a wall um there there there's lots of different ways they could look uh we're going to keep it kind of simple but I want to put some cool details in there that's going to set what we model apart from maybe something else you might see let's hop in and check it out all right so we're going to put a wallcon up here first thing we need is a wall so I'm just going to use my rectangle tool draw a quick rectangle on the ground like this pull it up and there we go we have a wall I'm going to Triple click that and make it a group now we're going to create a scon to put on here I'm going to model this flat on the ground actually and make it a component that will snap up to the wall um so I'm going to this is I'm going to start with a fairly basic shape so I'm going to the base of this that sits on the wall is going to be a square rectangle like this I'm going to pull that up like that and that's going to be the base plate basically that sits on the wall I'm going Tri triple click that and uh we're just going to throw a dark color on there so you guys know I don't like black I'll use this charcoal or tungsten sorry uh and I'm going to Triple click that and make it a group I like black I'm just saying I don't use black as fill colors because I like to be able to see the edges against my colors for my material so I'll grab that make it a group um and now my scon I want to have it like an extruded half circle it's going to sit up on the wall so I'm going to do this I'm look at this side like this I'm going to draw a circle right here pull across like about that big that looks good I'm going to cut that across get rid of this and then I'm going to pull this out this way a little bit and I'll pull it up this way so that's pretty much what my scon is going to look like on the on there um I want to go a little bit further with this so I'm going to start I'm going to grab uh this color and I'm going to put that on ends like that so this will be the part that lights up um no you know what I'm going to go a little bit further that I'm going I'm going to grab this Edge right here I'm going to option copy it in like that and I'm going grab this I'm going to option copy that in uh about the same was about 716 before there we go and then just fill that in that as well that looks cool I like that um let's go further let's keep going um I want to I'm gonna draw a rectangle over here I want to put a unique pattern on here maybe something that looks like it's cloth or weaved or something else other than just plain white plain white works but let's go let's do something else we're here to learn stuff so let's learn some stuff I'm going to go to something I wouldn't normally think of like brick let's go to Brick and I'm going to grab this brick texture and I'm going to fill it in here um yeah I like that that's going to work for what I want to do uh I'm going to right click go to texture and hit position I'm going do a couple things I'm going to turn it so it's vertical like this and then I'm going to make it considerably smaller like that so that's the texture I want to put on here not almost the texture um but you can see when you when you do that it looks like some kind of fabric if I'm zoomed out uh if you didn't know it was brick you'd probably not catch that it was brick but we're going to go a little bit further because I'm going to take that I'm going to go back to uh my in model materials and here's here it is I'm going to double click on it when I double click on it it shows up down here I now have the ability to edit this and I'm going to edit it by jumping back over here to this tool any of the color editing tools would work if I want to use sliders instead but what I want to do is I want to make this make it lighter so it looks like you know it's like a light is what it's supposed to be and then let's make it paler as well um might be a little I think that'll work that looks good all right and let's uh let's come in here whoops and let's sample that and apply it here and there we go that's a cool looking uh little sconce I like how that looks um very unique uh I'm going to Triple click that make it its own group so now I have two groups this group here this group here and I'm going to take both of those and I'm going to say make component I'm going to call that ascon because that's what the name of the thing is and then I'm going to also say uh let's set snapping to I'll just say any that way if I have a spot I want to put it that's not vertical I can and then let's hit create when we do that let's go ahead and close our Windows here um this scon now should show up in our components and what I should be able to do is just drag this and then click on it I'm sorry not drag click on it and then when I drop it on the wall it snaps right to it so it come down this Edge wall here snap it on there um and because we made it snap uh to any surface I could put it flat on surfac like that that's just glue to that's that's pretty simple pretty easy and uh get rid of those extra ones I don't need that I just want this that looks cool but how do we take that maybe a little what how do we go another level higher the materials kind of a nice effect um what what could we do to make this a little bit more how do we do more I'm so glad I asked so one thing I know if because this is a component I can edit this one down here and then whatever change I make here is going to show up to any of these that are in the model which in this case is this one right here uh if we wanted to we do this too we could take this one and we could bring that over here straight across and then if we make a change to this it's going to actually happen to both that's just basic components any change I make to this one is going to show up in both so this is kind of cool because I can make changes as I go even after they're installed in the model um let's go a little further and let's I want to actually add some light to this now SketchUp is not a renderer SketchUp does not go through and figure out where light sources are and how light bounces off there's no Ray tracing or anything like that but I do have some things I can do to emulate lights in my model so one of the things I can do is I can actually import an image of uh some fading colors and use that as light so I'm going to come in here let me show you what I'm talking about I'm going to import I have an image on my desktop and this right here wall light is the what I'm talking about so I'm going to say import that and I'm just going to drop that boom right behind that light scale it to the right size I'm slide it over a little bit slide down a little bit cool and then what I can do is I can take that so you see that P that picture that image is a picture of translucent uh yellowy material that Fades off into nothing so you can see look at look at my blue lines right back here my blue axis you can see it behind as I get closer to the center it disappears all the way behind that light all this was was a radial gradient that I put onto uh I I can't remember a 300X 300 pixel Square simple super super simple uh not a whole lot of work I know people are going to ask for this file in uh the the comments I I don't have a way to share it through YouTube so no can't give it to you but it is super easy to make you could you I have faith you could do this yourself um all right so let's let's see what that looks like when we put it in the model so right now it's separate here's my component here is the imported image so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go to edit and say cut then I'm going to open the component by double clicking and I'm going to say edit paste and place soon as I do that it shows up on both of them but wait why didn't it show up on here so what's happening right now is the back of this surface which is where that image at where that image at where that image is at is right in line with the wall so it's causing a little bit of an issue so if I grab this I slide it up I can see it's right there but I have two surfaces on top of each other so if I take this wall and I slide it actually won't let me slide because I'm glued too here's what I'll do I'll come in here and I'll take this material and I will move it up like like this I'm going to move it up I'm going to exaggerate a little bit I'm going to move up a little bit higher and then by doing that you can see that gets rid of the fighting between that plane and the wall wall a little bit taller to take full advantage of that material I put on there there we go all right so that's kind of cool it's like I said it's a real simple lighting effect this is now a part of the component so anytime I grab this and bring it in it just going to show it's just going to show up like that but uh I like that I want to go just I you guys know I like to just push it I like to go a little bit further let's go just a touch further here's what I want to do I want to actually because the way this is built light wouldn't hit down below here or up above here we kind of have V's of no light coming out um so I want to emulate that so what I'm going to do is I'm going to temporarily take my image I'm going to drop it back down to flush with the back that's just going to make it easier to make that edits I'm about to make and what I'm going to do is I am going to take a spot like right about there and I'm going to draw a line out to like there this is not very specific uh but then I'm going to take that edge and I'm going to say okay now copy that hold on my modifier key to make a copy and just find the middle there and I'm going to take both of these edges and I'm going to say the same thing copy it again hit the modifier key to copy and grab the red and pull the the red to the middle here all right so now I have those four edges um this currently is not a texture or material this is currently an image to get it so it's an editable texture I have to right click and explode it as soon as I do that it drops into context with the rest of this um now what I want to do is I want to cut out these two pieces to do that though I do have to close up this face so I'm going to come here to the end of this one take it over to this one see as soon as I did that see how it broke same thing on this side click right here drag it across to here that side breaks all right now little bit of quick cleanup erase erase erase and there we go erase erase erase oh it's looking good look at how that breaks but I have these edges on here so I'm just going to in my Eraser I'm going to hit shift shift is hide and I'm going to go around and just hide the edges like that like that and then when we exit out now look at the shadow that I just created there oh look at that so we'll make this a little bit bring this home just a touch I'm going to go into the wall group and I'm going to color that with a just a little bit darker color and then uh yeah there you go so kind of a cool like I said sconces themselves can look like anything so the idea of drawing a scon which was my original idea for this that could be just about anything so simple model but by adding that image and then doing a little bit of editing to the image cutting it up a little bit uh I could see how that that worked out and I you'll notice this too uh when we made that a little bit darker my material didn't uh end up behind so I don't have Z fighting issue that I had before uh either so that turned out kind of cool so yeah check that out quick and easy wall sconces with a lighting effect so this kind of took on a life of its own as I started putting this together I was looking at wall sconces and going wow there's so many options out there of geometry that I could put together uh this idea came through and I thought this is this is fun this is kind of a a cool way to take that add that little extra something to your SketchUp model both between the materials that are actually on the lens part of the scon but then also just creating that that faux lighting situation like I said sketchup's not a rendering engine so it's not going to go through and put a light source in it anything like that that's just not it's sketchup's intended for model creation but that doesn't mean you can't take geometry and add a little bit of extra value a little bit of extra you know pop to your model using things like a simple gradient texture try it out if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below is there anything in this video you caught that you learned something new um is there a different way you go about something similar to doing this or do you have an idea for a video something we've never covered before and you think would make a good video tell us about it in the comments down below we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
