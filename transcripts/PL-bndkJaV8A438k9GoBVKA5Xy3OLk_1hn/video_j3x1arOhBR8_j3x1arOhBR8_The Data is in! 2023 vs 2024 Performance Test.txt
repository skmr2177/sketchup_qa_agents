hey everyone Eric here and today we're going to do a little data experiment to find out not just if SketchUp 2024 runs faster than 2023 but if so by how much so we're going to do this little experiment that I'm going to call the benchmark test because that's something that came from a forum post so if I kind of pull this up here there was this for thread a while back in 2022 sorry in 2020 where they were like hey let's let's run this script together and then find out how what what does it show you as far as what is SketchUp returning in terms of frames per second so that's sort of what I mean by Benchmark we're going to see is how much faster SketchUp 2024 displays information so refreshes information via frame rate um on your screen so let's just go ahead and get to it so I'll put this away I'm actually going to put a link to this in the description so if you want to try this yourself um you can after seeing how I do it you can download the SketchUp file and it gives you we're going to do this together it's going to give you instructions on how you can run your own sort of benchmark test and see how fast SketchUp is operating for you so once you've downloaded that file I've got it up here now again don't shoot the messenger I didn't model this maybe it's from 3D warhouse maybe it came from the author of The benchmark test but the point is is that this file has Shadows and it has transparency you can't see it there's some vegetation in here so just some things that you might see profiles are turned on some stuff that you might see you know in a typical um model that you're working on and of course that's sort of what we're using as The Benchmark so here are some instructions that come with the file it says open window Ruby console so I'm going to go ahead and do that I am starting in 2024 by the way but if you think it'd be more fun to start do this in 2023 in fact I'm asking myself here because I'm the only one in the room so I think it's probably better that we start this in 2023 because what we want to do is work our way up not down so let's see what 2023 does in this benchmark test I'm going to close this file I just want to make sure that I'm kind of wiping it out that I'm starting fresh so I'm going to go file open recent and there's that test time display file it's going to say it's locked it's only because that I have it open in 2024 as well um that's okay I don't think that affects anything so what we're going to do is we're going to follow the instructions now we're going to go window Ruby console and we're going to type this in as a little snippet of Ruby code so extension developer Ruby console and we're just going to type this in we're going to say test. time and then underscore display if I type that in correctly and when I'm ready I hit enter or return to run the test now that's this basically gives us our results and it ran 72 frames took 2.4 seconds which means that it's 29.5 frames per second now you might think 29.5 frames per second that's pretty good right that's kind of what you see when you're watching a film and I would say that's fine here I am working on the model I don't see any issues um I've got my shadows and profiles and all that stuff turned on there's nothing stopping me from working in version 2023 with 29 or at 29 frames per second it's perfectly uh reasonable but what I do want to do is just compare not just what 2023 can do but I want to show you a new Boost that is part of 2024 and then talk a little bit about why 2024 Works differently the way it does so let's switch I'm going to switch over here they look the same but this is 2024 and what I want to do is I'm just going to close this file just want to make sure that I'm starting with a fresh file that I didn't do anything to it so I'm going to open recent I'm going to open that exact same file and there it is and I'm going to maximize it again I want to make things make sure all things being equal and then what I want to do is before I run this I want to come up here in settings because I want to talk about what makes the two of them different and you may already know this you may have seen this in our sort of what's new in 2024 video but if you come down to Graphics you can see that there's this new section under SketchUp uh this is some preferences so I'm in the system settings or preferences and then under Graphics there's this thing called use new graphics engine so the new graphics engine is unique to 2024 and it's kind of a rewrite of how SketchUp Works under the hood I don't know that much information about it uh to be honest you know I I model but I'm not the developer so I'm going to leave it at that I'm just going to say yes I want to use the new graphics engine um and again if it's giving you any problems if you have a different setup than than me you can always switch back to the classic Graphics engine at any time I'm going to stick with the new one so that said that's the difference between 2023 and 2024 let's go ahead and run that same thing the same little benchmark test I'm going to go extensions developer Ruby console and then I'm going to type in that same thing time. testore display and then a little nervous here because I hope it works you know the way that I hope that I think it's going to I'm going to hit enter or return and I don't even need to look at the data I think if you saw that first one you can see that it spun around quite a bit faster now I've got multiple files open and things like that I'm I'm obviously screen recording so I'm using quite a bit of my processor and you can see the result here at 144 frames per second now I also have my calculator here so if we did some math I could type in 144 / 29 and see that that's a five times boost or five times more performant than 2023 and that's just my particular computer of course your numbers are going to vary based off of your display that you're using your display resolution the model that you're working on and of course the hardware under the hood specs of your particular machine so I'm actually working on a machine um it's iMac Pro from 2027 2017 excuse me and uh so it's not even a new machine 2020 2017 that's a few years old and it seems to be doing okay what I going do is is before I wrap this up um I want to take it one step further so when I say I'm working on old machine and 2024 is working much better for me I want to kind of give a little bit of an example of what I mean of uh Beyond this little test file that's used just to run uh this display refresh rate or frames per second Benchmark so if I come over here I think I've got a file in here that I'm working on so here's my file this is a little sneak preview of an upcam upcoming marketing campaign that we're working on so I won't say too much about this right now but I will say if you come up here into window and model info and we're just going to check statistics just to kind of see how big this model is so far I'm still working on it so it might get bigger and it's a little over 4 million polygons which kind of makes sense because the way that I used to model I used to think uh that million polygon Mark is where I kind of try to keep things if I can um until over that you might have to think about using tags or using tag visibility or you know what I mean switching to things like using textures but for here I was like you know we're using 2024 let's push the envelope a little bit I'll give you an example if I go and turn my black and white and I turn my hidden geometry you'll notice that these vines that are climbing up the walls um on this building they are full geometry uh each each Leaf is uh its own little component and each flower is made up of a series of petals and the vines themselves are made up of full geometry so not textures or anything like that same thing for everything that's coming out of the planter boxes and if you go inside to the coffee shop itself you can see I've got various sort of medium to high poly assets to help fill out the Entourage and then um so you can see if I'm moving around here sort of zooming even if I wanted to move her and place her the refresh rate is really quick and snappy and of course the bigger the model to get you might sort of start to see a little bit of that push back but for me I'm not seeing it and I think that tracks because if you think about the fact that I used to kind of use a million polygons as like my own threshold of keeping things you know around well if this is five times more performant and I'm running now a nearly 5 million polygon model and I'm still having I'm still having no trouble at all with hidden geometries and I even have AO turned on that I wouldn't have in 2023 so I think with all things considered I'm definitely seeing and feeling the snappiness and the advantage of the new graphics engine of course if I was to disable that I might see slight difference but why would I do that I like the new graphics engine I'm going to keep using it so I'm going to stop there because this is um if you you've seen the what's new in 2024 video we've covered AO we've covered the new graphics engine but the big thing here is just putting some numbers behind it so looking at that difference between 29 frames per second and 144 now I ran this test a couple different times I got all the way up to 168 so again depending on what I'm doing in the background at the time might those numbers might change so I would kind of encourage you to check that out yourself maybe there's some things you want to do to play with see if you can get those numbers up if you're like running a bunch of applications in the background or you're using a different monitor something like that but it's just kind of something that for me it's nice to know it's not something that I'm guessing is it feeling faster is it going to stay faster as I continue to build my model and get more and more more detailed of course it's going to stay it's going to hang it's going to hang with you and it's going to say you want to keep going you want to go big uh you don't have to go home you can go big and you can stay here write in SketchUp and keep working on your awesome model so with that I'm going to to leave you there I'm going to say let me know what you think in the comments uh if you if I got something wrong if you've tried it and you're getting a different result I'd love to see what your benchmark is again that link to this file is going to be in the description run it yourself and let me know so don't forget to give us that thumbs up if you learned something new uh if you haven't already subscribe so you get all this stuff in your inbox as they come out as they're released and as always U thanks for watching see you next time [Music]
