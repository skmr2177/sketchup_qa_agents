hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about scaling so I said scaling not quite as simple as like just using the scaling tool what I'm actually talking about is going in and taking something and making it a specific size like an exact scale so uh not necessarily like make it bigger just make it smaller 50% size it was like if I want to make something exactly a specific Dimension a specific scale we'll take a look at how to do that right now all right so as with most things in SketchUp there's a couple different ways I could go about this so here I have some rulers I chose rulers because they have to be a specific size uh based on what's here you can see they're very very big right so this is supposed to be 150 mm I'm not a metric guy as you know but I will say that I'm pretty sure 150 mm is nowhere near this big so these are obviously modeled very large so we've talked about this on some other videos there are cases we we in general with SketchUp if we're doing like an architectural model we do recommend modeling full size it's the easiest way to go about it but there are situations where you might model larger or smaller than full size so if I have something that's real small with a lot of small small detail uh I might have to scale up when I model so that's looks like these were maybe modeled extra large to uh allow for a bunch of small detail little tick marks that kind of stuff the other thing would be if I was modeling something super big I might have to bring it down so if I wanted to you know I don't know model a planet or something I might model that much smaller than it is regardless if I ever model something outside of the standard size and those of you who watch our live models may know that I tend to hop in and just start modeling to get my shapes in and I don't worry about specific sizes sometimes until later on uh there may be a point where you have to scale something or or change the size of it so I have a couple different rulers here so the one at the top you can see goes from zero all the way up to 150 this is 140 plus there's 10 tick marks 150 millim now there is a scale command and we have a scale command for a reason to scale things that's right so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this I'm going to select it on the outside you see I'm on the outside of the component if I double click I come in here and then I actually have some the tick marks the numbers the geometry all separate I'm going to select on the outside of that so the the outside container and I'm going to click on scale all right so with scale you have all these sets of handles right so I can I can go in and I can scale and we've done again this is in we have a a Square One video for the scale tool it's super simple how it works a lot of times when we use scale we do percentages so if I grab uh an a corner like this I start scale it down and say I want to go to like 05 and see down there in the scale in the corner right there it's scaling down and I could type in 0.5 it would make it half as big or I could type two which would make it twice as big but what we want is a specific scale we want from the end to end to be 150 mm so what I would do in that case is I grab this middle one see it's it's really important that I grab the middle one CU what I want to tell it is from that opposite handle to this handle is exactly 150 mm so I'm going to click and start dragging this now I don't want to squish it and make it 150 mm so I'm going to tap the modifier key to keep this scaled so in this case it is shift so if I hold shift I'm dragging down like this and I'm going to release it and then then I'm going to type the exact scale I want I want that to be 150 mm so 150m enter and there it goes little teeny tiny now that is from this side to this side 150 mm or just under six inch so that works great for this one look how small it is look how big this is so obviously this one's going to be an issue right if I take this and I go all right scale it down and we're going to go this way do the exact same thing shift scale that direction and type 150 mm all right what happens with that well it scaled it down now my things are like really far apart so let's gra let's grab this guy right here let's go move him over here and you'll see right away end to end they're the same see that so let's grab this guy right by the end and we'll put it right up next to this one and and N to end they're exactly the same which means something's not right here right because this is not 150 M this is 1 mm plus whatever this is 20 something more millimeters out here to the end so that's not going to work in this case this is wrong so let's look out here we have one more I want to scale this so that it is 150 mm from the end of the ruler to this Mark without to mess with what's over here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to double click that's going to open up the ruler so I'm in now this is where I have like I said these different these different groups that have this other stuff in here and what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab my tape measure tool not scale but tape measure and I'm going to go from this corner zoom in here at that corner and I'm going to click to so right now uh I'm going to come to right there and I'm going to click right there and it did give me see it gave me that that uh that guide there uh I'm going to hit command z um actually I'm going to back up one more step this is a copy of this component that I scaled so I'm going to go ahead right click and say make unique so that's going to say that uh if I make a change here it's not going to mess with this little guy I have up here either so by making it unique I did that and then I'm going to go all right one more time so what I'm going to do is I'm going to down here I have the option of I can click option I'm on Mac so option to toggle create guides if I tap option once see that little plus goes away plus says make a guide without the guide I'm just in tape measure mode and I'm going to click here and I'm going to click right here and then type 150 mm and hit enter it's going to come up and say do you want to resize the active group that's the group I'm in I'm going to hit yes o it got small let's check it out let's zoom in here yeah that looks like it could be right so if I go from here to here yeah just about 6 in and if I go grab oh really got to zoom out I'm grab both these just bring them down here closer where is it there we are all right so if I grab this one not the one I know is wrong I'm not GNA I'm going to kind of abandon that but if I grab this one grab by the corner and then oops grab by the corner put that right up here here what I should see is my marks oh I grabbed the wrong one that's one I didn't want let's grab this one second tries a charm that's what they say all right so if I D grab this one right next to this one I should see my marks lining up all the way down even though I scale them two different ways this guy was scaled with the scale command and this one with the tape measure so depending on the content you have to scale there's different ways to go about it um the general rule of thumb is that container the outside geometry when you hit scale it's going to say okay absolute outside these this is what I'm resizing if that outside geometry can be brought to a specific Dimension then go ahead and use scale if not if you're scaling about some intermediate geometry that falls inside that container then you want to use the tape measure and specify a span across there generally speaking I say grab the biggest span you can and scale it uh if we go real small that's where maybe rounding and that kind of thing like fractional increments might end up causing a problem and you'd be a little bit off so usually I usually scale the biggest thing that I know for a fact is correct uh and well T there we go so uh yeah hopefully that works for you uh let me know if that scaling works for you if you have a different way of scaling I love to hear that too put in the comments down below let me know how you like to scale and uh if you haven't done this before let me know that too let me know this worked out for you and you know while you're clicking around go ahead and like subscribe share this with somebody I really appreciate when you get a chance to do that uh and in the comments if you are leaving a comment let me know about some other ideas of things you might have what are some modeling techniques you've wondered about or something that you found that you thought were good and you want to share with other people we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you
