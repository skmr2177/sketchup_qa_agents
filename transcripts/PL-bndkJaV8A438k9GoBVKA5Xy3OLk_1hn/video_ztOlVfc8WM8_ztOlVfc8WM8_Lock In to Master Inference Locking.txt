hey y'all my name's Tyson this time we're going to do some inference locking uh to build this [Music] roof okay so hopefully um we just did another video on just some basic inference locking practice and it's actually in a file that you can find on the 3D Warehouse it's this file uh skill Builder inference lock practice and it has as well uh this house is uh in it now I'm not claiming that this is a a buildable or a good roof design it is just a good opportunity to practice inference locking so that's what we're going to do let's get to it all right so here's some of the practice examples we did last time um your file may or may not be locked let me unlock this just to make a copy of it or you could simply erase this and start building directly but this is what we're going to try and create and like I say we're just going to draw this by hand using some inference locking methods so I'm going to copy this and then I think it'll be helpful to lock this let's start over here now I'm going to use the protractor tool now the protractor tool when you hover on a corner it's helpful to press the right left and up arrow keys and in this case I'm pressing the right arrow key and I'm going to draw a um a reference line at 35 35° uh most of the rest of these we're going to be using 30° I just want this main roof to be a little bit higher now I'm going to find the midpoint draw up find where that ref uh intersects my inference line then draw this erase that Center Point and then use Push Pull and let's go Ahad and push it uh back to this second Edge over here now we need to resolve that there's a a little indent here so I'm going to click to draw a line hover for a moment and that's going to give me that purple line now I could use the shift key to lock that I could press the down arrow to lock that or I don't actually have to lock it I could carefully just meet this Edge I tend to lock anyway just to be sure and then I lock to um to the roof now let's use Push Pull oops that's pull that forward and then do this again click hover bind the parallel line tap the arrow key or hold the shift key and lock and we need to draw one more Edge down here to fill that face in but now use the push pull tool and this as well and then we can clean up these edges finally let's just do that in the opposite direction click hover find it lock it and move to that surface now now that we've got this that's all well and good but I think let's change up the roof on this one so I'm going to push this back erase that edge push this back and erase some of that work that we just did there's an edge here we can erase it if you locked your base here um i' probably be useful to fill this surface in so I'm just going to draw over the top just to fill that surface now let's use the protractor tool again and this time I want the green Direction so I can find it carefully or tap the left Arrow key and this time I am using 30° and again this is is just sort of random examples I I know Roofing tends to be um slopes and and other things um and I was a little bit sloppy here look I'm not matched up to my so I I better undo that I can lock that up that direction and reference so do that if you'd like use the inference locking because that's what we're doing all right let's push this across I'm going to reference this point here and this time click hover find that direction lock it and then finish this out all right now we need to get these two roofs uh resolved together and what we can do is use the move tool now I haven't grouped all of this and it it may be useful to do so and then work inside that group I'm going to continue without doing that um but you may want to do that in E either case you want to be working on your geometry nothing is selected and I'm going to click on this end point which allows me to move it now nothing is locked but I can find the red Direction but I don't know how far to go unless I tap the right arrow key or lock with the shift Arrow I'm sorry the shift key once I hit the shift key or the right Arrow it in uh invokes inference locking and now I see I hover over this surface and it locks right to where that point lines up with that surface and by crossing over this Edge it should automatically have broken this Edge if you didn't fill that surface in earlier you'll probably have an open surface and you'll need to fill it back in but we're going to again use the move tool nothing is selected grab this point tap the right arrow key to lock the red Direction and hover on this roof surface and then let's just erase that all right let's do it over here this time on a diagonal but it's going to be the same thing we've been doing protractor tool I want to carefully be sure I'm on the diagonal 30° Center Point or midpoint and draw in the edges use Push Pull push it back to this corner and then we could use the line tool or the move tool so I could start drawing from this point lock to this Edge so I'm holding the hovering over this Edge hold the shift key lock to it and then draw this out or we could do what we did before use the move tool and in this case I'll hover on this Edge hold the shift key but I haven't clicked on anything to move click on this point and then hover on this surface to line it up same result again let's say we want 30° here find our midpoint draw our edges and if you want to practice with the line tool draw all of this in with the line tool so I'm going to move in the green Direction maybe tap the left arrow and by hovering on this roof it knows exactly uh where to meet up and same thing here maybe I'll draw back tap the left Arrow key doesn't matter if I hover on this Edge or this roof because it's going to be the same click I fill that in now how are we going to resolve these two roofs well let's say let's start a line from here so I'm starting a line then I'm going to hover on this roof surface and hold the shift key now I'm locked to that surface and that means I can hover on this Edge so I know where this would come down to meet this Edge click let go of the shift key and then I'll just finish this out and we should be able to erase this there we go uh finally let's hit let's get to this side so again 30° midpoint eraser Push Pull and then use the move tool lock that and move it back now in this case I not again not that it's a good design but I I let's just to make things a little bit interesting for the purpose of inference locking we let's say we want to create this uh piece of roof that is all part of this one surface so if we wanted to do that what should we do well let's take oh we've got a lot of uh a lot of guidelines going on so I'm going to delete all guidelines which I've got on a keyboard shortcut but you could erase them as well all right so let's we've got our roof let me I could do this a couple ways I'll just hover over this surface hold the shift key and then as I move up it's going to say where that would intersect and then down here I'm going to do the same I'm going to start an edge but then I'll just hover because I know it will need to be parallel to this one and then find sort of where it's going all the way through the roof hold the shift to lock that and then back click and then it's kind of just a connect the dots exercise and as we erase that out we should be able to clean up those surfaces and if you hadn't already probably be useful to group this now from here you could just you know keep on going uh say uh uh I want to move this back so that's it's parallel here but I don't know quite what that would be so I can either create a guideline or I could you know number of things but oops lock it just to be sure and then hover over that edge all sorts of stuff just you know not not that it's a good design again but the point being what can you do to just practice inferencing and practice you know creating different roof forms that's the idea um so hopefully you were able to create this or something like it um so let let us know uh if you were successful in doing that um if you found out any new any new techniques or have suggestions of your own we'd love to have that discussion with you thanks as always y'all uh thanks for joining us do like and subscribe if you have not and we'll see you next time [Music]
