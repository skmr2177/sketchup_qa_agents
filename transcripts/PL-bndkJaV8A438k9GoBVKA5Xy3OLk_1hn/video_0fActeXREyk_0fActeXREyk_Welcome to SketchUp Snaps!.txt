hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around we have something very exciting for you a brand new feature in SketchUp called snaps that's right we just had an update release with SketchUp and along with some new UI changes we introduced a feature called snaps and these are user generated user created control points that are useful with both move and rotate tools it's pretty awesome let's have a look um so if we look at you know just say these shelves they look pretty standard but if I edit one of these there's a bunch of these dots or circles in here and we look at these they're not even all connected to the geometry they can be anywhere in space these are snaps I've created these to help with the placement of these shelves or with placing things on these shelves will learn how to create them but let's have a quick look at a few ways that you might use snaps so let's say we're placing these in a room so let's just create a simple room back here I'm going to worry about exactly how big this is let's just have something that we can place and if I select any one of these shelves and then with the move tool you see those snaps appear I've got on this one these three so I'm going to grab it by that point there and move a copy of it now back here you can see that it's orienting to any surface or I can just place it right here in the corner now if I wanted to create you know more of these shelves lined up and I've got a couple sizes and variations here we could do that but we might need to zoom in to grab a corner move it to a corner such and such here it's going to be really easy I'm just going to move any one of these let's just say grab this one and I'm going to grab it by that point and then I've got this set up to snap right here and then maybe we'll move this one to here and maybe this one will move to here you can see that it just accelerates the process of this type of assembly or moving pieces into place or adjacent to each other and that's just because I happen to set these up this way you can set them up however you want to be useful to you I didn't have to zoom in I don't have to you know be very meticulous about picking just a small point it makes it so much easier here's another example sometimes something like this with all of these round shapes we could assemble this if we were laying out some pipes but it could be um a little bit Troublesome but let's just move one of these back here and in fact just say and we'll put it that configuration now we're going to start to build this out I'm gonna put this one here and let's say let's move a copy of this over here and this one here and that needs to come over like that and then we're going to extend that further let's say here you can see how easy it is to start placing these and putting them correctly because these have snaps to Simply align them together so that makes that process so much better here's another example um several months ago or some time ago I showed this example of the rotate tool and I was showing how when you have geometry that doesn't necessarily you know it'd be difficult to rotate this whole thing based on the base that you can create these sort of help guides that were part of this well that was useful but now with snaps let's say I come in and select these pieces and then I'm going to rotate them and here's a snap and not only is that snap easy to find and planted correctly but it's also aligned with the arm of this you know robotic arm then I could say well let's just grab these rotate these here's another snap and I'll grab these pieces and rotate them and here's another snap and again it's lined up with the arm it makes this whole process just much much better so that's all well and good it's very cool again you can use snaps you can have just a few of them like this where I've created a snap on each side for lining these up with other shelves and then back here on the base in the Middle where this would line up with the wall or if you want to get more complicated this one I put snaps on each shelf to make it simple to move you know picture frames and vases and things that you would put on the shelves it's up to you that's the beauty of it so let's come back here let's make a few snaps Snaps are embedded in your groups and components so to make one simply going to edit this group and then right click and say make edit snaps and then and you can see this just orients anywhere to make a snap is either two clicks or a double click so let's just make one very quick here I'm going to double click that's it it made a snap it has this um rotation indicator but if I close this group and make this a copy now if I move this see that dot shows up and I can start moving this around and snap it to this snap even some of those snaps back here right very easy to make so let's refine that a little bit I can select this snap and delete it just hit delete on the keyboard make how it snaps this time I want to be a little more precise so I'm going to hover over this midpoint maybe put it right there in the center and I could click once and then you see it gives me an the ability to sort of Orient the snap in different ways typically if you're on a Surface like we were here I would just double click but if I click out here it's created the similar snap that we had before now we could continue to create these of course I'm just going to double click say here and you see I put a snap in the wrong place it's easy enough to select the snap and delete it now when you're creating snaps here's something to be aware of and I've accidentally uh free to snap back here I'll select that and delete it when you're creating snaps you can see that I've edited I've put my snap right here one level deep well you might say well these blocks if I made them you know smartly they might be components they are so why wouldn't we just embed that in the component here's the thing for now again that maps are very cool they'll be very useful but this is a version one of snaps and it turns out that if we let me undo let me just copy and delete that snap then I'll edit this and paste it so I've put it in here it should be that yep that snap is in those components but I've embedded it now two levels deep inside this group snaps don't necessarily work that well deeply embedded and that's a feature that we know will be useful it's something that we hope to improve over time but this is version one and be aware that if you're gonna embed snaps deeply within nested groups or components they don't work as well you can see my snap is not sort of it's still there it still works just not as well so be aware of that and try to keep your snaps at a high level just on one level deep again something that may improve over time also it's worth mentioning that because snaps are a version one um you can look forward to seeing other improvements we know there's a lot of things that can be improved and we want your feedback on that we have plenty of our own ideas but we want your feedback as well still once you've created some snaps let's look at how we can manipulate them further now we can simply select if I'm careful I can select these snaps and if I wanted to I could sort of move them out treat them a little bit like regular geometry and that will allow me to identify copy this and then put it back it orients within any of these another way to manipulate snaps is if I right click and say make edit snaps the first mode is creation mode of creating new snaps if we look down here in our tool hands for me I'm on a Mac that'd be option key it'd probably be the control key on a PC if I hit that it the icon changes so I can create new snaps hit the um control key on PC option key on Mac and I can just edit snaps and hit it again and I can erase just snaps and this eraser only works on snaps so there's a couple ways to edit your snaps once you've created them if I go to here the edit mode one of the things that's very important about how you create snaps is the front and back base well what does that mean see these were all created with the front face out but I'm going to again Watch down here when I'm editing so creation editing I'm going to hover over this snap and press the command key again on I'm on a Mac so this will I think be the ALT key and that snap is reversing each snap has a front face and a back face so I'm going to change that so now this is a the back face is out the reason that's important if we look at this again this snap you know is front face out now this one is the back faces out Snaps are going to orient to any geometry but if you're trying to do a snap to a snap it's going to go front face to front face or back face to back face so if I copy this and then snap here well that's front to front to front this one we changed it is front to back so you do need to be aware of the snap and whether the front or back face is pointing outwards or you know inwards again it's your call that's the beauty is you get to set it up how you want just be aware of that behavior that if you want to align snaps to snaps you want to try and get front face to front face and again to edit those we're just going to edit our little group here make edit snaps and I'm going to toggle through my different modes hover right over this and reverse it with a shortcut key so again pay attention down here to the tool hints so that is it um one more thing while you're editing these you can change the default rotation and this will be the default Arm about which this snap will rotate so you can see I put this one Inward and maybe we put this one inward and now if I go to the rotate tool and click on this it's going to have that Arm based where we oriented it so this one was facing Inward and this one was facing upwards all right I think that's enough for now what I'm gonna do is another skill Builder that will push out um next week and we'll go a little more into editing and copying and manipulating snaps this was just an introduction to what they are and how you can start using them and hopefully you're as excited as I am about the possibilities this is going to give us I I am excited for these again I'm I'm not trying to say they're they're perfect at this point we know that they're not we know that there's some improvements that can be made also this is a desktop feature you can look forward to seeing it in our other versions of SketchUp uh web and iPad but it's in this release not there quite yet so when that's coming I do not know um but we want your feedback certainly uh on what it is right now again the latest version of the desktop release of SketchUp very cool do leave us feedback here in the comments leave us feedback in the SketchUp forums let us know how we can improve snaps because we want to make this you know absolutely a very valuable new feature I think it already is but you know keep going with that so with that let us know what you plan to do with snaps as well be curious because these are just a couple simple examples um and we can we can't wait to get your feedback thanks you all that'll do it for now again be sure to like And subscribe if you haven't and let us know what you think and we'll see you next time [Music]
