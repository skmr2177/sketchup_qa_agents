hey everybody Eric here and today I want to share with you some of my tips for combining both 2D and 3D objects into one component in order to get the best of both worlds when creating floor plans right here in SketchUp so when I say Best of Both Worlds I mean that whether you like it or not we have to work at some point with 2D information even though we're a 3D modeling app and I say information both on the front end so you might get something like a four plan that was drawn in an application like CAD in which case you have CAD blocks which then become SketchUp components that's a 2d block that you're starting with before you begin to work in 3D whether you're building something from scratch or you're replacing it with an object from 3D warehouse now on the other end we also want to think about when we go to layout we might be taking our custombuilt Furnishing or our floor plan and then communicating the design with somebody else also again in 2D so whether it's on the front end the middle the back end we're going to work back and forth between 2D and 3D and I want to share with you my process for doing that right now so I've got a floor plan here um this is a co-working space it's kind of a commercial interiors that we're going to work on and I've got a few objects that some of these things I built from scratch and some things that I found online so what I want to do is kind of cover a what I think is a common workflow which is that you're starting with a floor plan that maybe was done in a program like Cad and then now you need to turn it into a 3D model so if I'm going to change my camera perspective to Ortho for this and I may be switching back and forth but just so you know because we're talking about floor plans I'm probably going to look at it in plan view so looks pretty good in plan view obviously we're SketchUp we're 3D when you tilt it yeah not so much so let's go ahead and get started converting our 2D plan into a 3D one before I do that I want to kind of also state or show that I have two tags set up one of them is called Furniture 2D and one is 3D and that's because I want to separate I want to kind of pre-think about organizing my PL plan information on two different tags and you'll see why here so let's just go ahead and do it I'm going to take this table I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to go into my table group and I'm going to go grab find this table symbol which is really just a rectangle and paste my table right in to the table and chairs component and you can see because it's a component it repeats it for all of them now before I pop out of here I am going to assign this 3D table to my 3D Furnishings tag and if I want to I don't have to but sometimes I will turn color by tag on just to make sure that that was done properly and you can see I've already got my my table assigned to the 2D tag now if it's not for some reason we can just go ahead and undo that I'll just undo that step just to show you how easy that is so we can go ahead and assign the 2D and then you can see the color change to Blue and the 3D once again and the color changes to this kind of yellow color that just shows me that I can then toggle them back and forth or on and off so let's do um a couple more let's grab this plant and this chair so let's do the chair first show you how kind of easy this is go back into that component I copied that chair I'm just go and paste this here right there and I'm probably going to need to rotate that 90Â° so it's sort of facing the right way and then there you go now it's pink by default that's untagged that just kind of tells me hey pink means untagged go ahead or red depending on how you perceive this color I'm going to go ahead and put that on the 3D tag again same thing super simple and let's do one more while we're at it just because I think it helps to be able to see a few different examples this one has not been placed on a tag so what we want to do is grab this one again same thing 3D for the plant and 2D for the symbol so when we switch to plan View using keyboard shortcut for that you can see right now we've got both of them overlapping so what I want to do is I'm probably not going to show both at the same time I have to decide which that I want to show let's go and turn the 2D off and assume that hey I did all this work making this FL plan in 3D why would I not show that in 3D well one reason is because while it looks pretty good um this may or may not read as a plant first of all if you look at the plant symbol and second of all the chair well fairly simple it is a 3D chair and so if I try to add something like Dimensions to this and say okay I want this chair I want these chairs spaced you know certain you can see I'm having trouble finding it's trying to snap to all this sort of hidden geometry because this is a 3D chair after all so if I started if I snap here to here my Dimension string may be a little bit off so I'm having a little bit of trouble maybe I can find that Center Point if I zoom in but again now I'm not doing my Dimensions I wouldn't normally do them here I would do them in layout but just dimensioning to a 3D object might be a little bit trickier so if I compare that to the 2D version and I switch to my Dimension you can see I have no problems at all it just grabs that Center Point and there we go we're good to go so same thing here if I wanted to go from the edge of the table to say the center of the chair that's super super easy because I'm dimensioning on just a 2d a very simple sort of 2D object and besides Dimensions also just visually the Style by having them separate you can just kind of control the visibility like for example this plant reads more as like a potted Palm whereas if you go to the 3D symbol you know with all this extra geometry and stuff it may or may not read the way you want it to so just something to think about again we can always combine this method and you can have some objects that you say let's let the 3D read that works better or others let's let the 2D read or in this case of the table if you have just a rectangle doesn't really matter what reads um for the table um unless of course you want to show the chairs underneath it in which case having them sit on the same plane is the advantage so I want to show you one more example just to kind of reiterate this point and it's but for a slightly different reason I'm going to grab this couch over here and I want to go ahead and place this couch inside of this couch group or this couch component going to place that in there and I'm going to flip that around and there we go okay so now this C isn't super super high poly but if I turn my hidden geometry on you can see that it is high enough that I may not want to send this to layout for example and then if I like rendering my floor plans in Vector mode so that I can get that crisp clean line that can be edited in a PDF editor or something like that this is a little bit more information than I probably need to render in vexter so if I'm rendering in raster that's probably fine but in this case it's I'm I'm basically asking layout to do a lot more work because it has to render every single one of these edges when um it's not really buying me anything when you kind of zoom out and you see it at this level so in this case this would just be another example of and I skipped this step because I was talking but I need to put this on the furniture 3D tag so it disappears and this would just be another example where I'm better off working with the more simplistic 2D symbol rather than the 3D one um that's just going to maybe increase my render times later depending on what I'm trying to do with it so something to think about and lastly like I said is that the 2D um both directions now we can also start with for example if I wanted to start with a 3D object I can also embed a 2d object into this so whether this is handdrawn or imported CAD block I'm just going to grab steel for myself over here I've got this door swing you can also come back later after the fact after your model's built and come in and place 2D objects just got to orient it correctly into the model and then here go uh same thing I would just double check to make sure that this is placed on the 2D tag and I would make sure that this everything else besides those two doors is put on the 3D tag and I will check that the color and that looks pretty good so the cool thing about that is if I wanted to go into plan view like this now I can choose to show the door swing or not just by toggling that tag on and off again if I wanted to add if I wanted to dash that if you want wanted to show that show it is like not really there because it's not physically there it's just kind of a representation of an idea of the Swing um you can always change the line type and I just like being able to control that separately from the 3D object so I want to stop there because I think you get the idea but I do want to also at the same time plug uh if you liked what you learned here or you want to learn a little bit more about this model that I'm working on or that I built the model of where we got the components and where we got the furnishings and how to build some of these objects for from scratch I do want to kind of plug really quick learn. sketchup.com check that out what you're going to get is SketchUp campus has a bunch of free courses for learning um some of our core fundamentals but also some of the more complex industry specific stuff like I just covered here in commercial Interiors so if you click on that course enroll for free and it's got all kinds of cool stuff in addition to the tips that I just shared with you um got a lot more information about starting from scratch and taking a floor plan all the way to the Finish Line I'm going to leave you there I just want to say thanks for watching as always I hope these tips are helpful if you work a different way if you've got a different way to do it and you say hey actually combining two things in one component is not a good idea and here's because here's why I'd like to know that so leave a comment below let us know what you think either way because these videos as much as we like making them uh we like it better when it's something you want to see so I'm going to say thanks and I will see you all next time [Music]
