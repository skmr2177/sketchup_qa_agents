hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about the intersect with model command so a lot of people like to talk about solid tools and solid tools is really cool because you can create solid shapes and you can intersect them or cut it cut them out of each other and there's a lot of really great ways to make geometry using solid tools but in order to use solid tools you have to have modeled solids and there's some cases where solids don't necessarily make a lot of sense um situations where you might have a surface that needs to intersect another surface instead of you know a bunch of solid pieces there's solids are great for what they do but there's occasions where I just want to know where two surfaces meet instead so we're going to model a circus tent using the intersect with model command all right so here's where we're headed um a couple things going on here so down at the bottom here I have this uh hexagonal base and then I have these nice swoopy shapes going up to the middle and then just for fun I put some decorations on here I I the original model I had had a whole bunch of of decorations and colors and stuff like that I wanted to keep it a little I toned it down a little bit so all I what I have here is some edges I do have to go to my styles I have my edges turned on and set to color by material with color by material means you can actually apply colors to an individual Edge so rather than saying you know all color all edges are the same color I can actually go and choose which ones I want to have so if I want these swooping lines kind of things on here separate from the material itself so this these faces are set that looks pretty cool it's like that um these faces are totally separate from from the edges that got created so let's talk about how to make this let's make something just like this right next to it so I'm going to start by going into my polygon tool so I'm going to go grab polygon I'm going to do a six-sided polygon and I'm just going to pull a shape out on the green axis something around the same size I'm not really too concerned about that sizes Dimensions to be honest all right I'm going to pull that up a little way so I have something like this make it Hollow on the inside and I'll triple click and make it a group I'm making it a group because I am going to create multiple pieces of geometry that I want to intersect with each other and I want them to intersect I do not want them to merge the default thing that you know SketchUp does is it merges geometry and I don't want to do that so what I'm going to do now I'm going to draw an edge from here I'm going to take that back so it hits the middle which is the those inference right here I'm holding down shift tool to lock to the red axis and I'm going to inference this point right here I'm going to draw a line up like that okay so there we go now I'm gonna grab an arc go with an arc from here to here and I'm just going to kind of eyeball a good Arc something like that there we go and take that and we'll pull it across the other Edge and then I'm going to get rid of this geometry underneath so all I have is this ramp shape a triple click and make that its own group now what I want to do is I want to figure out where if this this same slope was coming off of all six sides how would these intersect so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this I'm going to hit rotate and I'm going to my up Arrow oops rotate up Arrow to lock to the blue axis I'm going to inference off a middle point and then I'm going to grab from this corner I hit option to copy to this corner I'm going to hit 2x because I want two copies so now when I did that I have my original one was right here this one in the middle and then one on the other side so if I look at this middle one I can see these two pieces cross over it so what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to go into this face so I do have if I go to view component edit I have high-breasted model turned on that means when I double click into a group or component everything else disappears I'm going to grab this base I'm going to right click and say intersect face with model that's going to even though I can't see it it's going to show me where those two other sloped surfaces hit this one so now if I just erase these two lines and these two lines I have just 1 6 of my tent roof so if I click outside here go ahead and just erase these two there we go I got that and I'm going to just copy that with rotate the same way to the other one so I'm going to hit rotate go to this top Point hit up to lock the blue axis click there click one corner option look at the second corner 5x enter and there we go I have my my roof a little different slope but you can still see what it is Okay so I did create my original arcs on the side without using any kind of uh intersect I just grabbed my arc command through one two three arcs like that I wanted them to all be bold so I grabbed the surface that that created and deleted both of those and then I just grabbed all three lines grab my paint bucket picked a red color and came in here oops missed it undo there we go I got that time and I just colored them all red and then it was a simple same thing I just did to to get this piece repeating I just copied it from one corner option to the next five x so there's no intersection with these lower produce right here I don't know what you'd call these things these things these these hangy thingies I did want to emulate that same kind of three Banner folds whatever you call it hanging down up here though so what I did was I came in here and I drew one line across like this um actually I did this on this so I could stay on uh a reference line so I'm on the parallel to the green line right now I'm gonna draw a circle and I am going to hit the left I'm sorry right arrow to snap to red and draw a circle out like that I can erase this Edge and just pull this out all right now so if I intersect right now I'll get one swoopy line that follows this circle but I want two I want the same thing going on here so I'm going to come here let's draw a line across here for my reference and then I'll draw an arc like this and a second Arc between those two like that now what I can do is this is where I'm gonna it's gonna get a little it's gonna get a little weird here so I'm going to grab it and I'm going to push that through all the way back to here so what that just created was three surfaces that cross the the top of my tent this surface this surface and this surface so when I intersect right now there's a weird looking shape but all it's going to give me are those three lines so I'm going to grab this component I'm not going to go into it I don't want to break the geometry I want to create loose lines like I created over here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this face right here the whole thing the whole component or I'm sorry it's not it's a group I'm going to right click and say intersect face with model now I'm going to grab I'm gonna grab this delete it get rid of that get rid of that and look what I got now see these edges these edges are Standalone they're outside of the component so I got a component it's not broken so now I can just grab all of these edges same thing I'll go to paint bucket tool Actually I don't even need to pre-select uh I could do it one at a time but by doing it all at once there's a chance I can hit them all at the same time and turn them all red what probably makes sense to do is to grab that make it a group and then I can just grab it and rotate it same thing go from here option to this side and say 5x enter and there we go I got that geometry sitting on top there because it's an intersection from outside it is its own geometry and I don't have to worry so if I decide I want to come in here and I want to color the tops of this tint uh yellow and blue or something like that I go put my yellows in grab my my blue and that doesn't affect my red lines because they're their own geometry because they were created outside of this and I didn't have I did all this all this intersecting with no solids so something something to think about for sure uh next time you have to create geometry that falls on a curve or it falls on something where you don't have solids to create that intersection a little bit of a weird example but I was trying to think of something that really stood out and I could you know really see those intersections um and I just arcs intersecting arcs just for whatever reason I mean I guess that could have been done no see the the thing the nice thing about not using solid intersections two is that you can have that Standalone geometry those edges can now be their own thing so whereas with uh intersecting with something like solids it's destructive something's going to break you're going to have your either lose a cutter or the the piece that's being intersected is going to change in some way so the other nice thing about intersecting outside of context outside of group or component is you can create that geometry without actually destroying or impacting what's inside the object so check it out try it out uh come back here and let me know what you think if you've never done this before if you have done an important have a specific use case let me know about that too if you like this video do click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe so we can tell you next time we make a video and like I was just mentioning tell me in the comments what you think about this have you used this specific set of commands do something else other than a circus tent odds are good uh or do you have a different way of going about it like making these videos a lot but we'd like them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you foreign
