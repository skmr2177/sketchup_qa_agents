hey guys I'm Aaron and today I'm going to show you how to use scenes and tags to make a chasing light animation like the one happening right behind me happy holidays so we've said it before on here uh SketchUp is not by itself an animation tool it's not the tool you would buy to you know rig characters and make them move or do much more than flying through a scene SketchUp is primarily a 3D modeling tool it does have some basic animation though like I said using scenes or tags for visibility you can move through a model or make a model pieces of a model you know show up and disappear that kind of thing and we're going to show how to use those things those those things I just mentioned to uh do a quick animation of lights so let's hop in and do it okay so I have a pretty simple setup here I have a little little facade of a house right here and then uh that's not like I insulted it you're nothing but a facade of a house um and then I have this string of lights so what we're going to do is we're going to make three copies of this string of lights with different lights lit up on each copy so I'm going to do a couple things here first we're going to create three tags so I'm going to make lights a we'll call them lights I guess it really doesn't matter what I call them I could call them just a for that matter but uh anyhow I'm going to spell lights correctly because because I can well actually sometimes I can't but I'm going to do it I did it I forced myself to all right so I have three uh different tags right here and now I'm going to make three copies of this right here so I'm going to use move um and I'm just going to option copy one over here I'm use this this uh overhang right here as my distance to copy that way I can get it right back to where I need it here and I'm going to make one more copy I don't have to actually copy these out separate to make this work what I'm doing uh it's just a little easier to visualize if I put them out here like this all right so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab this first one this one is going to go to a the second one is going to go to B and this third one is going to go to C all right so now they're all on a different so as I turn these on and off I'll be able to see that I can just see which one I want all right now what I can do is I can actually take these and we're going to scoot them back to where they were like I said I really I really only did that to make it easier to visualize as I was making making those three copies but now you believe that there's three copies they're all they're exact same geometry in the exact same place so I can't see them more than one at a time but what I'm going to do now is I'm going to turn off B and C so now I have just lights a all right so now I'm going to double click and let me look at one of these light bulbs so what this light bulb consists of is a simple is just a single single mesh inside this component uh the outs or the tops of these are painted green you can see and the bulb it self is the default material so what that means is if I come in here and I bring up my paint bucket and I grab like a gray color a little bit darker and I color this component the Green's going to stay green but anything that's the default material will then turn that gray so this makes it real quick and easy to color two leave one color two leave one color two leave one color two leave one etc etc etc so I work across this whole thing uh doing it like this and actually it's occurring to me right now that I unintentionally this was not this was honestly not on purpose but I made the perfect number of segments and the perfect number of bulbs that I could have made each of these Loops a different component and it would have worked perfectly I didn't think about that but I did that so way to go subconscious awesome modeling eron all right so there we go so now I have gray gray white gray gray white gray gray white all the way across there so I'm going to do now is I'm going to turn off lights a and I'm turn on lights B again going into that in this case I'm going to go the same thing grab my paint bucket leave a white one and then say gray gray white gray gray white gray gray white so I'm going to work my way across here same way just a couple of quick quick quick clicks quick clicks um this idea by the way is something that came out of one of our live modeling sessions we do live modeling every Friday well most Fridays uh on our YouTube Facebook and Linkedin channels so you should come check us out because we talk about cool stuff and come up with ideas like this that we end up making a reality later on all right so now I'm going to take that one turn that off turn on C and then this one I'm going to go put a gray here leave that one white and gray gray gray gray okay and work my way across there so what I should end up with in this case if I've done everything correct which I do believe I have I should have three different versions of gray and light white bulbs and if I flip them on and off quick enough I should see it look like I'm moving through here so let's check it out so start with a my third bulb's lit C my first and fourth I'm sorry b c my second and fifth so yeah that looks like it's going to be correct so here's what I got to do now now what I need to do is I need a scene connected to each of these tags so with lights a turned on I'm going to say make a new scene that's it actually that's not it I lied I totally lied that's not it at all what is it I want to expand this down I want to make sure with this scene the only thing I keep is visible tags so I'm going to turn off all the these other attributes I don't care about any of this stuff I don't want the scene to remember any of this stuff or Force any of it on me all I want it to do is control visibility of tags and then let's update that visible tags only now I'll go from A to B and make a new scene B to C make a new scene and that's it we've done all the work now we just have to play the animation so I'm going to go over to view I'm going to go to animation I'm going to go to settings um I want to turn off scene transitions I usually have that turned off anyhow and I want a fairly quick light Chase here so I'm going to do something like 0.5 seconds all right and going close that and now I should be able to go to view animation and play and what will happen here is it's just going to go through each scene and you see as each scene one two 3 one two 3 each one's just toggling each tag on and off and because we didn't connect this to anything other than tags we can actually move through the model and the animation keeps going it does pause for a second if I'm you know moving something you know moving the whole model so it has to redraw everything it does take a second to pause there but then as soon as I land again I can see that animation continue so my point is I don't have to do this from one point of view I come over here and get Teddy in the foreground keep the animation going I can come down here and look up at it like my kid physically and and then uh yeah there we go I got it it's it's animating my lights that's all there's to it so again not a true animation in the sense of I'm not setting values of each of these or moving things in 3D space but an animation in that kind of like a cell animation I'm flipping from one view to the next to the next and creating this illusion of Chasing Lights moving through my model pretty cool so there you go like I said that's it's not a complicated process it's actually pretty easy Once you know the steps and if you set it all up right there's really a lot of things you can do with simple animations uh inside a SketchUp this is kind of a fun one this is like I said this came out of a live stream could we make them the lights on on a sign we made blink uh and this is how you'd go about that I thought it' be fun considering the time of year to do Holiday Lights as opposed to the Las Vegas sign which is what we were working with originally but process would be the same so I hope you like that and if you did like that click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos around here each and every week and to be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly more than anything though leave us a comment down below is this new to you did you just learn this do you have a different way you would have gone about this or do you have another idea that you think would make a good video leave it in the comments we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when sh something you want to see thank you [Music]
