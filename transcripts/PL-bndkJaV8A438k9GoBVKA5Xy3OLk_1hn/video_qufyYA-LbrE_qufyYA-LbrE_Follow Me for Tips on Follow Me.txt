hey y'all my name is Tyson and this week let's focus on follow me now the follow me tool is like some other SketchUp Tools in that it's pretty versatile and you can do a lot of different things with it also like some other tools it can be a little finicky and sometimes the results are what you'd expect and sometimes they may not be so let's work through a few scenarios that hopefully will give you some Advanced ideas on our follow me will work and making it work for you this is not an introduction to follow me so if you've never used the tool before we do have some videos on that but we're going to push your use of follow me a little further thing let's look at is this typically when you're using follow me you often have a nice obvious place to start if you follow me shape something like this so if I click up here or my path hit follow me which I have as a keyboard shortcut and click rate but sometimes you might have something like this where there's not an obvious path what if we wanted to cut a shape inside here it's easy to draw a shape on the outside but we want to draw shape on the inside not a problem let's just hide this surface I have it on a keyboard shortcut I'm going to hide it and the other tip that I want to make in this example is that you should pretty much always at least I prefer to draw a simple rectangle and then draw your more complex follow me shape it's so much easier to draw on a rectangle than to try and draw especially arcs but even any of these lines out in 3D space so I suggest draw a simple rectangle and then you can draw on that shape now we can simply select this top surface hit follow me and through the edit menu unhide or through a keyboard shortcut you can unhide and that is one way to use follow me on a shape that may not have an obvious starting point all right let's look at our next example uh this is an example of something I was 3D printing recently a little storage box but it's very small and I wanted to put a chamfer on the base of it so I'll select this and hit follow me and click on this little that looks okay oh nope you see it didn't resolve this tight corner and I suspect we're going to get the same here doesn't like these tight corners on this small shape so let me undo and this is a component and that's important because now we're just going to make a copy of this and with that copy we're going to scale it up now I'm not editing the component I'm scaling sort of the outer shell of it but now I'm going to edit the component this larger version and do the same thing select this surface hit follow me and on the larger version it does resolve those tight Corners here and here and this is a trick that's actually useful just any time you're you're using detail in SketchUp and it doesn't quite work the way you'd expect you can make your geometry a component create a much larger scale of it and if we look at our small version just by running those operations on that larger version it also work here this is not a guarantee that you can always resolve a very tight corner with follow me you can create a scenario that just is way too tight but it's worth knowing about that if you are having trouble with small details try scaling it up let's look at our next example this case I'm going to draw an arc here pull this up and I were to try and run this shape on this Arc the results are less than spectacular because follow me is going to follow the path The Arc we drew didn't resolve into this shape very well it didn't resolve into it in a purely perpendicular Direction and so it has this overlap now if this is what we needed we could select some of these surfaces and intersect them and have to clean this up manually but we could do it however if we anticipate that instead when we draw this initial Arc what we can do is simply draw a small starting line that is perpendicular so that one in the green direction that one in the red and then when I draw this Arc we have these little segments that should help this geometry resolve much nicer it's like this this this and this as my path hit follow me and that may be what we had expected initially but now we know why and how to create some small little perpendicular lines and then draw the arc with those as our AIDS in this example let's say we have this geometry and we're working on the interior we want to create some trim well simple enough and we hit follow me that looks great and if all we were doing was working on the inside that may be just fine but it does change the geometry of our walls and maybe we wanted this trim to be separate so let me undo we could do a couple things here now one that you might do is simply select this select these edges and then I could group those and then run this on the inside now that's separated now I didn't have to grab the path and make it part of the group you could but for example if I select the path delete it if I select the path from the outside of the shape group hit follow me I could still right click on the shape group say edit group click and I still get the nice results the follow me is put inside the group so this is great I do want to warn you though there's a this scenario works let me show you a scenario that does not work let me undo that again because typically you might have your walls here grouped separately so I've got the shape group and I've Got The Walls Group but you might say well it should still work right I can select the path hit follow me I'm going to right click and close that group and then right click and edit this group and click to finish it but what I have found as you see this is not what we want when I have tried to do this across groups or components and I get too fancy it does not do what I would expect so let me undo that and instead I'm going to take this I'm going to cut it edit The Walls Group and paste it in place so as long as I'm not closing out of one component opening another and jumping across components here I'm editing the group so I'm still selecting simple path if you go follow me right click edit and click on this for the results so this can be something that is useful just keep in mind that if you're getting really fancy with jumping in and out of components it may not work for you the last example let's look at is something that we see often at least I see it a lot in the uh 3D Warehouse and that is that people don't realize or don't appreciate the need to change the default number of segments in circles and arcs so this again is an example where I would recommend drawing a simple rectangle which I did and then We'll erase what we don't need to follow me that looks good or does it maybe I want more detail in the segments around here but if I look at Hidden geometry there's a whole lot of detail on this lip and that's unnecessary because we've added a lot of unnecessary geometry let me back up I'm going to take the circle go to entity info I'm going to change this maybe to twice as many segments and this top Arc was the default 12 but maybe it only needs four maybe five it's not an exact science how many just be aware and be a little bit proactive in saying okay I don't need that many down here so I'm going to leave these both as 12 though now let's run this again I think this looks better but because that top Edge doesn't have as much geometry even though we increase the segments of the circle we probably have less geometry overall or if it's the similar we have a better looking ball so keep in mind and always adjust your arcs and circle segment count for the best results all right that was a mad rush through several examples and tips for follow me but hopefully something in there was useful to you something you didn't uh weren't aware of before we try and create these videos every week so if you are not please do subscribe but definitely let us know what you thought of this or if you have some other suggestions either for this video tips and tricks for follow me or for any video that we can create and help you on your SketchUp Journey thanks as always see you next time foreign foreign
