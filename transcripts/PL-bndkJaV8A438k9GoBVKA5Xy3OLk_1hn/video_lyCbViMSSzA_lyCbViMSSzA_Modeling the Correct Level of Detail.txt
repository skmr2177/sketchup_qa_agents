hey guys I'm Aaron and today I'm going to talk about excessive geometry so we've talked about this in the past specifically we looked at like architectural models and the example I always give is the kitchen model with a bowl of fruit on the counter and it's there for a render and when it's done your bowl of fruit's like about this big on this full full sheet spread put that little bowl of fruit the Apple in there has more geometry than the entire rest of the kitchen uh it happens all the time I mean sometimes we get heavy heavy models that that kind of thing Entourage but that's not what I'm talking about I want to talk a little bit more specifically about the amount of detail you need in specific parts so I'm not picking on Tyson Tyson a couple last week or two did a couple of videos on modeling threads for 3D printing and it was awesome he modeled Nut and Bolt that could be 3D printed that would connect together and it's a process doing the the Whirl and the the material it it's it's really cool when you get it it looks good uh if you're printing it it's important that it be accurate so it works together um but I'm going to say that in a lot of models even models where we're showing how something is assembled with a nut and a bolt or a screw that ends up being extra information that you don't really need and we're going to talk about how you can get away without it right now all right so again no disrespect to Tyson or his amazing uh nut and bolt that he created but uh let's let's take a look at this now if the thing you're doing is showing a nut and a bolt and how they work together then yeah this level of detail so you can see I'm just just backing out the nut so you can see inside there I got the the threads in there the threads all the way up uh this thing this makes sense right cuz this is this is if this is the hero this is the thing I'm showing then it makes sense to have this level of detail if I was doing something like this where I was showing a cutaway of how a bolt Works inside of a nut and then I want to make sure I have my staggered my my angled pieces have all this line up yeah this is the perfect example of how to use SketchUp to illustrate something that you can't necessarily easily see this is perfect for this this is the hero of the model this should be SE seen this way but I mean let's just take a look if I double click into this one piece and I select it it's going to tell me that I have you know 2500 edges and faces in this just for this one little piece so if that's what the model is that's great if this is a 3D print for a practical part that's actually be used awesome go for it now I'm going to challenge that and say a lot of people use this have to get nuts and bolts into stuff that doesn't need this level of detail and this level of detail is going to end up weighing this thing down so I'm going to propose some Alternatives so here right here this is simple really simple this is like scary simple this is just a circle push pulled through the nut head and the bolt the bolt head and the nut shape and that's it so if I double click in here I select all this look at this less than a tenth of the geometry that's in this one over here and again depending what you're using for obviously if I was trying to illustrate how how the the threads of a bolt work through a nut this wouldn't work but if this little little thing was down here in the corner of a mechanical drawing or something like that more than enough detail right so uh we talk a lot about modeling the appropriate level of detail and this is an example of that this might work for a lot of cases and keep your model so much lighter again 1/10th that's that's a good saving but if you had 200 of these across a model then it would start to make sense it would start to make sense to have uh you know this this level of detail here so if that's not enough detail you could go something more like this so at this I have these kind of just undulating pattern in and out they don't turn so they're not actually threads they're not they don't follow a spiral down they are straight ahead but look look at this look at this when I select this 1297 so this is half the geometry that I have when I actually angle them like real threads and here's how that happens so so when I look at it here each side the 24 sided Circle each one's going to have a a plane that goes in out in out like that all the way down if we look over here at the actual the realistic one it's all broken in half right because because it has to follow this spiral pattern every one of those what's just a rectangle over here has to get broken into two different uh triangles so makes sense twice the geometry the other thing to think about is this nut right here so we look at this nut that's 10,000 over 10 I'm sorry over 1,000 additional faces if this bolt or this bolt goes through the nut then the nut doesn't actually need to have any unless I see this nut laying on the ground I need to see the threads inside having this be a solid face is going to be a huge saver of geometry I don't have to model those inside threads if they're never actually seen so something to consider there is don't model geometry that you don't have to see because even though it doesn't get drawn to the screen it's not necessarily going to going to slow down how quick your your you know your screen is moving it's still saved in so it has to load that geometry in every time you save or open the model all right so let's talk about practically applying this so right here I have this block with these four plates in here and they're all bolted in now some of these bolts have threads some of them are just rods some of them are just heads can you tell which are which let me cut you off no you can't you can't tell don't pretend don't fake it once it's all put in here all that matters is the head all that matters is that I'm telling it there's a thread right here or a head right here of a bolt and that's all that matters so when you get to this level and I I mention this specifically because I have actually seen models I've seen woodworking models with wood screws with the threads actually modeled put in so that all that was visible was the head and I mean hundreds of thousands of extra faces and edges in the model that didn't need to be there at all so if you're modeling something that's connected and flushed like this don't bother with more than the head and it was a trick actually they're all just they're just heads so I didn't actually have any they're all the same none of these actually have threads on there because because I'm modeling with purpose and not extra geometry so tricked you no moving on so now there are situations where you might want to add to that so this is a perfect example right here so maybe my construction drawing is or my assembly drawing is showing that this bolt it's called out is going to go into this hole through this plate it makes sense to put some geometry in here but again I'm going to challenge you right here this this is that that non angling uh non non real threaded no whls involved uh for the threads these are just concentric threads and you know what for an assembly drawing like this this is half the geometry of that other piece and it works just fine nobody's going to look at this and go oh that's not how my bolt looks it totally conveys information saves you half the geometry and works just as well as the next piece in line so again this was not intended to shame anybody especially Tyson thank you for the awesome video Tyson thumbs up uh this was just to keep at the top of your mind modeling for the level of detail you actually need now it's possible you're doing just a fun model that you want to do and and you're going to go through and your model to the nth degree super cool go for it do it do your thing that's fine if you want a performance model espe esally something when you start building things like this where they're they're repeat over and over and over bolt and bolt and bolt and screw and screw and screw that GE sooner or later going to add up and you may not have a performance hit but you're going to have a big model sitting in your hard drive that takes a long time to open or it is possible you'll have so many threads and so many pieces of geometry in there that it starts to do things like stutter when you when you rotate or something like that so think about it think about modeling the right level of detail and like I said this was just a couple of specific instances is of how you can save detail by modifying the geometry as you as you create it if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe more importantly they leave us a comment down below do you have some tricks for saving detail saving geometry in your models we'd love to hear them or if there's something specific you think we should show in one of our videos let us know that too we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
