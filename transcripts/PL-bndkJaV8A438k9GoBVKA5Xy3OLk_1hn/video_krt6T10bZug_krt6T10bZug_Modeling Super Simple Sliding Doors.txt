hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at modeling some sliding doors sliding doors bypass sliders I'm trying to think other names you know it's it's it's the situation where you have an opening and larger than normal opening usually like maybe a double sized opening and you have not one door slab but multiple door slabs that move past each other um this done with lots of doors like you can have I don't know I've seen doors with 10 panels that that open you know uh slide past each other we're just going to do two we're going to look at uh modeling a basic interior and exterior door we're do that right now okay so I have a couple of walls here this is going to be my interior the thinner shorter wall with a slightly smaller opening and over here we have a taller wider wall with a bigger opening so both these are grouped to begin with all right so um I'm going to model what uh something that I have in in my own house which is so here I have a let's see how tall how big is this this this opening is 410 so we're going to put uh a couple of doors in here I'm going to start from the center I'm going to draw a line right here and I'm going to come across if I come right to the center you have a 25 there but a 2ot five slab would not overlap with the next piece at all so we're going to go 2 and 1/2 foot so I'm going to go 2 fo 6 and I'm going to go straight up to the center of this I'm just hit my up Arrow key to lock that I'm going to bring it over here and I'm going to drop that down there we go and then that door is going to pull this way one inch all right so there's my that is my initial slab for this door I'm going to Triple click and I'm going to make this a component and just going to call interior door in this model simple enough all right now I'm going to take that and there's some depending on the amount of detail I put in here I could spend an entire session just talking about the rail and the the wheel that hangs down all that stuff to actually make this slide um I'm not going to do that I'm going to keep this fairly simple this going to look good uh in my model but that's about it um I'm going to come in here and I'm going to put in a little just a little handle kind of thing a place where I can just just pushed in maybe a half an inch or so so I could actually open this door uh I'm going to do that slightly below the center so I'm going to come over here at the center I'm drawing out of context right now that is intentional so I'm going to come over like like 2 in and then I'm going to drop down like I don't know 3 in and I'm going to come over just a you know a little something like that um you know what let's do this let's round the tops of these I'm trying to think of details I've seen on different doors so there I'm going to take a a shape like that and I'm just going to push it into the surface half an inch so I'm going to grab that command X I'm going to double click into the door paste in place that's going to put that in there and I'm just going to push it in like. five oops see how I got those little lines right there I can get rid of that by triple clicking or double clicking excuse me right click and then weld edges then when I push it in5 I don't get that uh those edges because the outline is welded all right so there there I have my slab I need two of those of course so I'm going to take this one I'm going to option copy it right here right now I'm I'm in line with that that's not going to work of course um it also has my my handles on the same side that's not going to work so one of the things I'm going to do I'm going to just bring this out here I'm going to scale I'm going to scale right around the middle like that and I'm just going to scale to minus one it's going to snap there there we go so now we have the same slab and this is important because if I come in here and I grab say this door handle and I move it around see both of them are going to move the same so I don't have to make just because it's opposite I can scale it inverted like that and that still works so I'm going to try and move this as simple as possible I'm going to line it up like that and then it needs to come in so I'm going to slide it over there we go I'm slide it right back click right there all right now they properly overlap now depending on the look and feel and how I mean they do make uh sliding Hardware that sits up into the top of the wall into the the casement um this could be done depending on the reality of the situation you might actually have a piece that hangs down and then the the hanging hardware is up here so maybe we again I'm just throwing out ideas here uh I might come out here like a couple inches and then maybe I have some kind of a something like this uh maybe I have a piece that sits like this just a piece of trim above something like that uh that might sit on there I might actually have a full casement I actually have pieces that go all the way around it really depends on the detail of your your the look and feel I guess I should say of your architectural model but there we go so pretty simple um we didn't put any smarts in this I didn't use Dynamic components or anything like that that's something else we could consider but there's a a quick and easy interior uh slider so on an exterior slider we're going to go a little bit further because we're going to have to create you know it's going to have this pocket that the whole thing's going to work inside of um so I'm going to I'm going to detail that out real quick so I'm going to say it looks something like this it's going to come out here it's going to come like this it's going to go this way uh that and then come in like this um yeah something like that I'm going to draw half of it then I will take this piece and just mirror that oops wrong piece mirror that right there all right so I'm going to take something like that this is I might the interior and exterior might be slightly different um but I'm going to take that and I am going to trace it around that so I'm going to take this is my path this square right here so I'm going to say follow me with this shape right here now obviously this isn't going to be perfect because I don't want that coming down Oops I did something wrong oh I cut that that's why that won't work because when I put this edge here it broke this so here's what I'm going to do easy enough fix I'm going to take that I'm going to slide it with a copy up get rid of this this get rid of that get rid of that that that that that that that that that all all the other that'ss go away then there's an extra edge here here and here there we go so now my my profile that I want to put around is on here so if I click this I got my profile or my my path I want to follow then I click my profile there we go now it goes all the way around there I can see that looks good I got a little Channel there um I can get rid of this face obviously the Bottom's not quite perfect because I'm not going to have trim down there so all I'm going to do in that case is just push pull that up flush dou click here and there we go got something like that for my exterior frame and then the next piece I mean well I should probably make this a group let's make that a group I don't have to make it a component it's not going to com well actually what I would probably do is get my doors in here and then grab the whole thing and make it component all right now depending on a lot of stuff right now comes down to how this is going to be built so again I'm going to draw my next slab not to the center but just past that so I'm going to say like 3 foot1 something like that and depending on your slider I might have one or two actual sliding doors so this one piece may actually be static um or it may move uh depends on on the thing so I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going to offset this and we're say this is a GL got glass in it or something like that so I'm going to come two Ines all right and then I'm just going to push it all the way through right now all right make a component at this point exterior door uh and then if I look at this uh actually I want to get a little bit more uh meat on this Frame it looks a little a little timid all right there we go something like that and then I might draw a rectangle right in the middle to represent glass again how much detail you want to go in here do you want to draw width in your glass that sort of thing that's up to you but uh that's good enough for me I'm going to just color that with a default glass material glass grab something thing here that's transparent I like this blue whoops I did the whole thing that's not going to work I'm go into context just the middle we go and then uh I can do then is see here's the other thing I could do again depending on if this is a single slide if this is not moving then I'm probably not going to put a a door handle on here but if I have something where both pieces can move past each other then I might actually want to come in here and put my Hardware in um I'm going to do the same thing I did before let's go ahead and just grab this option slide it over here and then we can grab this and shift slide that all the way back into that slot and there we go there they they lap over each other and then the last thing to consider here like I was saying would be the handle or Hardware how how does this how does one grab onto this and open it so I'm going to do something I'm going to make something up I know that sounds hard to believe but uh I'm going to come in here and I'm going to do something on the glass where maybe I have a uh a section of the door here I don't know something like this I'm going to pull this out like this a little bit so it actually sits out on the door maybe I'll round off these Corners double click to round off exactly the same on both something like that something like that then uh that back up and get rid of it and again here and I don't know maybe do something like this I'm I'm making stuff up but there's but however I get a handle on here or erase these edges because I could have again like I did with the other thing I could have welded that first and that would have prevented happen so I get a handle here that's the point is I got a handle here but you can see I had the same problem over here because what I didn't do with this is I did not scale it and invert it so let's do that real quick right now C right here 1 that almost worked that worked and has on the same side but because I would want this door on this handle on the other door i' have to scale this way as well about the middle to minus one there we go and obviously I'm learning it um so there we go so now I have a slider that I could oops I'd want to slide that along the axis want stay on the axis there but there we go now I have a sliding door that opens up the trim casement is all one piece at this point too I would probably grab all these pieces right click and make this a new component I can't talk while I type I don't know if you guys have that same issue but it's a it's a birth issue I've always had it create that okay and there we go now I have my slider component so I could take that use it multiple times across the the job or my model and I have my interior I didn't do the same thing here but I could do this I could grab these and make that into a new component [Music] interior bypass there we go two sliding doors in uh what was that about 12 13 minutes so I know I'm going to see comments about how people The Bu The bypasses or sliders they use look different than this or they never have this or the interior trim doesn't look like that or I yeah that's awesome cool you model yours and make it perfect the way that you need to see it for your job the way your Hardware Works go for it hopefully you see this and see the principles of the modeling are the important part how do we go about making the pieces how did we use the tools uh and that sort of thing and if you do make a cool bypass door and it's different from mine let me know about that too tell us about it put it up on 3D warehouse and show me how it's different where it's better how uh how you've dominated the sliding door modeling Biz and I'm an amateur I would love to hear that let's go do that uh if you haven't already click like down below let us know you enjoyed this video learn something from it and if you haven't subscribed you should do that too we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe but most important like I said leave us a comment down below do you get something out this video uh is this the way you do it do you do it differently do you have an idea that you think would make a good video on our Channel we like making these videos a lot like even more when they showing something you want to see thank you
