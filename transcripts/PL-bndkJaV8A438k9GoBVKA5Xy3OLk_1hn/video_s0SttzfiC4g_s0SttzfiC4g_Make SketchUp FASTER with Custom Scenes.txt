hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to talk about making Fast rendering working scenes in [Music] SketchUp so yeah we're in a bit of a uh a scene phase apparently talking about how we can use scenes to uh you know automate some of the things you do in SketchUp as your modeling so we talked about sections and and some other things this time I want to talk about uh you know what we would cost call a fast rendering scene so there's certain settings in SketchUp that take a little bit more time and a little more processor to put onto your screen and if you have a set of styles and viewport properties that don't use any of those you end up with a faster modeling session so we'll talk about what those are and we'll take a look at that right now all right so here we have uh not a fast and this this is not by no means is it slow this is a OKAY siiz model there's some Entourage there's quite a bit of geometry but it's not a huge model by any means um but you can see some of the stuff that we got going on in here uh so there's Shadows on the ground I have reflective materials I have an environment turned on uh I have profiles you can see my edges are a little bit thicker than the rest so again makes for a beautiful looking model but it can slow things down sometimes so in fact in this one of the things that we'll see is as I start to rotate like this uh I might I might get to a spot where my Shadows disappear and then pop back in or uh again this is small enough that I'm not having issues with components but you can see in bigger models uh I'll see a little bit of lag when I try to to move around or edit my model so and I should point out I'm in 20125 which is the most performing version of SketchUp ever so this is much better than it's ever been before but once I start getting a big model uh it can slow things down not just that but beautiful as this is the materials the Shadows all that sometimes that stuff can actually get in the way as I model you guys have seen me do live models you know that one of my the way that I like to model more than any other way is with white surfaces it just it's clean to me I can see the geometry there's no issues so I'm going to propose here a couple of scenes one which is my good-looking you know Beauty scene we'll call this beauty uh and then another scene which is going to take me into my kind of working uh setup so let's let's talk about that so let we'll take this one right now before we do anything else we're going to say okay this right now is my beauty scene I want I want to hold on to this I want this to be uh something I can jump back to so I'm going to go right now up to scenes and I'm going to create a new scene just like we've been doing in these recent videos I'm not going to leave everything turned on for scenes in fact I'm going to turn off most of it so I'm going to turn off turn off I'm going to turn off till I get down to style and fog I'm leave style and fog Shadow settings and environment settings on and turn everything else off and I'll go ahead and create that new scene this is an update to the style so I'm going to say go ahead and create that do it and I'm going to rename this we're going to we just called it Beauty we're going to stick with that this is my beauty scene so again because I didn't turn a bunch of these other things off I can jump to this scene which I mean there's only one so it's not jumping to much but you see it's rendering the scene from this only these properties so it doesn't matter where my camera is or anything like that um now that's awesome let's talk about what it takes to make a fast scene so I want to create a scene where drawing to the screen happens instantaneously nothing so you can see right there as I rotate see how my shadow disappears and comes back that's again it's just rewriting uh figuring based on where my model is how the Shadows Fall so it's it just takes a second but let's create a scene where that's not an issue let's get everything cleared out so we're going to just come down here uh let's start with Styles why not all right so first thing I was talking about was edges so edges are good I like seeing edges edges make editing easier but profiles can take just a half a beat to go through and figure out where profiles every time are supposed to be every time I move my model around every time I orbit so I'm going to turn profiles off so you can see there we go we got now all edges are the same size there's no thicker ones that are on on the sides and then let's go into our faces and I'm going to change the so again this is the way I would do it I don't I'm already here in the comments but the beautiful materials they are beautiful but I'm going to go ahead and drop this down to just white surfaces there we go so we still have transparency we still have you know I can still see everything in here but it's all white it's all just painted one material quick easy um in fact I may even again to make this as fast as possible I may come to my transparency and make that faster also that's going to just again make it the quickest possible style I'm also going to turn off as much as it pains me you guys know I love ambient occlusion I think it just it makes my models look so much better but I'm going to turn that off too everything I just want this clean as possible Style looking good um all right I'm going to go through here environments I'm going turn my environments off there's no interaction with the environments see my Skydome went away I just got this the plain SketchUp background looks good uh then the other thing I got in here is shadows I'm going to turn my Shadows off so now I have what I would call almost the cleanest easiest thing to work in the only problem with this view is cuz I turned profiles off so any geometry that's rounded over anything like that kind of disappears so this right here I don't like that um a way that I do model regularly is to come into view and turn on hidden geometry not objects but just geometry that's going to give me Dash lines in those spots where everything smoothed over where I would rely on a profile so this right here might be my quickest most performant way to work inside a SketchUp this is going to go fairly fast this is going to render quickly um I like this so I'm going to do this I'm going to do it I'm going to commit to it this is my modeling fast modeling scene so I'm going to go back up to scenes again with just style fog and Shadow settings turned on I'm going to hit Plus or create a new scene and this one I'm going to call modeling and now if I flip back and forth between these two you can see yes this is exactly what I wanted and I'm doing it from one view but obviously I could be in here I could be in here you know uh let's go let's go inside let's head in here and I could be working on this this desk right now maybe I'm I don't know moving around the information thing or something and uh let's see what does it look like in my beauty scene I can flip over give it just a second to apply all the stuff o yeah that looks nice but I want to make some more changes I'm going to hop back over to modeling and uh move my computers or whatever but this is the just it's just a super fast way to jump in again not everybody likes modeling with all this turned off this is like this is Cutthroat this is the most stuff turned off I could possibly turn off to make it as fast as possible there's probably somewhere in between you'll get a very very performant modeling session but this is going to get me the quickest quickest fastest renders to the screen uh most performance and I can hop to it with just a single click of the mouse so I don't know it was never intentional I didn't think oh scenes are so cool and they're underused and let's talk about a bunch of way to do different kinds of working scenes but that's what happened I think this is the last one I don't have any other ideas of things that can tie to scenes maybe you guys do maybe you can think of a spot that uh I didn't I didn't include in scenes but this was I think probably where we should have started having a working scene versus that beauty scene uh and being able to click back and forth between them um yeah I I think this is a worthwhile thing to have and something we talked about we didn't really talk about with scenes you can save those into your template too so you could actually have a default template that already has those scenes set up um whether they be these scenes or the section scenes or any of those other scenes we've talked about you could actually make that part of your template maybe that'll be the next video is how to set up a template with scenes keep the scene thing going um if that's what you guys want if you like this video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though do leave us a comment down below what do you think about these scenes is there a way to use scenes that I've skipped that you guys need to let me know about and would you like to see how to set up a template so that these scenes are already part of it let me know we like making these videos a lot we like them even more or when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
