hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about layering watermarks so I said a thing just now and then I jumped away what is layering watermarks um generally speaking watermarks are text or an image that you layer on top of your work it might be text it says like internal use only or uh you know not not to be shared or it might just be General data information or some data that you need to have on your work that goes out in SketchUp watermarks are like slides they can lay in front of or behind your current work so it can be like a great way to get a background in but it's also a good way to get uh imagery or something like that in front of the screen as well and we're going to take a look at how to do that right now so I'm going to work with this little cabin here um it's not a cabin it's it's a big look at this it's got to be like 12T tall it's not a cabin anymore it's it's become a a big house house but uh it's a nice it's a nice structure it's fairly simple I got it on some snow here as I'm recording this it's just a beginning of December and I want to make this look like a snowy mountain cabin uh so I could do this of course with SketchUp I could model I could geolocate this and then throw you know a bunch of mountains in the background and throw some pine trees up in here and you know I could model some snowflakes and put them between the camera and I could do all that stuff but uh it would take time it would take energy and it would make my model heavy uh with my water marks I can actually get the same effect and uh do it much quicker easier and keep my model nice and light and snappy so uh yeah I have this scene right here so it's just a simple got a little little model with some uh Shadows turned on and this is what I got this is what're going to work with so I'm going to come in here to Styles in Styles I'm going to click on edit and I'm going to come over to to the fourth tab which is the watermark Tab and that's going to give me a list of my watermarks now I don't have anything watermarks in here right now so we're just going to go ahead and put some in I'm going to start with just a background so I'm going to hit plus I'm going to go I got these on my desktop um I have this snowy background jpeg I'm going to go ahead and open that and it's going to come up on the screen and it's going to ask me name it because I'm going to have a series of water marks I am going to name this so I'm going to call this my background and I'm going to say this is not an overlay an overlay means in front of the model so you actually see this in uh the Styles panel right here I have model right now it's an overlay so that's in front of if I say background now it immediately drops below because it's behind my model so I'm going to keep it as a background I'm hit next I have the ability to say how transparent do I want this to be well I have no reason to maintain transparency to the background SketchUp so I'm just going to go say give me all image make it solid beautiful next uh what do we want to do you want to stretch it out do we want to tile it do we want to position it I nine times out of 10 I position it position gives me the most control where I want it to go it also lets me scale the whole thing so if I scoot this down here we can actually see I can scale how big this waterm Mark is going to be and I'm going to go big I'm going to drag it all the way as big as it can get and then I'm going to choose where I want to position it if I position it up higher it's going to snap the top it's gives me a whole lot of stars if snap it to the bottom then it moves my mountains up and I stars are nice but I'm trying to get an effect here of this background so I'm going to snap it to the bottom that's going to give me more mountain in the in the screen and then that's good I'm going to hit finish minimize this so we can kind of see what there we go so now I could I can move my uh my house around a little bit so it lays in there in the way that I want you know where what do what do I want to see as far as how close is it that kind of thing yeah that looks looks good got the background back there looks nice all right now let's get some stuff on top so let's let's put some things over top this is nice and clear but I want to make a snowy night so I could keep it like this and just throw some snowflakes in front but let's let's get some Haze in here so Haze could be done with fog the problem with fog is fog will really mess with water marks so as I soon as I throw fog on I'll get this uniform kind of blanking out of my background so I don't want to use fog to create Haze instead I'm going to use another watermark come back into Styles I'm going to hit plus again and I have a couple of these hazy uh transparent uh files pgs that I have loaded in here I'm going to grab this one that's called Haze top I'm going to bring that in and see that see what it does it kind of just gives me that Haze over the top so I'm going to call this uh I'm going to call it Haze top you can't stop me I'm doing it Haze top I do want to be an overlay I'm gonna say next um I could I that's pretty so at 100% that's pretty snowy that's you know that's almost fog that's that almost I can't see the background so I might actually dial that back a little bit maybe two-thirds the way like that that looks good say next and uh I'm going again I'm going to position it at the top of the window and make it 100% stretch all the way across my screen that's exactly what I want just a little bit of haze there um that looks good I like it and then I might come in here and I have it as a separate piece but I have a haze on the bottom too that I could bring in um I'll call it same thing I call it Haze bottom uh it's be an overlay I'm going to I'll go about the same you know like 2/3 of the way actually no you know what it's it's at the bottom it's over snow I'm going to crank it all the way up and I'm going to position it at the bottom and we're stretch it all the way across all right so it's subtle but I can see see how it's it's my lines right here kind of fading off to White a little more just gives me a little bit more of that ha effect um if I move my model around too so if I was to drop my you know come in closer like this I'd get some of it coming up under the bottom like that that looks good I like it um I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to go to view real quick and turn my axes off I don't like these the Blue Line sticking right there okay yeah see it's coming together I like how this is working out so I have this picture in the background some Haze in the front and let's let's just keep going I'm going to go I have this falling snow PNG so it note something to note I have these saved as pgs because pgs will maintain the transparency so like with that fog I didn't just get a white block all over everything I got that gradient so same thing is going to work with falling snow when I open that I'm going to see these snowflakes coming down but you see it it maintains a transparency there so we're going to call this one snow again an overlay and uh because it's just white I don't really want I don't want like transparent flakes like that you could do that but I'm going to Go 100% yes and uh let's just go ahead and tile that no that doesn't look good that's not it's not a seamless texture you can see that there's a break right there that's ridiculous why stray from what I know Works let's put a position put it in the middle make it as big as I can get oh yeah just like that so I can hear some people asking why didn't I just have my haze Haze and snow why wasn't that just all one absolutely you could do that but one of the things by having them separate I could come in here and I could come into my haze top and I could say let's you know let's dial that back even a little more let's make it a little bit clearer night and I can control that separately my snowflakes don't fade out when I do that because I have it as separate pieces likewise if I wanted to you know swap it out uh maybe I want to have a different background that I want to put in here I could do that quickly and easily by having that in there separate so having these SE separate pieces uh just gives me more control on how I want that to be displayed um yeah and you see that let's let's close some stuff up so we can just kind of silently celebrate this Majesty of I don't know I don't have more words to say there but it looks nice it looks good so obviously there's more work I could do I could turn some I have some Lin hard lines showing up here I could soften but you can see quickly and easily I talked a lot so it wasn't as quick as it could have been but you have a lot lot of control over how that's displayed and you can turn those on and get a picture like that no rendering no nothing and I'm still this is still a working model so I come in here and I could do whatever work I want while this is all here or if I wanted to I could at any point come into Styles and just temporarily hide them that'll get me back to just my working model and then I can turn back on whenever I want to visualize that with the watermarks so I hope you got something out of that um it is a fun and it is a quick and an easy way to go in and you know create that you can and these these assets could be created by you you could go into Photoshop or something like that and make some snowflake shapes and scatter them around uh or I mean nowadays it's pretty easy to find and download a lot of these files so uh everything I here got here I Googled for and uh you know if you're part if you have a a subscription service to any stock image or anything like that there's great stuff out there that you don't even have to work on so but it's your call if you're a designer and you like that kind of stuff go for it make some make some make some images and bring them in SketchUp uh but it does let you real quick and easily get that depth look at that look like this could be a Christmas card photo right here uh hope you like that if you did like that click like down below and if you don't already please do subscribe we create several videos and do a live model every week around here you be notified of all that if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you done this with watermarks you have a better way a quicker way to get this kind of look uh let us know in the comments we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they showing something you want to see thank [Music] you
