hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at adding animated sections to your model so what's an animated section that's when you take something like well you're going to take your 3D model and kind of move through it and cut through it like one slice at a time and see the insides all the way through that's like taking a camera and just kind of pushing it through going through walls everything just seeing all of it and this can I mean a normal section is something we just have a normal tool for you go and you put a section it cuts the model off and you look inside it from there but an animated section actually takes that plane and moves it through the model as you transition from one scene to the next it seems like it could be daunting but it's actually incredibly easy and we'll take a look at how to do it right now all right so I have a model I intentionally went and grabbed a model from the three Warehouse that was a longer model right so this would be fun to add a section through here so a couple things we're going to use to do this this uh this animation so we're going to use our scenes over here I'm going to look I'm going to open up scenes and we're going to use this section tool tools intersection section is under Tools and then right down here I have section plane so I'm going to use section plane and scenes that's it this is going to be very very very simple um so what we're going to start with is we're going to come in and we're going to put a section where we want to put the first cut so I'm going to start that on the outside over here I'm going to go to tools let me go to section plane and I'm just going to let that just going to snap it right right to the side with green boom like that I'm going to call this start we'll start with a little one there all right so that's number one so now before I do anything else what I'm going to do I can right click on this make sure it's active yes this is what I want this is active and I'm going to come over here and I'm going to say create a new scene but before I click the plus button hopefully if you're following along you were slow and didn't do it already I'm going to come down here to what I want to include so I have the option right here to choose what I want to include with this all I want to see in this in this scene I'm about to create is where the section is at so I'm going to turn everything except for active section Plane off all of it's turned off only include an animation turned on so turn all the rest of them off and I'm going to hit Plus and that creates my first scene that's good you call it scene one that's cool I don't care now I'm going to create another section plane so I'm going to come over here I'm going to kind of come right here I'll take it all the way out to the end of this deck here so we'll go to tools again section plane again um I might be able to snap to the end now I'm just going to hit the left Arrow key to lock it to green and then just click right here I'm going to call this end okay now a couple things are happening here right now we have two section planes only one section plane can be active at a time and right now it should be number two it is it's the active cut it's also facing the wrong way right it's cutting this direction I want it to actually cut the other direction so I'm going to right click on it I'm gonna say reverse and everything's gonna disappear but that's okay so you can see here's what's going to happen well let me let me back up let's go ahead and say this in a scene before I do anything else so I'm just going to come over here active section plane is still the only thing turned on I'm just going to hit Plus I got Scene two so scene one this is active scene two this is active what's going to happen now is as I transition from one scene to the next SketchUp is going to animate one section plane to the other so if I come to scene one I click all I'm going to do is click on scene one it's going to run back look at this it's going to run back through the whole model until it gets back to where that first section plane was placed oh yeah that's the stuff that was cool now because we didn't save anything like camera location like that I can come in here and figure out where do I want to look at this from let's try this let's hit scene two yeah look at that cuts through that's pretty cool I like that let's get let's get to the point where I'm like just staring right down I just want to see this this thing just get built right in my face let's try this here it comes also a 3D movie so you can see each of the pieces getting built very cool very simple animation now this is taking you know a few seconds to animate that's all part of my my settings right so if I come in here to view animation and I go to settings I currently have this set at 10 seconds uh let's just for the sake of brevity let's drop this down and say like we're going to see that as five seconds instead and then you can hit this button yeah look at it go through there that's awesome very cool one of the things I don't care before in this though is that my section planes show through the whole thing right so here I can see them I don't like that very much so I want to go ahead and get rid of them so I'm going to go ahead and just grab both of them right now I'm going to right click on them and just hide them and this one's highlighted oh it's because it's active um now if I hit play oh yeah look at that you'll notice I didn't have to go back in and update the scene with the hidden sections because the state of the visibility of those sections wasn't saved because the only thing that was saved was the section plane so very nice way easy way to uh you know save yourself some work later on like this and then hit that again I love it look at it look at oh beautiful I feel like getting built better than I like it disappearing though I think this is cool how it comes out uh I could see this as an animation for a product this container on as a product or something like that um it is a little quick though so I might actually come in here to animation and hit settings open that up to like I don't know 10 felt like it was dragging let's see if eight feels better yeah I think that's it uh very cool so that's it I don't know if you guys are counting but the actual process of adding the scene or adding the sections and then adding the scenes the whole thing takes about three or four minutes it is very simple very easy to do uh again I would recommend any time you're working with scenes be conscious of what information you're actually saving with the scene this this will bite you all the time I mean it gets me constantly where I just I'll just save everything but I didn't need everything I only needed one or two things so if you're conscious of that it's going to save you some pain like like that like hiding hiding my two section planes I just did it and I didn't have to update anything so there we go that's all it takes a couple of clicks a couple session planes couple scenes and you can have this very cool building or unbuilding animation created in SketchUp so hopefully you like that if you haven't seen that before like I said when you see that animation oh that's cool how that happened very easy very simple to do a couple of clicks and you can have it in your own model if you like that video go ahead and click like down below maybe share this with somebody uh maybe leave us a comment have you ever done this before do you use section planes or animations at all how to use them are they different from what we just did love to hear what you're thinking if you don't already you should probably subscribe if you made it this far in this video it means you have some appetite for SketchUp and we aim to serve you as much tasty SketchUp as we possibly can all right we'll see you next time thank you [Music]
