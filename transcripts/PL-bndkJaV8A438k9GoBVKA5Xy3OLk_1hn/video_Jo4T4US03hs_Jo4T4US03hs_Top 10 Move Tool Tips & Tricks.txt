hey guys I'm Aaron and today I have for you 10 my top 10 tips and tricks for the move command I know that seems like a lot right move seems pretty simple you click move you click this thing and you click where you want to go yeah it is it is that simple but there's a lot more that it can do and we're talk about all those things well at least 10 of those things right now all right first things first uh move command is up here under Tools you click here to go to move um it's also on the toolbar uh I have it on the default toolbar it's part of large tool set um but I'm going to tell you right now the way to do that to get into to move is to use a shortcut key the default shortcut key is the m key it's great it's right above the space bar it's easy to hit uh it you know it's kind of stands out in the crowd it's got two Pokey it's pointing up that's kind of nice so yeah M's an easy one to get to that is the shortcut key of course if you want to change the shortcut key you can go to preferences short cuts and assign a different key to it but as m is probably one of the more used modification tools I would recommend using a shortcut key that you are you know you're going to want to smack a lot this this is a a a key that you're going to want to use a bunch um all right so here is something that we can do with move so if you're in move and nothing is selected when you move over something it will automatically highlight so if I move over this group right here it highlights and then I can click to start my move if I hit Escape everything's UNH highlighted and I go to the next thing I want to move and move it um this works different from pre-select we'll talk about pre-selecting items in a moment but without anything selected move will automatically select something based on where you click when you click so it's a little bit different from other commands because uh there you can use it totally with nothing selected and which will let you just come in here grab something move it and then you're back out of the command again now you're ready to select something new select move it click to place it and you're back out and ready to select something new so it's kind of nice if you have a bunch of things to move or you have things you want to move to multiple locations you can without selecting anything just move over the thing one item at a time the other thing that you can do when you have nothing selected is you can not just move things surfaces edges but you can actually move points so I can actually move over this point right here click on it and now I'm moving that point around away from the rest of the model this can only be done if you go into move with nothing selected so to do that of course if I come in here uh if you tap the the Escape key once you'll make sure nothing is highlighted if you're burrowed down deep into multiple components or groups or something like that you might have to tap Escape multiple times but Escape will deselect everything and then you can pick any point you just hover over the point and when it's highlighted click and release and now you're moving when you find the spot you want it to go click and release and it will place it there I'm going to undo that cuz I didn't like that speaking of moving or distorting geometry so when I grab that point you can see all the other all the other edges connected to that point moved along with my mouse I I made a mess of this uh this block that I got right here I can do the same thing with edges so normally if I move over an edge and I click I start dragging it I'm going to be constrained usually on one of the axes uh which is going to limit how I can move so that I don't overly distort the geometry so right now I did I did not hit an arrow key to constrain my movements I'm just just moving my my cursor in a circle you see it's only moving back and forth that is because something called autofold we have it down here in the toolbar see I'm on Mac so it says the modifier key for me is command equals toggle autofold autofold is turned off right now so it's not going to let me fold up or change the geometry if I do tap that modifier key now I can move in any direction and distort this geometry however I want you can see as I move it over this way it does cause that front front face to break so I have two faces there instead of one I come back here slide this way so you can see that's what autof full does if autof folds turn on I can move this anywhere I want if autof fold is is not turned on then I am limited to movements that don't break the connected faces great tip to have if you know that it's going to happen Okay um I'm going to go ahead and I guess some loose geometry I'm going to make this a group and I'll just make this a group maybe we'll explode them later but uh I mentioned coming into move which is the m key hop in there real quick and easy lets me hover over anything and move it but there are some cases where you want to move more than one thing or uh maybe you want to pick a thing first and then hit the move key um that's going to let you pick your from and to point uh the other thing I can do if I pre-select is I can select multiple things so I select all these bricks and then hit move and now I am moving all three of them in one go that can only be done if you select before you hit the move key again if I hit move key if I hit move before anything selected now I'm in the click to select mode I can only pick one but that is an option too all right the other thing I can do is when I do move so I'm going to just pick this one block and I'm going to go into move when I go to move I can hover over the corners of this container so this this what I'm showing right now is only relative to groups or components because they're the only things that have these containers um and if I go onto like a corner right here I could actually grab it and move it from there to align that with another piece of geometry or something like that if I want these two to butt up against each other I could grab that and move it right here um if I want want to change I can actually hit there's a if I watch the bottom right here if I hover over my selected group I have an option lists a modifier key and says click this to cycle through grip types so if I hit that modifier key I will change so that went from showing me the corner points to now showing me the midpoints of all the edges see that if I hit it again it'll show me the middle points of all the sides hit it again one more time and now I get there we go the middle point of the entire volume so just tapping that modifier key each time is going to give me a different set of points that I can move from so a nice option like I said you do have to actually have what you have to have highlighted is a thing that is in a container so it does have to be in a group or uh a component for this to work but then you can actually choose where you want to move it from and get a point at each of those spots speaking of moving I don't have to grab a any geometry connected to the thing I'm moving actually so if I select this this brick right here I go into move and I click on this point as my from point and this point as my two point it will move that piece of geometry relative to those two points a lot of people I'm going to undo think that when when you go to move you do have to grab a point that is on here that's not necessarily true and there's some cases based on Geometry if you have real complicated geometry working in a in a big builtup model you might not really be able to easily select the point you want to move but you can always use reference geometry to move things the point you move from or the point you move to doesn't have to be in any way connected to the selected geometry speaking of moving uh this tip should go without saying but doesn't always uh arrow keys to lock so if I want to move along this red axis but I'm having a hard time keeping my cursor directly on that dotted red line I can always hit the right arrow and that's going to lock the red axis in and now I can do things like if I want this to line up with this piece I can click right here and then that will have moved along the red axis parallel to where it was originally arrow keys are huge don't forget them sometimes it is easy to forget that you do that get irritated I can't snap to the point I want to I can't move where I want to you forget the basics like using your arrow keys all right uh the other one this is simple but uh move is also copy so if again if you look down at the bottom we have this thing right here there's a modifier key for copy stamp and I'm if I tap that key whatever that modifier key is if I tap it once I'll get a little plus sign next to my move cursor and then I can grab geometry and then when I click it will put a new copy in that location the other thing I can do is I can tap that button twice if I tap it twice then I go into stamp mode and stamp mode says okay pick my from command my from location and every time I click again I'm going to create new geometry and the cool thing is something to think about here I can combine some of this stuff too because I can come in here I go to move put turn on my stamp and and rather than clicking where I want to start from I could use something like my my relative copy again or my relative move I click this point and say between this point this point Place one there Place one here Place one here I don't actually have to connect connect to any geometry to move with copy or stamp just like I don't have to when I'm moving that was 10 I was counting that was 10 things and I know some of those okay you probably maybe already knew about copy uh but uh maybe you use the arrow keys all the time every time you move no question about it but uh I would love to hear if there's anything in there that slipped your mind you forgot about or you didn't even know about it would be cool to hear that if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though do leave us a comment down below like I was saying if there's something specific in this video you want to call out or if I miss something is there an 11th thing about the move command that I totally didn't catch tell me about that down in the comments as well or if you have an idea if there's another command inside of SketchUp that you're like I need to go deep with this tell me everything that just to know about this let me know maybe we'll try to whip together a tips and tricks video for that command or if you have something totally different something totally outside the box that you think would make a good video for us let us know that too write down those comments we read them cuz we like making videos but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
