hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look what makes a good and not so good photo for match photo so we've done a handful of videos that show match photo and how to how that works how to import a file how to line up the lines and everything I'll link to a couple of them down in the comments or the description excuse me when I get this posted but what I really wanted to do was spend a little bit of time looking at some some images that I created some some pictures I took and which ones are good and which ones are not good and how you should go about taking a picture if you want to use it for match photo let's take a look at how that works right now all right so I'm going to import a couple different images uh I'm gonna just just to keep the Slate clean I'm going to start a new model for every import just to show you guys how how it works we're not going to go into actually importing and modeling so much they said I'll link to the files down below or some some videos below that show that process what I want to do is just look at a couple of images and why some of them work and some of them don't so I'm going to go to file import and I'm going to look at the files I have here I took a bunch of pictures and I wanted to look at what does make good so I have this one called ideal that's we're going to end with ideal we're going to go out on a good note we're going to start with this one called bad one and we'll see why I have that so I'm going to go ahead and select it I'm going to make sure I have use as match photo turned on I'm going to import it all right some of you are looking this and going yeah that's not going to work but you would be surprised how many people have images like this wanting to know why match photo doesn't work for this so match Photo Works if you look at these lines see how these lines are disappearing towards the back match Photo Works by taking the vanishing points and the change of geometry to match your modeling space to this geometry this doesn't have Vanishing points we're looking straight at this picture would be great if I wanted to apply it to a model to make it look like this building but for match photo I have to see two sides and I have to see Vanishing points so this is terrible this is not what you want to have when you look at match photo you definitely want to be seeing something from the side and I want to point out I'm using this I've used this building before it's just a building utility shed that's near where I live it's nice for match photo because it gets rid of slopes and it only has straight lines and very clear-cut easy to see lines um match photo of course works with far more complex building but this is a very clear illustration of how maxed photos should be working so this model it doesn't matter I could move this over to this line I could align my green lines to one side of this building but I can't go any further than that because I can't see the other side so no matter what I do at best I have a surface this won't work for match photo all right let's start a new one and we'll file new you can also just I don't know if everybody knows this but you can start a new match photo from the match photo window by hitting little plus right here same dialogue same thing comes up but let's uh let's grab the next one go ahead and click open all right some of you are looking at this and going I know what's wrong here so the issue here is uh I took several of these pictures with just my iPhone and my iPhone has two separate lenses on it one is the standard which is what uh the good spoiler alert that's what the good picture is taken with and one of them is a kind of a fisheye a more wide angle so as you look at this you can almost see see how much more exaggerated this this front and back are than over here so it kind of kind of I almost have this swoop that comes up depending on the severity of that swoop depending on how exaggerated the fisheye has made it so you can see here this is not the worst but you can kind of see how this this concrete dips down just a little bit below the straight line this is going to be it it's not going to this like I said it's not super exaggerated in this example but I can see same same thing there you can see see the the blue coming through between where my line is and where that concrete is that means that this one is just it won't work out this will I'll get I can get probably get close enough since it's not terribly exaggerated but this fisheye this exaggerated uh Zoom is going to cause issues and I'm not going to get a perfect alignment between geometry and the image I'll have these little little gaps this this won't line up perfectly so you want to make sure that when you're using a lens it's not distorting like this it's an issue with lenses on like small shallow lenses like you see on a phone because it doesn't have the big depth between one lens to the next they're very shallow so it's easier to kind of just have a wide lens to get more in it can cause a little bit of an issue so if you see an image like this just be conscious that you might be able to make it work but it's not the ideal image for match photo keep going uh one of the questions that always comes up whenever we talk about imagery is what about Drone footage well let's look at some Drone footage all right so one of the nice things about drones of course is when you get Drone footage you get to see the roof right a lot of the images we take from the ground mean we're looking up at the roof so depending Drone footage actually ends up being no different from standard footage in a lot of ways primarily in that if you're using a camera that is not going to cause distortion Drone footage can be awesome depending on the lens if I use use a lens that you know that does squish stuff down it can cause a little more of an issue we can see what this drone foot is looking at from above this works pretty well now there are limitations right because because it is taken from a drone because oh look at the little shadow of the Drone because it's from above and looking down I don't get to see stuff like it's harder for me to see like where the door is I can't actually see the underside of this overhang so I'm guessing a little bit but overall Drone footage can be very very useful and can actually make a good match photo if the lens you're taking from is not distorting anything it's keeping everything fairly clean um and it's taken from the right angle this was a directly overhead image it might be a great reference image for a sloped roof right if I was looking straight down on my house I wanted to match the roof great reference photo but not necessarily good match photo this one however turned out pretty good all right let's look at something that's not so good start one another new one and I'm going to import the worst possible scenario maybe not the worst I'm sure there's there's worse than this but uh yeah this is definitely not a good one and we see it a lot so right away when you look at this uh people who are used to 3D modeling will look at this and go what there's definitely an issue here so what happened with this is this was sort of an attempt to use photo editing to create an isometric view so in this case my my lines here here here are pretty close to equal which means the vanishing that photo match relies on isn't going to work so this this kind of thing this is an exaggerated view I mean on this little tiny building I don't know why anybody would go in and do something stupid like this other other than myself uh but I only do it to prove a point um this happens all the time with larger buildings people take pictures of like skyscrapers tall buildings and when you take a picture from a a sky you know multi-story building a 20 30 story building from below and you look up it it's going to taper upwards so what people will do is they'll use photo editing software to make the sides of the building rather than go towards each other be perfectly straight which kind of pulls them out distorts the geometry looks good in an image of a building but you can see what happens when I bring in here to photo match if I try to align it look at look at this should be vertical that's not even close to Vertical because I've I've distorted the geometry as much as I have so I see this a lot uh when like pulling stock photos of Glamor Shots of buildings which makes sense because you know most people who are taking a photo of a famous building and Publishing it aren't doing it so you can get a good match photo set up in SketchUp I know how rude they're doing it so the the building itself looks good in the picture so it happens a lot and unfortunately it does kind of ruin the ability to use that photo as a match photo see yeah see how this is this is not the way stuff should look all right so let's do one last image here and this is the how to do it right so I'm going to go ahead and import again and I'm going to use this one right here all right so this photo was taken from pretty close to ground so a few feet up from ground level uh it was taken the center of the photo pretty close to the middle is this Edge coming towards me this is taken with a lens that does not distort the geometry hardly at all and you can see almost immediately as I'm starting to line this up you can see the vanishing points right so you see how that corner that's near me is much taller this line right here is way bigger than what I have on either side that's the vanishing I'm talking about that's what is super important for match photo that's basically how match photo functions is those Vanishing lights you can actually see as I'm putting dragging my my uh points around and you can see how it's setting up my grid to match and align and look at that when I get my when I get my Green Point my second Green Point in there you can see how that lines up and this vertical line shows up perfectly you can scale it so it's about the right size this is how a photo should be taken so again not on one side not at an exaggerated uh you know wide angle lens not necessarily high up from above this makes the perfect photo for match photo don't you love when content creators spend the whole time showing you how not to do something and then right at the end they're like and then do it right um there's a point for that you know I I guess I don't know this is the way it worked out hopefully that helps if you've ever had a photo come in and you've tried to use match photo and it hasn't worked uh I would be interested to hear if these were the things you ran into or if there was something else let me know if I missed anything if there's any type of photo or type of setup for a picture that causes match photo to not work I would love to hear that tell me in the comments down below uh and if you haven't already please do like subscribe and maybe even suggest this to somebody else um if you have an idea for a video like this let us know about that in the comments too we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
