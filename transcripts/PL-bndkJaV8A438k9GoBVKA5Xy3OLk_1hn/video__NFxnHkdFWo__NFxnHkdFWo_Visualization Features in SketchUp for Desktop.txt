hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at some amazing visualization features in SketchUp 2025 so I don't want to overuse this term but I think it's safe to say that SketchUp 2025 allows you to make the best looking SketchUp models you've ever made um there's always been Tools in there to get like import custom materials and and put those on there but but there's some stuff in SketchUp 2025 that is just beyond anything you've been able to do with SketchUp before um I'm not talking about using rendering engines those are awesome rendering engines are amazing and let you get to that that photo reel thing at the end that's great but SketchUp 2025 visualization allows you to create models and work on them and have them just literally the best looking ever uh so we're going to take a look at how that works in SketchUp for desktop and we're going to hop in right now okay so I have a model here and this is SketchUp we are we are inside SketchUp no uh no rendering no post workor at all and you can see some stuff Happening Here you see uh for one thing like like look at this look at this face right here on this model as I move this around see how that light changes on it how it reflects that is not like a just a a goodlook reflective texture that is actually light playing off of the properties of a material um that's cool that's awesome and let's let's talk a little bit about why and what that all is so the first thing to notice is that this is all SketchUp you can see see the colors changing as I move around uh at the same time if I if I come in here I'm going to double click a couple times to get into this thing right here you can see that this right here is just a SketchUp surface so here here I'm actually push pulling uh let's uh let's go let's let's Push Pull so makes a more sense make this a little bit taller so I drag that up and down and you can see that that's that is exactly what this is just SketchUp no post no rendering no nothing like that this is just goodlook materials and lighting happening right inside SketchUp actively uh let's talk about what this exactly means so SketchUp 2025 has a different way of vising visualizing models than ever before so if I come over here in Styles a couple things to mention uh if I click here to edit my style one of the things that's in here of course is ambient occlusion ambient occlusion was actually in here in the last release but uh ambient occlusion is a part of why these models look so good so when we look down here we see this little little bit of Shadow between these two surfaces as they meet little teeny Shadow here underneath this person this is all ambient occlusion right this is those uh uded Shadows that happen anytime two surfaces come together it's what happens in the real world uh that sort of thing and that is part of what makes this model look as good as it does the other thing that makes it look as good as it does is the materials I'm going to go ahead and hit my paint bucket tool and pull up my colors window now I'm on Mac so if you are on Windows this is going to look a little bit different but the same information is being portray here so as I look at some of these materials you can see I called this out earlier this this shiny black material here as we move it see how that it reflects on there um the light plays across these different materials so we look down here we've got this grass got this kind of sunset light happening right now where it's bringing in this warmth and this uh this you know deeply angled light this is all part of the 2025 uh visualization so let's talk a little bit about these these new materials that we can put in here uh I'm going to go ahead and leave the colors and model there's a bunch in this model let's go hop in here let's let's look at a brick material I like brick uh brick is cool looking probably because I grew up and still live in Suburbia and I just don't have enough brick in my life I have to get it and sketch up um so let's grab this we have this context model over here it's kind of this uh semi see-through material but if I click in here a couple times we can get in and we can here's this main face um I want to put a couple materials on here so I'm going to do this I'm going to grab a edge and draw that straight down here and there we go break that into two separate pieces all right and I will grab a brick material I'm just going to grab this one here on the end put that right there and we can zoom in here this is a Hu this is a huge this is that's like four or five stories tall of just just straight brick but there we go you can see that look at that brick it looks good and as I again as I go like this look at how how the the light changes across the face it's not as Extreme as that black piece was that black piece was supposed to be like a I don't know a painted metal surface you can see it's not not as extreme cuz it's not shiny but you can see how the light changes as I flick back and forth right here and this is again actively on this just a surface and SketchUp um that works because let's here let's go home and let's uh I'm going to double click on this material and bring up the properties of this material so this is the big this is a big change that happened inside of SketchUp 2025 on how we show materials is rather than just having an image or a color or something like that SketchUp now has this additional properties in here so we have these four checkboxes metalness roughness normals and ambient occlusion so this one doesn't have a metalness the metalness is like that straight up shininess the reflectiveness that that was on that other piece of material if I was to turn this on we'd get much more shine on here than uh than we would actually want on a brick so you can kind of see how that look at how it kind of like if we came and put some clear coat over the bricks is what that's going to look like the roughness uh I can actually slide this up and down you'll see how that changes too roughness and metalness are almost at odds with each other yet control two slightly different values but I can see here as I drop my roughness down it gets a little bit shinier uh whereas something like a brick wall is going to that's kind of the epitome of full rough so we also have normals in here if I crank this up I'll get what I would call two normal I I don't know this is overly normal um but no that's just pulling up those those surfaces so you can see see how the light is reflecting it's coming here in here uh on these pieces between the brick and by sliding that normal up I'm getting more light catching there than I necessarily want but I can change that normal and then of course Aman occlusion is that those Shadows that happen in inside the texture between the faces and I can actually increase or decrease that as well to get you know less ambient occlusion um you guys know how I feel about ambient occlusion though where am how am I going to go anything less than one on ambient occlusion so this material uh as we put it in there reacts then with the light that I have in the model so if I look at another material real quick let's just let's just uh let's grab something that's full shine let's go some get some metal let's go grab some metal and I'm just going to throw this highly reflective material oops I'm going to get back in here uh and there we go put that on that material that material on there and you can see there with this that's just that material is fully let's I don't even know let's just go check I'm assuming that's 100% metalness yeah look at that and uh you can see not only is the light changing but because it's so reflective we're actually getting a reflection of the Skydome back there as we move around speaking of Skydome transition yep segue let's go so another piece of this visualization is what we're seeing all around not just that light I was talking about the light the light is great it's great that it's it's showing light it's lighting things up but you see we also have this image all the way around this image all the way around that that's where the lighting is coming from if I come over here to this new panel called environments you can see what we got in here we got down at the bot we have the our current environment and at the bottom we have a handful of other environments we could switch to so I could switch between these two or the these I think there's 18 in here to start with and that's going to do a couple things not only is it going to change the image in the back but it's actually going to change the lighting values so if I switch to so rather this uh Sunrise sky right here I'm going to switch to this one which is at C you can see not only did the background change but that lighting changed considerably that warm deep reflection reflective light that was coming in from the side that's gone instead we have this kind of cool cool that's that's the word to use cool lighting coming in all around uh so we can see as we switch these different things we're going to get different lights coming in from different spots and then we're also going to get a change of that Sky Dome if I click on edit right here there's some things I can actually change as well so uh I can change the rotation angle of that Skydome you can see not only does that switch that around what's behind me but it also changes the lighting as well we can also change the exposure both of the Skydome itself so you can fade that sky doome in and out and I can actually Reflections I can increase or decrease those as well so a lot of control over this but uh one of my favorite things to do in here is to check this little box right here set Sun location and you'll see what happens is here's the Skydome image right this is the the image of the whole thing here laid out flat you see there's a little sunlight location on here the sun location by default is where the sun is in the image but I have the ability to just grab that and start sliding it around and put it in different places and then I can see how that actually changes the reflection on my my model how that changes the lighting so pretty cool uh a neat way to go in and fine-tune how do you want so not just before you know we could we could say use sun is shading and then we could set the day in time and it would drop a shadow uh that kind of thing this gives us a just a new level of control over how we visualize and I want to drop one more show you guys one more thing here that I think is super cool uh I'm going to drop right down in here I got this little box just kind of sitting out front I'm going to put a new material on here so I'm going to say file I'm going to go to import and out here on my desktop I have this tile material I'm going to import that as a texture this isn't new this is this is old stuff right so I'm going to grab that and I'm start pulling across like that and uh there we go it tiles it this should look familiar because what I just did is just standard stuff I imported that you see I didn't that material was not seamless so I have this obvious seam right across here um not beautiful looking not bad but uh not great so it did come in as material with reflectivity so you can see I have metalness on there I'm seeing the light shine on here that's awesome that happened automatically but you can see it it looks like a vinyl sticker is on this thing right it's one flat piece there's no normals there's no uh ambient occlusion there's no it's not honoring the fact that I have grout here versus tile none of that's happening fortunately it's almost as if I set that up intentionally to teach you something hey I did uh if I pick this material if I double click on there uh when this comes up I get this little generate texture magic pixie dust sprinkly icon and I'm just going to go ahead and click on it and let SketchUp 2025 use the power of AI to analyze this material figure out not just how to make it seamless because that's what it obviously needs they have these weird shaped tiles in here they should all be the same so I'm not only going to get a seamless texture right now but it's actually going to figure out what my roughness and normal Maps should look like as well so when it's done it's going to give me okay not only like I said there's my seamless but I can actually see when I look at it see how the the light plays differently off the grout than it does to the tile and that happens automatically and now that material is part of my model so if I come in here look at this go back go back to my my material in my model and I will see that there's that material and now I can use that just like any other material apply that it created used AI to create a brand new texture material there that I can apply anytime and have it behave just like any of the default materials that I've been using throughout the rest of my model so there you go there's a a quick shot a quick idea of how to use SketchUp 2025 to create the best looking SketchUp models you have ever created that wasn't meant to be disparaging I'm sure you've created some amazing looking mods in the past but I for one am excited to see see what you can do with these features how do you take your good-look models and make them look even better using new materials image based lighting and maybe even a little bit of AI I'd have nowhere to go I had nowhere to close that let's try that one last time that was not meant to be disparaging I'm sure you've created some amazing looking models in the past but think about what you could do with this new materials these these physical based materials this uh image based lighting and a little bit of AI I for one can't wait to see what your SketchUp modes look like now thank you [Music]
