hey y'all my name is Tyson and today let's just talk about how you can control the segments in your arcs and circles so recently I've been talking about level of detail in a in various ways and a lot of that comes down to controlling the number of sides or segments in your arcs and circles and poly and curves that sort of thing there's a couple ways to do it just wanted to do a refresher on how you can do it natively within SketchUp let's have a look so a quick reminder that indeed we look at this really large um all curves all arcs all all circles are made up of straight segments but you can control the number of segments for uh more or less detail depending on how big and small and and what your needs are and so we are just going to talk about the various ways to do this and the the way you can do this is going to be the same for circles arcs polygons that sort of thing now by default circles are going to have 24 sides but if I grab the circle tool or Arc tool and uh I've been messing around so I'm messing with my defaults the circle tool I can change that before I start drawing so as I switch to different tools The Arc tool the polygon tool the circle tool you can see the number of sides is changing the default if I type right now 60 and hit enter I will be drawing a 60- sided Circle but if I instead type five and hit enter you can see that circle's only going to be drawn with five sides um let's dial this back up to say 30 and start drawing now I've clicked I'm drawing my circle and if I type in a number it's going to be the radius of this circle so if I type 4 foot hit enter it's the radius if I type 80 uh that'll be 80 in however I can still change the number of segments by typing a number followed by s s for sides or segments so instead of 80 if I type 80s and hit enter you can see that Smooths out a lot because I've introduced a lot more sides but if I type 12s and hit enter now it's 12 sides now I can still change the radius if I type 120 that's 120 in hit enter now it's still the radius but if I hit 120s hit enter it's going to be sides now there's one more way that we can do this so again we can draw a circle or arcs we can change the number before we can change it while we're drawing so let me say 5T at 45 or 48 sides but if I click on this and we look in our entity info on the surface I'm given the area but if I carefully click on the edge or edges it shows me the segments so I can turn this up to let's say 60 or I could turn it down to 18 hit 18 hit enter so you have a lot of flexibility in uh creating um or altering the number of segments because again you can do it before you start drawing while you're drawing or after you're drawing now one note to be sure if I pull this up into a cylinder I can no longer change the segments of uh either of these right this is now connected to other geometry and uh it changing the number of segments at this point would mess up how that connection works so you can only do it while it is a flat 2D shape but just as another example let's quick draw some arcs and if I say uh Arc tool by default it's 12-sided but if I draw another Arc again I can change it beforehand so this time I'll just say8 hit enter and now eight is the default because I've changed it before or while I'm drawing but again I can change this afterwards and I can change this uh to 30 sides so now it's much smoother but if I come back to draw eight is still the default unless I change the tool before or while I'm drawing it so for this example I'll say 18 now 18 is the default if I restart SketchUp or start a new model it's only the default for this model but it is the default um for any other arcs I'm drawing uh at this point and again polygons are the same default number is six but I can type 12 now I have a 12 12-sided polygon uh or while I'm drawing this polygon I can change that to 8s hit enter and also change it after the fact and of course we can change the radius to 3 foot at back to six sides all right so that again that's sort of just covering some of the basics but hope hopefully um if you didn't know that you could again change the number of segments before your drawing while you're drawing and after you're drawing you do have a lot of control uh over your circles your arcs or polygons so use it learn to just jump in and out and change the number of segments frequently based on again whatever you're drawing in your needs so hopefully that was helpful let us know what else you'd like to see even basic tips like this um we'd love to have that conversation and we'd love to to help you improve uh whatever you're you're drawing with SketchUp thanks as always do like and subscribe we'll see you next [Music] time
