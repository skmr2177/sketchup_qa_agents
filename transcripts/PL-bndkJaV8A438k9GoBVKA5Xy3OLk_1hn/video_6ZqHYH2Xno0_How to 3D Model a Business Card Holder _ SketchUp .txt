Hey guys, it's Aaron, and today, we're going to model a business card holder. So I can already hear the comments, “I already have a business card holder.” “I don't use paper business cards.” “That's too simple.” The goal here is to give some good instructions on something that has to be modeled with some precision. And we'll actually talk about how to avoid exact precision, because there's some spots where we want a little bit of slop. The idea here is not necessarily to get to the end result, but to practice modeling. So if you're an experienced modeler who wants to kind of just keep on on top of your game. And this is Something different from what normally model, it's a good practice to keep, you know, just keep going. Keep learning with modeling. If you're a brand new user, Then this is a. perfect thing. This is a simple— I'm I don't know I don't know how long this video will be ten, 15 minutes at most, that walk through every single step. So let's do it. Let's hop in. Let's make this thing. All right. So first thing we're do is we're going to create a business card. So I'm just going to come in here and zoom down on the ground. So keep a foot okay. So business cards about that big. I'm going to draw. A business card. So a business card is 3.5in, so 3.5 by 2 inches, 2. And it's that rectangle. So I'm just going to go like that. So yes I could have used the rectangle tool. And no I did not. All right. So this is a business card obviously a real business card has some thickness. I'm not interested in the thickness of a card. I'm interested in the thickness of a stack of cards. So I want to have, you know, some space to put a handful of business cards in here. So let's go ahead and pull this up like what's that like. Yeah 3/8 of an inch. Let's go 3/8 of an inch. All right. And I'm going to. Grab that. And make it a group. All right. So what I want right now I'm going to use rotate real quick just to bring this up. Right. What I want is a thing that's going to hold this. Now I'm almost ready to start building, but there's a couple things I want to do. One is if my business hold card holder, if the holder is exactly three and a half inches, these can be pretty snug, especially if I do 3D print it. And sometimes 3D printing material swirls a little bit as you print because it heats up and cools down, that kind of stuff. So that might be a little bit tight. So I'm going to come in here and I'm going to give it, not a lot, but let's say like an 1/8 inch extra on the edge. That's going to just let me, you know, have a little bit of extra space. So there's room for it, but not so much that my cards are gonna slide around. And I'm going to see them, you know, all over the place. The other thing I want to do is I want to take this, and I want to lean them back slightly. I don't want them just facing straight up. So I going to say like 20, 20 degrees. All right. So what I've created now is basically the negative space I want to maintain when I create this business card holder. So when I make this thing, I don't want it to intrude on any of this space. So this means I can do a couple things. One thing I could do is I could just model a you know, I could come in here and just. Go, okay, here is this, and we'll go like this. And then I Can use Solid Tools, just carve that out and could be done. That's an option. I'm going to go a little bit further than that. We're going to actually create something that's somewhat aesthetically pleasing. So we're gonna do that by tracing around this. So again we're intentionally a little large this way we are—kind of an arbitrary amount this way at 3/8 of an inch. You know, how many cards is that? I don't even know. And then we're exactly the height of a business card here. So as we make our business card holder, we can decide: Is it going to go past the card? Is it going to stay low? We can make that decision as we go. So what I'm going to do is I'm. Going to come in here and I’m going to trace across the bottom with an edge. I'm going to come up here, let's see like a half an inch. Yeah, that sounds good. 1/2”. Enter. And then I'm going to come straight out this way. I'm going to come out I want to have a. Some thickness on this. Let's say, you know, actually, let's do this way. This will be kind of cool. This will look nice. I'm going to come out perpendicular to that by hovering over this edge and coming out to where 90 degrees is. It'll snap to pink, and I'm going to come out this way. Like, say, quarter inch. See how that looks? No, that's too far up. I want to cut that in half. So I'm going to go reference the middle. That's going to be an eighth of an inch. And I'm going to drag that down. I'm going to go along like this. All right. Cool. I'm going to come here. This is the lowest point of the cards. I want that to drop down. I like this eighth inch. When I 3D print stuff an eighth inch wall is a pretty decent thickness. It's heavy duty enough that it's not going to, you know, warp or break easy. But it's not so big I'm wasting filament, so I'm gonna stick with that eighth inch, dimension for my thickness. I'm gonna come here, I'm gonna drop this down an eighth of an inch, and I run this over like that. All right, so let's grab all that and that, and we'll bring that up. It's under ground this way. It's a little bit gray on the bottom there. All right, so there we go. So now looking at from the side this is what the bottom of my my holder is going to look like. So let's, let's let's come up here I'm just going to draw a line like that. Let me go this way. Same thing eight inch I'm going to bring that down like that. I run lines long all the time rather than trying to meet up like this. The problem with just trying to kind of meet up and make sure, well, this is snapping perfectly beautifully, no problem at all. But if I have multiple points in here or real close to like, other geometry, I can sometimes grab the wrong one if I’m out too far. So if I know I want to come along the green axis I'll just run long like this. Then real quick, turn on erase and just erase those two pieces. So, your call, though. You don't have to do what I do. You, you be you. You do your thing. All right, so there we go. That looks pretty good. I think what I'm going to do. So what I want to do is I'm take this geometry and run it along like that to hold the business card. But I think, okay, I just did that so I'm not going to think about it anymore. I'm going to take this and bring it down like a quarter inch. 1/4 Enter. All right. So there we go. So now when I do get down to that last card, it's gonna be real easy to grab it. I have a little bit of room for my finger to slip over and grab it. That looks cool. Okay. Something I don't like so much. Obviously, I need a lip here to hold the bottom, but I'm covering up a good portion of what would be on my business card with this lip. So you could do a couple things. One is I could bring it down lower, which is okay. Problem with that is then it's more likely the cards will fall out. So what I do instead is I want to do something like this. I'm going to go to the middle. I'm going to drop, I'm gonna drop all the way down. I'm going to go inference this point right here. And I'm going to come over this way one inch and I bring it up like that. Yeah. I'm going to take that, option copy it over to here. That looks good. And then I'll just push this back like that. Get rid of that there. So now we can actually see what's in there. I'm going to go a little further I like that, I like that look, but I'm going to get some, get some more space. I'm going to grab this corner but drag it over this way a half inch. And this one. This way a half inch. Yeah. See there. So now my cards are in there nice and secure. They're held in. I know I don't have anything on the end yet. That's, that's still coming. They're in there nice and secure. And I could still see the bulk of what's on my card. I'm covering up a little bit in the corners, but most of what I want to show, my logo or my information, is still going to be visible in here. So let's, let's keep going. Let's get the ends on here. So this right now this is all loose geometry and this is a group. So I can kind of work with this a little bit. I can just take that over like that. And then I'm going to take this out again, that eighth of an inch that I'm trying to use for my material. And then I can also grab this, pull this out like that. And then, if I erase these edges. That all goes together. So now it's holding that in there. If I want to check inside here. I can always temporarily hide this piece. Just make sure everything looks good there. Yep. All right. I’m going to Ctrl Z to undo that and then do the same thing over here. Just a quick edge across. Perpendicular to that. Pull it out an eighth of an inch. Pull this out to the same amount and then erase those extra edges. Good. That looks pretty cool. Now I'm it's possible, but it's unlikely that it's going to stay standing upright with this little tiny foot right here. So let's get some more support. I'm just going to come back like this. I'm going to go up to where it's. Something like that, and then we'll pull that through. I could type in eight inch again, or I could just come over right here and then erase that. I’ll have a line down here. Erase that. That's going to give it enough of a leg to stand on. No, I was going to say no pun intended, but I totally said that as a pun, so, Yeah. Take that how you like. I'm going to bring this over an eight inch too. Boom. Boom. And there we go. All right, let me. Take this and hide this again. That looks pretty good. That looks solid. It's not solid. It's actually. Wide open. So I’m not— I could come in here and I could close up this right here. So it's one big, solid piece. Downside of that, of course, is that's a lot of extra material to print. So I'm not going to do that. I'm going to keep it open like this. And I think that this 20 degrees is a shallow enough angle that most 3D printers could print that without any support. Same thing here, because I'm coming up. I don’t need that edge. I'm coming up here at 20 degrees. I think all of this could be printed with no support. So I could actually sit this right flat on the print bed, print it in place as one piece, no supports or anything. And have a finished business card holder, in, I don’t know, maybe a couple hours of printing, something like that. Hour and a half. I’m going to triple click and make it a group. And if I do want to make sure this is actually 3D printable, I would want to come up here and go to Entity Info make sure it says Solid Group. It currently doesn't. So in, SketchUp for Web or with the Extension Solid Inspector I can always come in here and I can check and see what the problem is, and it's telling me that I do have a stray edge somewhere in here. I could hit fix all, or I could turn on X-Ray, and I could see where it is. And you can see it's right there. So if I turn this off, see, I got that extra edge is floating in there and I can erase that. All right with that. Now we have a Solid Group. Perfect. We could take that then, if I wanted to 3D print—we've done this in other videos, this is not the point of the video—but we could take that, export it as an STL, take it in a slicer, print it out and have this sitting on my desktop ready to hand out my cards. Like I said, in an hour and a half or so. If you wanted, you could take this further. I could put some 3D text right here. I just have to make sure I merge it into the geometry. If I wanted to take this longer, I could take this up higher than the business card and put a logo up there. Something like that. But there you go. Pretty simple. Pretty easy. Basic modeling tutorial. But, you get what you, Yeah. I mean, not bad for ten minutes, huh? Ten minutes. Half an hour—or an hour and a half on the printer, and you got your own, custom made, one of a kind business card holder. Well, one of a kind, except for other people who follow along with this and have one, including myself. But, yeah. There you go. Again, a fun little quick modeling practice thing. I do think that if you're going to get good at SketchUp, the best way to do that is really to just get in there and use it. Stuff like this, if you can spend a couple minutes modeling something that has some real world dimensions to it, it's fun to do just fantasy models, right? Just model a castle or whatever. That's a that's a great time. But sometimes a little bit of precision is a good way to get good at, you know, precision modeling. Makes sense, right? But this in particular, like I said, we had very specific dimensions. But at the same time, we want to give ourselves a little bit of space so things work together. We've got to be conscious of how thick the walls of things are, that kind of thing. So. Yeah, try it out. Let me know what you think of this. Do you like this kind of modeling practice? This is a fun way to spend ten minutes. Tell us what you think about this, because we're always playing with our video types, making sure you guys get what you want to see, what you want to watch. And, we know that most by hearing from you. If you like the video, click like down below. And if you haven't already, please do subscribe. We create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe. Most importantly though, like I said, leave us a comment. Let me know what you think of this. If you think there's some other model that would make a good video like this, or if there's a whole other topic or type of video you think we should make that we haven't yet. Let us know about that down there too. We like making these videos a lot, but we like an even more when they're showing something you want to see. Thank you.
