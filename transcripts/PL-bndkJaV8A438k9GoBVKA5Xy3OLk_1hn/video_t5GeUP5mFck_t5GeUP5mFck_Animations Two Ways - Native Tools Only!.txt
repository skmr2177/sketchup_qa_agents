hey everybody Eric here today I want to do a quick refresher on working with animations using native Tools in SketchUp but more importantly I want to look at actually two different ways to do animations right here right now [Music] so when I say two different ways to do animations I think we all know hopefully by now that sort of the animation tools or features in SketchUp are kind of designed for architectural fly-throughs so when we have a scene we can move from one part of the model to another we move the camera from one part of the model or the viewer and that's where we're animating sort of we're animating the camera path but there actually is a way to animate objects just using native tools as well so let's do kind of a quick review of some tips and tricks to get this process to hopefully work a little bit smoother or at least anticipate the results that you want um right now together so let's just go ahead and get to it okay so I've got my model here this is the Turning torso in Malmo Sweden if anyone's been there or recognize it and I've got this gal down here in uh the first animation kind of I wanted to do was just I don't know I'm just pretending as if I'm there in real life which would be awesome which I'm not but let's let's just say that someday I'll hope to get there and until then I'm going to live vicariously through this um scale figure so in this case I would set up what is my starting scene and I'm going to use a keyboard shortcut to do that so you need scenes to in order to be able to do animations I don't need any of these other windows open right now I will need my scenes panel in just a minute so I'll leave that here so you gotta have a scene to do an animation because you need to be able to know that you're moving from One camera angle to another I also want to open up under model info there are some animation settings here under this first tab animations so by default when you first open SketchUp you'll notice that we have scene transitions turned on so what that means is for those that are sort of brand new to SketchUp if I moved my camera in this case I'm just going to move my my eyeball I'm going to look from down to up and add a scene what it's going to do when I click back and forth you're going to see it's actually animating the difference between those two now I'll say that by default when I'm working not by default with SketchUp but my default is basically to turn this off and then I save that as a template so every time I open a new SketchUp file I want to go from scene to scene I want it to change instantly so that's actually the opposite of animating actually while I'm working I want to make sure that I'm not seeing any camera movement but since we're animating we want that on so let's think about quickly how long we think that sort of transition needs to be by default it might be I think two seconds to sketchup's default but let's say I want to slow that down a little bit and enter something like five seconds so you're going to see that we're going to get a much slower pan now as she sort of tilts her camera and you know cranes her neck back and sort of gets the whole Tower into the view now if you have multiple scenes you can delay between them now I only have two so there's really technically no delay but if I had a third one and I wanted to pause here for a moment I can add a delay like for example I want to add a three second delay before I go to look to my next spot so let's do another scene I'm going to this case I'm going to instead of animating just what I'm seeing from the ground level I'm actually going to lift myself off maybe this is a drone's eye view so I'm actually going to try to sort of stay somewhat in that position well let me go back actually because I think I rotated oh here's a tip you can disable scene transitions as you're navigating so that you don't have to wait like I just did where I was like oh I want to go back to the beginning scene well in this case you don't have to if you turn this off while you're navigating that actually helps you out a lot because you don't have to wait that five seconds so here if I stop here and then I want to kind of just lift the camera up from here so I want to my eye height right now is at eight feet what happens if I put in something like 200 feet 300 feet I don't know I haven't done this 500 feet I'm trying to get somewhat to the top of the tower so I'm just guessing um so that's cool that gets me to the top of the tower let's put something like 1 000 feet I actually want to get not only do I want to be up but I want to look down at the tower so just be careful that if you turn like this you're going to notice that the camera will twist as it goes so you kind of want to hold if you can somewhat of the same orientation that you used when you were um when you were at the ground so I want to get this sort of bird's eye view so I'm going to add that scene and then because my scene transitions are disabled I can pop back to my last view turn on scene Transitions and then see what that sort of call it the drone camera shot looks like and that was pretty cool that was pretty smooth so five seconds was good I could slow that down if I wanted to but again if this was part of a longer animation that five seconds or six seconds it's going to apply to all of the scenes so just something to keep in mind as far as the pacing now I have a slide delay time for three seconds in here now you didn't see it because I was only going between the two scenes but let's go all the way back to the beginning and let's see what that looks like so let's go ahead and play this whole animation from the beginning and see what it looks like so this time I want to make sure I'm I'm on my first scene I've got my scene transitions on my slide delay on I'm going to click right click on the first one and say play animation now there may be a delay on the beginning as well so you'll notice that we're not actually moving yet so that's sort of I don't know whether that's the scene transition personally or whether that's the slide delay that creates that pause before it actually starts um and now so we've got you'll notice that there was a little bit of a pause next scene pause for a moment and we're going to loop back to the beginning so we're going to go all the way back to the beginning and we're going to see that again so let's stop there I'm going to turn this off by saying disable so stop play animation and for right now I'm just going to uncheck scene transitions we can use those again and slide delay time I'll set that back to zero we'll probably come back to that in just a second but let's look at one more way to do animations I said there's in my intro that there's two ways so the first one is pretty straightforward that was animating the where how to look around from a fixed position moving the camera and adjusting the slide delay and the transitions in order to sort of get the camera movements that you you desire but let's pretend for example that this woman here is waiting for her let me flip her around the other way I'll use my handy dandy mirror tool to sort of flip her so that she's looking back towards the tower and she's waiting for her Uber but unfortunately the little citrons that you might find in Sweden um are busy so they're gonna they are passing her by so I want to actually animate an object instead of the camera path now so if I turn my hidden objects on you'll see that I've already sort of arrayed some out here for this I'm going to start with now I would probably do this in a new file but because you I can't necessarily separate out the um I can't separate out two different animations so for in this example I would have to start over sort of from scratch now I have these cars hidden and they're hidden for a reason because I've already sort of copied multiple objects and what I want to do is I only want to show one person so in this case I would add a scene using keyboard shortcut and then I would come over here and hide this one so just like keyframing we're basically keyframing but we're using an actual object so I'm using copies of the component I'm going to add a new scene actually before I do that this is a kind of a fun trick that I wanted to share that maybe you don't know is that you can actually play animations without the camera location being checked so that way objects will move navigate as the animation is playing you'll see that in just a second it's kind of a fun little trick I I hope um I hope you'll like so now with the second car showing and the first one hidden I can go ahead and add a new scene just basically same process hide unhide add and then hide unhide add and just one more hide unhide and add now I may actually want to do one more where I hide all of them so that way this sort of like gives just a little bit of a pause where there's no cars now what happens when I press the scene you can see if I just click through the scenes the car is kind of appearing to move that's kind of cool now that one should be hidden so I'm going to update that I'm gonna try that one more time there we go it disappears so it drives out of the camera frame at that point and then when you get back to scene one it comes back in the camera frame so let's see what happens now in this case we don't want scene Transitions and if we have no slide delay time what happens let's see what it looks like when we play the animation it's going very fast there's literally no delay between scenes so it's just going continuously a little too fast let's slow that down let's go to something like 0.5 seconds in between scenes it's a little slow it's almost like um watching you know an animation that's or a YouTube video that's buffering and it's taking a little while so let's try point two and see what happens a little bit better a little choppy still 0.1 okay it seems to drive a little bit smoother here now of course the smoother that you want it you probably have you can add more cars which means more keyframes and more scenes now let's pause let's turn this off for a second I'm going to wrap up by saying remember that I turned off camera location well if I come over here I can actually navigate using the look around or I can come over here and just use my hand tool so now this woman this poor woman's waiting for her Uber and or her lift and it's just not coming they just won't stop for her um or her taxi so unfortunately she's just gonna have to maybe walk to her next destination so in this case you can see that we've animated the camera path and we've animated we've animated an object now as this car sort of comes in and out of the scene and if I stand right in front of it let's see if this works oh yeah okay I can't really get it it's a little hard I'll be honest with you it's a little bit tricky to navigate there we go looks like the car is coming right at us maybe we don't want to stand in the middle of the street maybe we should stand off to the site okay so I'm going to stop there because otherwise I'm just gonna have too much fun and I'm just gonna keep going and this is going to run on and you're going to say Eric stop you got to know when to stop so I'm going to stop that animation right there and I'm going to transition really quick I want to transition just to say thank you um always always as always thank you for watching these videos thanks for entertaining me and letting me play around here with some animations with you today I hope that you learned something new even if you knew already sort of how scene Transitions and scene delay time in between transitions or in between scenes even if you already knew how that works because that those features have been around for a long time those are classic SketchUp features but even just unchecking that camera location when you have an object that's moving it's kind of a cool trick I actually made a scale figure move and dance which I thought was kind of a fun idea you can make a ballerina twirl there are things like even maybe animating water there are some things that where this feature could come in handy But ultimately you know it's it's my job to demonstrate it and it's your job to figure out hey how can I use this in my project so I hope you can find a use for this in your project and as always don't forget to like like again comment share subscribe and stay tuned I will see you next time [Music]
