hey there it's Matt here and today I'm going to show you how I modeled a door in SketchUp in fact this very two- panel door that you see in front of [Music] you so in order to model this first I'm going to need to get some Dimensions with a tape measure so I measured the thickness of the door the height and width and then the distances between all the panels I'm also going to take a picture of the door um just to use for reference for the details of the panel try to get the camera as perpendicular to the door as possible to have as little Distortion as I can I'll try to correct for any imperfections in the perspective when I took the picture and then I'll crop right to the edges of the door okay cool that's everything I need now I can hop into SketchUp okay so um first I will draw the outline of the door Leaf so using the rectangle I'll hit the uh left Arrow key to snap to the green plane here and then um it was 29.5 by 80 so here's my magical door here um I'll actually make a copy of it first using the move and the um modifier key and I'm just going to bring in that um photo that I took of the door downloads here we go use as texture and then here in here it doesn't have to be perfect because I'll go into um position texture and uh if you don't see these pins if you see these ones I'll use the fixed pins for this so I'll right click on one of the pins and say fixed pins and then that way just going to try to move these so that they are sometimes we might have to zoom in to make small adjustments okay and then I'll push this um out 1.5 and this actually needs to be flipped so I'll go texture position and right click here and say flip left right that way it is correct on both sides and maybe this is all I need um for my model but I will triple click to select that all and make a group and then now so this is kind of a a photo texture version of the door here I'll do the uh the the modeled version so uh again I'll push that 1.5 and then I'm going to offset this 5 in um that was the the offset on the sides the top offset is actually Four in so I'll just move this up one and then on the bottom it's 8 and a half half so I'll move it up uh 3.5 this bottom panel here is 24 uh Ines so I will move this bottom with a copy modifier 24 and then the Gap here is 6 and 3/4 delete these extras and now I have my two panels um I'll also make the door handle hole right now so it's 36 up and 2.5 across and this opening is 2 and 3/4 which is 1 and 38 radius can push that to the back and delete these guides okay now for the um the detail on the door these measurements here they're very small and they kind of are just nothing like they're not important like they don't matter so I'll just kind of eyeball it here so I'm going to I'll move all this closer so I can be right in right in there offset it a little bit and move that back in the green uh we'll say 116th offset again offset and move offet a little bit and again I'm just straight up eyeballing this here we go move this back up this this piece kind of comes out a little bit and our last little offset this will move it's actually flush with the door okay so there we have our detail in order to replicate that same profile on the top at first I was like okay maybe I can like you know make a face consisting of these angles and then use follow me on this on this top panel I don't have to do that I'll keep it easy here um what I'm going to do is delete this panel left to right selection to select all the geometry in here and just copy that straight up and then I can just copy that top uh geometry in order to not stretch it but I will use the sticky geometry from SketchUp and that way boom I have the panel with the same profile in the top and bottom um one thing you can notice here just from a visual style these are pretty like soft they don't really show the edges here um but in SketchUp obviously these one pixel edges do show what I'm going to do is select left to right on these and I'm going to rightclick and say select and deselect faces I just want the edges here and then I'm going to go into entity info and hide the edges now it looks like they've disappeared but when I turn on Shadows you can see those and it looks a lot more realistic than um before when it was the actual edges um I want to put the same panel on the back right now there's nothing on the back um so I'll delete this back face and what I'm going to do is do a left to right selection to select everything this touches here and I'll use the flip command so I'll use the flip tool and copy modifier using the green and go from the midpoint of that to flip and again you can't see that because of the Shadows but I'm supposing if I turned ambient occlusion on here you can see that that geometry or hidden geometry you can see that that's in there which is what we want okay cool at this point this is the door Leaf completed I'll triple click to select all that and make it a component door leaf move it over just a bit um I'm also going to add the door knob in here it's not going to be super high detailed but um you know you got a door you got to have a door knob so I'll inference the center of this circle and pull that out the same uh actually maybe a little bit more than the ho and then I'm going to draw a profile to do a follow me for the the handle here this actually comes out two and a half so I'll use a guide to move that to the right spot and I'm not going to do a super accurate version of the door knob here but just enough to give you an idea of what's going on I'll just a little handle here and somewhere here delete that extra stuff I don't need select that Circle tools follow me and there's our handle it look a little big triple click to select all that geometry and uh make that a group what I'm going to do is go back into this group select it all and again use that flip modifier around the midpoint to make the handle on both sides and then cut that uh using command X go into this group paste in place so now if I do uh open the door that handle will come with it one last thing for the door is the door frame so what I'm going to do is has come down to the floor here and the measurement that I got was [Music] four 4.5 and I'll just do one inch here and then this interior one was uh 1.5 1.5 and half an inch and to make the frame what I'm going to do is just draw the profile select those three edges using the shift key make sure that last one hey where'd you go Bud get that last one and then again tools follow me select the profile triple click and make that data group and then now I'm going to select everything here and make this a component this is our door assembly okay now I can open that door up hey I got a fine fine enough looking door for my model and there you have it that's how I model this thing wait this thing but um let me know if you would have done anything differently um you know is there other things that you would include that I didn't you know hinges or other door related things um let me know uh if you like this kind of format a video of how to model A blank and SketchUp let us know other things you'd like us to model down below uh don't forget to hit the thumbs up button and uh give us a like And subscribe if you're not already subscribed we make a lot of videos over here and uh if you want to learn more SketchUp or if you want to see some cool stuff being done with SketchUp the SketchUp YouTube channel is the place to do it so uh yeah thanks for watching and we'll see you next time thanks
