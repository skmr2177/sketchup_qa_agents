hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to talk a little bit about how arcs and circles work inside a SketchUp so this topic has actually come up a couple of times recently in uh I've seen it in some posts on the Forum and comments on videos uh just about exactly how it works um as far as something would be called a true Arc or a true Circle versus the segmented geometry that's created by SketchUp so I want to dive in and talk how that works um exactly what happens and what you can expect and what you actually need to do with it let's take a look all right so first things first uh this we have here I just drew a little a circle and an arc and if I pick on it you can actually see it if I zoom in on the circle you can see the segments see these little it's a series of straight lines that connect together into a circle this is how SketchUp draws this geometry so it draws this in a series of segments it's what makes it so quick and easy to create geometry like this is that it's actually just working with a bunch of surfaces um just we're start with faction I'm going to talk about how you'd use it yet but just to start with the basics a default Circle has 24 sides you can see here if I select the circle I look in the entity info I can see how many I have here if I want to I could actually come in and make that more or less if I type 12 you'll see those segments much more pronounced if I jump up something like 48 they're harder to see if I jump double that to 96 don't worry I did that math ahead of time I'm not doing that on the Fly you can see that they they virtually go away if I zoom in here eventually I will be able to see the actual individual lines from here to here but they're significantly smaller this is of course when you come in to draw a circle so if I if I come in here and I go Circle uh in the measurements box down here it says how many sides we want to draw in and then as I pull that across and I'm going to do something exact measurement I'm going to make this 10 inch radius and uh that means from one side to the other is exactly 20. but I can change that as I put it in so if I come in here this is the reason I did this if I if I select the circle it's going to tell me this is a 10 inch radius so if I draw a line from one side straight across the other side it's going to tell me that that is one foot eight dynamometers box 20 inches so this is important to note so if I go from here to here 20 inches that line is 20 inches one foot eight now if I go from the next segment to the next segment down same thing it's going to tell me that's one foot eight if I split that right if I go in the middle if I go from the middle of this Edge to the middle of this Edge my measurements box says that is approximately one foot seven and thirteen sixteenths so from the middle of this surface I'm not or this this face right here I'm not actually getting that full 20 inches I'm getting about 3 16 less so this is important this is I mean of of all the stuff we're talking about this is probably one of the most important parts when you look at a circle SketchUp knows that this circle is created based on this 10 inch radius so from the center to any of these points is always going to be 10 inch what happens in between though is it's chopping that chunk off so it is a little bit off it's just something to note so if if I ever have uh you know something where I need to come in and come up with an exact measurement at this circle cut into so many sides I need to make sure that those points I'm cutting at are at points this is why we make a big deal about when you draw a circle how many segments you use we always a lot of times we'll recommend put your segments in and call it you know something that's a divisible by four so you always have the same number of segments in each quadrant how many in there is going to depend on what you're using it for so if I wanted to do something where I was doing a lot of tangential work like circles bumping up against circles or arcs coming off of circles something like that it's going to be a little more tricky with SketchUp than maybe some other drawing program that's that's uh you know a different Vector based program because I'm not necessarily going to have those points where I need them to figure out like tangential connections or anything like that so it is important to make sure you understand where those points are and that those points are on the circle whereas the lines actually cut inside SketchUp does remember that this is a circle so as long as it's a circle here I can do things like I can change my radius I can change the segments I can do that sort of thing as I'm working with the circle because it remembers that until I do something like say I come in here and I push pull this up so now it still remembers this is a circle but because it's connected to other geometry I can't change the segments so the points I have on here are the only points I will have as long as this is connected to this other geometry same thing goes for RX as I draw arcs so I drove through this Arc drew it as 12 just snapped it across to a point same thing here I can come in here and I can increase or decrease the number of points in this Arc and again if I look if I if I come in here and let's see let's make this something nice and even we'll make this exactly three foot so if I come in here and I draw a line from here back to the center of that radius that line is exactly three foot so any of these points back to the radius is going to show exactly three foot from in between if I go to the center point of one of these segments there it's 2 foot 11 11 16. so it's not going to show the same because the actual true Arc goes just outside of that by a couple sixteenths of an inch now this is good to know and I'll be totally honest for a lot of geometries gets created for architecture larger models like that this is perfectly fine this is having this broken into segments and sometimes can actually work in your benefit because you can break it down into pieces that you're going to work with there's sometimes going to be more conscious or increased geometry so let's look at a couple examples so let's say this geometry that I created this this Arc and this circle are getting used to create maybe this is a site plan this is I know super simplified but I want you to see the original geometry here's this here's this um is this going to matter is this going to be significant to show where this circular building sits on this site plan with an arc here I don't know maybe maybe in a case like so if I'm just looking this from above and this is I'm going to lay out and put some dimensions on here and this is all that it is this is probably okay this is probably fine if I'm going to go in and maybe I have these these are some sort of Steel panels that have to be detailed that wrap around a circle probably not going to work right because if I go view hidden geometry and I see this this is a flat panel this is a flat panel this is a flat panel so it's not going to be ideal to to detail out these pieces now maybe these pieces are just big flat pieces like this and this is actually how it's being built if so great if I actually need details of this geometry curving around the true Circle I'm going to want to increase the number of sides for the circle first before I come in and extrude it so in that case I don't know it's possible it's enough information it's possible it is enough geometry but I'm might be a little bit short if I need to go into more detailing this so let's talk about scaling stuff down and uh say we're printing this out so I'm going to put this into a 3D print and print it out I'll take this and I'm going to do a follow me just create something like that so say these are pieces I'm going to actually print out is this enough information is this enough sides so these are both 24 this donut or washer or whatever you want to call it uh 24 size 24 sides is that going to be big enough well if this whole thing is like a quarter inch across you know what that should be more than enough detail to get me the circle that I need same thing here this little this little tube thing I'm creating here say this is like an inch across like that 24 sides is more than enough now if this is much larger this is going to be cut up into multiple pieces and this is going to fill my print bed a whole bunch of times since the detail of a building or something like that then I probably want to increase the number of sides same thing here if this is going to be a large piece that I want to print the size of a pool noodle I'm going to actually see these segmented sides when I print it so the question comes across well why don't I just put all of my circles in as you know 96 sides or 999 sides why don't I just make them all that big well the issue comes very quickly in the amount of geometry putting a SketchUp so it is going to behave quicker more Snappy better I'm going to have fewer snap points to snap to if I don't have all those extra points so again depending what I'm doing a lot of times we'll scale my circles or my arcs depending on how big the geometry is so this is a small piece of detail I might go with 12 even sides because I don't even need 24 if this is only you know a quarter inch across something large say this is a foot across here I'll probably bump that up if I'm 3D printing it out it's like 96 sides just to give myself a little more smoothness around the outside but then other practical applications come in too right am I going to take that am I going to sand it to remove the print lines anyhow if so those segments are less important or mean a little bit less at that point another example what if I'm going to take this and I'm going to export this to a CNC machine to get cut out of a piece of plywood well this is a whole different answer because if I export this geometry as a 3D dxf it's important a 3D dxf not a 2d you have an option when you export dxfs do 2D or 3D so even though it's cut flat if you export this as a 3D dxf that 3D dxf is going to take this segmented Circle and translate it into a true curve same with this Arc as long as these aren't broken right so as long as this is a one Circle and this is one Arc it's going to look at the radius and it's going to export that geometry as a true Arc it's going to export this circle as a true Circle so the file that exports and actually goes to your CNC will give you nice true curves even though I see segments right here inside of SketchUp so I'm hoping that cleared up the questions or concerns uh of how SketchUp deals with these arcs and like I said this is just fundamental this is how the the drawing program works is how it creates that geometry um so it's kind of fundamental to the function of SketchUp the important thing is that you understand how it works and how it works in relation to what you are modeling for we talk about this all the time level of detail is extremely important but it is also extremely tightly tied to what you're doing if your whole goal is to create something that you're going to go render totally different needs and requirements in your model than if what you're taking is going to go to a CNC machine or a 3D printer so it's important to model to what your final deliverable is going to be and that's just another thing you need to keep in mind is how circles and arcs are going to work in that case if you like that video click like down below and if you
