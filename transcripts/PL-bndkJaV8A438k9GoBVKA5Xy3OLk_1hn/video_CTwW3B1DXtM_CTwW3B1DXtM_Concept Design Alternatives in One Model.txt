hey everyone Eric here today I want to share with you some of my tips for creating concept design Alternatives basically seeing two different designs in one model until you're ready to make a decision on what to move forward with so I hope it's pretty self-explanatory sometimes in the design process we either intentionally want to show two or three different concepts in order to get the client or the stakeholders feedback we do that on purpose sometimes we'll we know which option we want to move forward with as a designer but not always you know can we just pick that and go we kind of make sure that the client's feedback is taken into consideration so when you've got a model and you've got some pieces in it already I want to look at some ways to maybe streamline or optimize that process to make it a little bit easier so you're not saving a duplicate model and then saying oh here's model one here's model two and then in which case if you change a door change a wall now all of a sudden the models are out of sync so I want to do those concept Alternatives inside of one model and let's just go ahead and do it right now so I've got my model you've seen this before I'm going to plug it from our scan SketchUp campus course I'm going to reference that at the end I'm just going to kind of get started here so what works really well about this model in particular this design is that it's an interior design project so when I say concept alternatives I guess I'll be a little bit more specific and say in this case Furnishing alternatives now let me go and put myself into the kitchen here just kind of explain the space if you haven't seen us model before it's a co-working space and there's a kitchen and try not to get stuck in a wall if I look over here there's uh this is sort of what I'm calling the default concept so if you come in you've got a kitchen and you've got well maybe actually it's better to see it in plan View there you go Reception Area kitchen workstations lounge and sort of built-in bin cut seating so just for fun we're going to go ahead and flip this part of the design this kind of section over here we're going to flip that around so that we can see what that might look like if it was if we rearranged it and said well maybe that's not exactly where things need to go so the first thing I need to do is I've actually kind of already done it but basically is you want to kind of group the different things now you could make it a component but if you want to make changes like when I when I do my alternative design if you make a change like move a table of course it's going to change it in both designs so in this case what I've done is I've got everything's a component like chairs component table is a component all of it everything's a component but then when I put them in a container that container is a group so that was sort of done intentionally so I've got kind of my lounge or a area and seating area group and I've got this workstation kind of co-working space so let me switch over to perspective maybe that's a little bit easier to see it now in this case one to do is I'm actually going to make a group out of both of those if I hold shift here I can get both of those and then I'm going to copy it I'm using my keyboard shortcut and paste it in place so now you can't see it because they're sitting on top of each other but I actually have two of the same seating arrangement now for simplicity's sake I'm going to go ahead and use or just kind of speed up I'm going to use the scale by negative one tool of course you could use the new flip in 2023 if you prefer to use that method and it's a little bit confusing here because I have two sets of furniture sitting on top of each other I have my original which I'm calling alternative or concept one and then I have my flipped or my inverted version which I'm going to call Concept 2. so the first step in this process is right now everything's showing we need separate tags so that we can toggle things on and off now I already have everything tagged I have my Furnishings I have my details my custom woodwork all that stuff's already tagged I'm going to leave those alone so this is basically a container tag for each of the design alternatives one two tags first one I'm going to call alt one does not matter necessarily what you want to call it at home and ALT two so alt one again I said is sort of the default option so this sort of outside container group containing all of this Arrangement this furniture I'm just going to put that on one and then if I turn that off you can see that disappears and then this kind of flipped version where I put the co-working tables over closer to the reception desk I'm going to call that alt 2. now that's fine and good so there they go I can switch back and forth between them it's a little bit tricky when you do it just using the tags here because it's not difficult to say hey what does this look like and then you go alt one on alt two off but to me especially if I'm doing a live presentation I don't even really want to show the two Alternatives overlapping at the same time I want to show one and then the other especially if they're different in this case they're just mirrored or flipped but if they're very different I would want something a little bit more seamless than just tagging turning the tags on and off so what I want to do here is I want to come in and it doesn't really matter I'm going to start on this perspective just because I want to add one to the end of my little Dean sequence here and I'm going to call this one alt one and I'm going to make sure that alt 2 is turned off and that scene is updated and I'm going to add that same scene in this case I'm going to call it Alt 2. and then I'm going to flip those alt 1 and all two okay so now that's great so I can flip between these two scenes and I can see what that design looks like from this particular camera angle but I've got a couple different camera angles I want to look at I've got this view from the lounge area which is originally this was all this was originally when it was designed as a lounge and then I've got this view from the kitchen so I want to see what both of those look like but if I hit the alt one it takes me back to the lounge so this is a really kind of simple trick or fix that I like to recommend is that you can just disable the camera location so in this case it's not about where I'm viewing the alternative one versus alternative two it's actually more about just saving the tag States so I don't have to do that to tag or three tag turn off and on little juggle that I had to do alt 1 and ALT two both have camera location turned off so if I wanted to I could pick any perspective like in this case this perspective kitchen is not my final view you can see it's got everything turned on more importantly as I would click on the perspective kitchen to set the camera angle and then alt one to turn the tag State on same thing if I wanted to compare that same view to alt 2 and Export that I could go back and forth and either show that on a screen or export those very easily same thing works from that opposite angle on that scene that I've already saved if I just go alt one this is kind of the default option what it looked like before and then this is the alternative to it's the other alternative like the the inverted or the flipped alternative so what's cool about that is because we're not locked to camera angle if I wanted to come over here if I was doing a live presentation and I said okay well when you come in if the client says well what does it look like I really like it I'm having a hard time deciding which one I like better they both work really well actually you could say well what does it look like from from the door when you come in and then all you have to do is Click alt one alt two this is what alt one looks like you can then look around the room I like that you can go all two look around the room and say yeah that works um you know of course we may want to treat this bookshelf a little bit differently the way that we had it sort of embedded into a Nook on the other alternative that kind of tells you that maybe you know you'd also have to treat the wall around the bookshelf as well to kind of get that integrated as well so again if I just kind of wanted to been around the only thing to keep in mind here is that if you are showing something in plan view remember that scenes remember sections are saved to Styles not scenes so in this case the alt 1 and ALT 2 doesn't work in plan view because I would need the section cut style saved so if you were working with sections you just have to keep that in mind you may want to just sort of either tell the story through Section Cuts or tell the story through perspectives because the way that they work is going to be slightly different just between the two of them so that's actually it I mean you can do as many Concepts as you want and you just follow the same process so make sure that you have a group that sort of represents your alternative that that's tagged to its own name so it's clear and then that's assigned or toggled off or on depending on whether you want to show it and that's assigned a scene and then d uh basically unchecking that camera location that's totally an option for you as well because in that case it does give you that sort of freedom and flexibility to move around the space and you can just toggle those Alternatives off and on without having to go again back into the tags menu and turn everything on and then turn things off one on uh one by one so as always I hope you found something useful in this video I mean even if it's just hey that camera location thing I haven't used that in a while that's a good reminder that you can use that to your advantage and sort of use it a little bit differently than how you maybe normally use scenes to sort of Lock and fix that camera location so let us know what you think in the comments either way so I use that information that you give me take that feedback incorporate it into the next series of videos we make so either way let us know what you think and while you're there commenting don't forget to like share and subscribe you know we with subscriptions you get those notifications especially because we do more than just uh here at SketchUp we do more than just the YouTube videos we do live streams on Fridays and we do SketchUp campus and speaking of which this model here behind me I did say I was going to plug it when I'm not doing these videos on YouTube and doing them live streaming I am building the campus content so that's learn.sketchup.com so this model that I used here in this little demo you can see it rendered here behind me on the splash page that's basically a full length course starting from scratch all the way to building out this model including this tip that I shared just now about creating concept design Alternatives so so I'm going to leave you there and I want to say as always thanks for watching and see you next time [Music]
