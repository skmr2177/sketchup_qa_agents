hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at creating a model with multiple different levels of detail in one model in a model detail yeah that all makes sense uh so in the live stream we just did uh you can check out if you don't know we do live streams here on YouTube also you can check that video out but I created a piece of construction Hardware a truss hanger and we created it with multiple different levels of detail so the the highly detailed all the screw holes and everything a lower level of detail it was just to you know suggest that there was a connector there and then a 2d version that would be used in layout and we took all those different versions and put them into one component so I wanted to hop in and just run through that last part not the modeling part but just how to create a component with all those and then also how to take advantage of tags and scenes to make it easy to switch between those levels of detail let's check it out okay so here are the three things I made so right here this is like I said the the hero model this has all the the features the bells the whistles you know all that stuff so you can see there's a lot to this model this is a great model if I'm if I'm doing a framing detail or something like that to show how this is connected in and how my my uh joist is going to sit in here or my truss is going to sit in here this is awesome this would be a great uh thing to have but it's a lot of geometry for you know there may have 60 of these in one run of the floor or something like that so it's okay it's it's good to have it's like I said good for details but there's a chance I'm not going to actually want all this detail in my model that's where the stand in comes in so this is two-dimensional it's just a couple surfaces it's the same color gray that I used over here and uh this is nice because it shows you know from a distance if I'm looking at my model I can see there's a connector there but not necessarily all the geometry I have here so this will actually keep your model light and more performant by having this on and then the third level of detail the lowest level is right here so this is kind of a this is just a 2d representation so the idea here is this is what I would turn on if I was in layout to show that there is a hanger here because no matter either of these in layout Looking Down plan View from Above are just going to look like little tin lines and if you zoom out far enough they're going to disappear into the lines of the members anyhow so you're going to lose them completely this one right here though this does make it so you can actually see the call out for a connector so this is the first so we got these jumped here each of these is if I bring up my entity info see each of these is its own group okay that's where we're starting from so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start by creating three tags so um I'm going to call it uh we'll just call it level one and then we'll create a level two enter and then we'll create another one called you guys probably correct this code huh level three all right so now I'm going to take each of these and assign them to one of those levels so level one will be by base level the most the simplest level so I'm going to call this level one this guy right here e is going to be level two and then our hero are our close-up our special guy here good looking guy level three so now as I turn these different levels off they're gonna disappear so I can you can see I just get one of the three levels available or visible at one time pretty simple that part's easy but now we're gonna do is we're gonna put them all in the exact same place so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna grab this first one and grab it by the Middle Point here and move it across the red axis to line up to the Middle Point here we go and then same thing here this one I actually have a line here so I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a quick line like this just to inference because then I can grab that middle line when I move it over see it doesn't come with because it was never selected but the selection stays uh selected and uh leaves my extra line behind so I can I can inference something that's not actually coming with so I'm going to again go along the red axis and drop this again right lining up to the middle so that's where I want so there is some intention to how this stuff is modeled uh this one that has no depth you can see it is away from where the actual joist will be it's pushed out a little bit same thing with these guys these little black lines are pushed away from where they will be so they can be seen easy from above all that's intentional so this is actually properly lining up I can go ahead and erase this now I can grab all of these right click and make it into a new component and I could call this I would probably call this the part number uh the manufacturer whatever information I wanted I would put that info in here I'm saying pretty generic here but you'd actually want to put that specific information in the other thing I want to do is I am going to set my Axis so I want to pick the point that I want to place this by so I think what I would probably do I would probably place this by the center of the back of the bucket here and that would be the part point that I would line up oh actually it won't be right here see how these cut back a little bit so it actually I'm going to use another line real quick draw a line at the green axis and I'm going to snap out to here that's the point I want to place it by so we'll do that again make component call it hanger connector whatever set component and I'm going to use this point right here click twice and create and get rid of that X point there now when I bring it in it'll still use that point that was out there even though I don't have to have geometry to have a placement point so there we go so with that this this component this hanger component is ready to be put into the model and I can at any point I can come in here and I can turn my levels of detail different and see all the pieces show up right so that will show up in my components so if I come over here let's drag this smaller that was a huge component hold up hold up hold up what's going on here or need that much real estate there we go shrink that down back to tags all right so these are the things I have in here I'm going to grab this one and when I go to place it that's actually the one I made initially that was wrong I'm gonna go to place this one there we go see how that snap point is at the back right there I should probably just get rid of this that's just that's just going to confuse me you better delete that um right now I'll grab this guy and I'm going to come over here I'm going to do is I'm going to swing underneath I have these just joists and a head right here so I'm just go to the midpoint right there and click to place it now because I only have my level three turned on I'm just seeing putting in that one piece so all these other ones because they're part of it they show up automatically flip down from above oh perfect so that's exactly what I want so what I can do is I can grab this one then let's go ahead and I'm just going to do a move and move copy from here to here and one two three four four x and then I put in a round of connectors and then again each of those connectors now as the ability to switch between levels of detail so this level detail like I was saying before this is what I would use for layout so if I go into my camera I turn parallel projection looking straight down that's going to show like you no matter how far back I pan I'm always be able to see that little Mark there super super helpful if you're going to lay out inside SketchUp the other two levels of detail of course can help if I have a hundred of these things then seeing that you know just this reference oh there is a connector there it doesn't really matter I don't need a detail perfect keep my my model light and snappy and then of course I said level three this is where I'm going to come in with a detailed view showing you know make sure you put these nails and these nails in that kind of stuff that's where I'm going to use something like that now it's nice having the tags over here but really it's kind of it's It's Not Awesome to go okay I'm gonna turn on this one and turn this off each time I got to do that I gotta do multiple clicks to make that happen so what I can do if I want is I can come into scenes and I can create a new scene I'm going to expand this down the only thing I want to actually show is visible tags with that turned on I can hit Plus and that's going to be call that one level one no this is level three and then my tags I'll change to two create a new scene oops I re I put the comment in scene one it is it is these are the details that are important when you're creating your details all right and this will be level two description and then finally let's turn on one and create one more and call that level one so by creating a scene with only the visible tags checked that's the only attribute that has been saved so as I come up here goof that one up level three and hit enter so now coming up here as I'm rotating through I can just real quickly up between those three levels of detail without having to worry about like camera jumping around I don't have to go toggle tags on and off effect I can just close my UI up all together and I can real quickly jump from one another this is not necessary but it's a nice option depending on the number of tags you have and that kind of thing how things are set up this might might or might not work for you but uh in this case from if I say I was doing just a floor layout I might not have a whole lot more tags than uh than something like this and I could include other pieces of detail in there also but uh yeah an option the important part is that I have this one component and that one component consists of all these different levels of detail which are toggled on and off by hitting tags or in this case eventually maybe scenes so there's a lot of stuff we did in a live stream and if you have any interest in what you just saw you might want to go check it out we record live streams most Fridays and then we make them available on our YouTube channel too so you can check that out uh was where we created the geometry and all that but I thought that the the creating the level of detail was something that was worth you know having its own Standalone piece because the idea of having one component you drop in once and then being able to switch through what's actually shown in it I think that's just a huge thing like a huge uh feature to have in your model and especially if it's a reusable component I could save this component out and drop this into any model or make it part of my template and then it's always available to just pull in and I can view it at any level of detail without having to mess with anything so kind of a cool option to have uh that's it for today uh if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe you'll get notified of videos like this when they come out and like I said the live stream you'll get notified about that too most importantly they'll leave us a comment down below do you use different levels of detail in SketchUp do you have a different trick that I didn't touch on is there something specific you think would make a good video and we would show or something you want to learn like making these com these videos a lot like me more on the showing something you want to see which we learned from by the comments which I try to inject commenting a little too early but we're good see you next time thank you foreign
