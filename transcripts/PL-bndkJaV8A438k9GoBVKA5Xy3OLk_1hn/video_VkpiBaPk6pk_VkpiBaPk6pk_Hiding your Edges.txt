hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about hiding seams in Geometry so I just used the term seam there's not really seam seams aren't a thing you know there's not an entity type called seams what I'm talking about is that line that can be in there between two surfaces that break them into two pieces sometime that's good because you want to put different materials on one section versus another something like that but sometimes through the modeling process you end up with one chunk connected to another chunk and it should be smooth but you got a line between them we're going to talk about how to clean that up we're going to look at three different instances one with just raw geometry one with groups and then another with components because how you deal with them might be different uh and we're going to take a look at that right now all right first one's first sad Captain Obvious all right so the first thing we got here is this is just raw geometry so I just have these faces if you're ever doing this this makes sense so I got this little uh little little mockup I'm doing for a tiny home kind of thing here uh looking at some windows I could put in and I got my roof section which would be built separately from my walls so I modeled it that way but now when I look at it I want to see my siding go top to bottom and in this case when it's just raw Jou like this if these two pieces are in plain I can it's just as simple as deleting or erasing those pieces that done I mean it's it's pretty simple I'm going to undo real quick and and comment on one thing if I turn on on my x-ray so we're going to go up here to view Edge style and turn on I'm sorry face style and hit x-ray see there's actually a face in here right there and then if I look up here same thing in between because the way I model this is separate pieces as soon as I get rid of one of these edges that face goes away see how that all disappeared same thing down here so that extra face right there get rid of that boom gone uh and with x-ray I actually come through here and get rid of those edges around the back too look at that that's that's efficient modeling right there that x-ray all right let's go ahead and turn we don't need that turn all right that looks pretty good so this is now one monolithic set of geometry right this is just one big hopefully solid piece if I ever wanted to like 3D print or something I could do that with this uh but yeah so I got rid of those pieces pretty easy if they're in line if they're not in line if one piece is angled off the other there's a chance when you erase that line it'll break it and then you'll have a big hole on the side of the model that happens if everything's in line though like this uh that should be good you should be good just erasing those let's talk about what happens when they groups right so this is how I would most likely model something like this even in a conceptual situation I would separate the floor from the walls from the roof so in this case if I want a nice smooth say say there's just one piece of side I want to look just like this top to bottom what i' have to do is go into this group and I want to go to view component edit and hide rest the model real quick so I just want to see this piece so what I could do is I could come in here and I could go to erase and I have my modifier Keys down at the bottom and what I want to do is actually want to hide these I I want I want to I want to make sure they don't show up so I'm going to turn on hit shift hold down shift and hit all four edges here so if I go look at that right now you don't have that edge there anymore I just have the surface so when I come back out here I what they're still there no they're not still there they actually disappeared on this piece but they didn't disappear on this piece so if I grab this piece I want do the same thing again shift erase Dr across each of these four sides and now when I come out look what happens oo nice and smooth let's do the same thing at the bottom because practice makes good at stuff I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to erase shift I just have to tap shift too since uh what 2020 or 2021 it's a toggle so you just tap shift once and that goes that uh and hide stays on then of course double click same thing here shift erase erase erase erase there we go so I got the same thing they are separate pieces still this can look kind of weird if I'm in here in walls and I'm messing around moning around with stuff and I see that this you know this line is missing it can it can be a little weird sometimes but uh again model for whatever you're actually planning to do so in this case if the thing that's important is this final look right here then it doesn't matter if it looks funny in here because I'm working on the model and I know it's supposed to be there so it's okay uh as long as it doesn't bother me as I'm modeling then having that hidden is going to be good because then I can just hop right back out here and everything look smooth all right so these were groups so each of these if I click in the point see group group group these were all just solid groups if I come over here I actually have a component so this is going to work a little bit different like I said working with a group versus a component primarily because so I have you see this Each corner of this table is a separate component if I double click into one of them even though I have hide rest of model turned on they stay here because this is not the rest of the model this is copies of the same instance I'm working on there's a separate hide for that so if I go back up into view component edit and turn on hide similar components then that goes away all right so a couple things I want to talk about about here so one thing what can happen in models like this is even if I go through and I do the same thing shift erase erase I get rid of all these edges like this what can happen sometimes is this face right here can bleed through so depending on how the Shadows are hitting sometimes as I'm working around here I'll still I'll get a flicker right along the edge where those two pieces meet so what I would do in something like this is probably hide this face as well and rather than using eraser like I just did I'm going to undo a couple times and get all my edges back instead of using eraser like I just did what I might do just to keep it simple is do a group select from The Edge that see now I've got the face and all the edges that make up that face selected but I can't just hit eraser and hide it what I can do though is come over to entty info and just toggle the eyeball off and then it goes away so it looks like this is a hole now it looks like I got a big hole in here but it's not it's still there it's just hidden I do the same thing over here um I know you're saying oh Aon you got it got this this cool uh 3D mouse so it's really easy to navigate to that side view it's pretty easy to just use orbit to slide over here too if you don't like that if you don't like getting into a spot where you can do a quick select like that or if you have more complex geometry you can also double click double click selects the face and all the edges that create that face to highlight and then I come over here and toggle all off so again now it looks it looks like I have a hole right looks like this is a problem but this is still a solid piece they're just hidden geometry when I come out here and see how that ties together so even though I have four pieces they all look the same and because they're component I can do stuff like uh grab grab this and maybe slide it over slide it up and again it's going to look uniform because as I'm moving that it's moving all four pieces because it is part of that component and even though it's a component I don't have to mess with I don't have to like tolerate those edges if I was taking this out to rendering of course it wouldn't matter edges don't show up outside of SketchUp but for the case of creating a drawing inside a SketchUp hiding those edges those seams between geometry can be super helpful and super easy and the nice thing too is if I'm in here working and I want to like select that edge or something like that all I have to do I don't have to unhide anything all I have to do go up to view go up and turn on hidden geometry and those will show up as dotted lines and I could grab that move that edge around just like I would any other geometry and then if I wanted to I leave it on too and I get my doted lines and I just toggle It Off by going to Hidden geometry I really I highly recommend putting a a shortcut key on hidden geometry it is one of the Hidden geometry and the other thing we use here was uh hyd address a model I recommend shortcut keys bound to both these commands as you're modeling sketch up this going to take you a lot save you a lot of time make it real quick and easy to do that kind of modeling and editing so there you go quick and easy way to uh hide those seams between groups components I should say it the right way components groups and raw geometry this of course is not necessary you could actually go through your entire modeling career and sketch up for years and years and years and never hide any geometry and just have those lines show up if that's cool with you that's cool with me you do your thing that's perfectly fine I A lot of times like to have my geometry cleaned up show smooth you know especially in in buildings buildings in particular because like uh uh I come from residential architecture and the outside where I have my my roof maybe a Gable is separate from the wall below because they're two different groups or two different components or whatever but I like to have my siding just be nice and clean across there without having that line and this is how I'd go about that if you like that video click like down on if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below let me know what you think of this tip if you use it if you use a variation of this there's a different way to do it or if you use it for a different kind of modeling or failing that you don't do this do you have another tip that you think would make a good video let us know in the comments down below we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you n
