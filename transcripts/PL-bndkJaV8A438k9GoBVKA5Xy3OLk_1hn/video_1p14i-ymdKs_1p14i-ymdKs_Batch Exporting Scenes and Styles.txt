hey everyone Eric here and today I want to share with you my process for automating the export of scenes directly out of SketchUp so when I say automating scenes I'm kind of referring to a term that some of you are familiar with it's called batch export so basically it's like I've got a bunch of scenes and I'm going to give you two different examples here in a minute of two different use cases or scenarios of why I might want to export a bunch of different scenes all at once so assuming that they share the same settings or properties like size and style then um this is kind of a cool way to do it so let's just get right into it I've got my model here um it's a model of a coffee shop and I've got some scenes set up so I want to just kind of show you a couple things really quick before we get right into exporting process so number one I've got all my scenes set up I've got one with everything turned on in this case just a roof plan or plan view with x-ray so I can kind of see through it got another one where it looks like I've got a section cut I can toggle that on and off not really important just letting you know that this is kind of me saving what I think is is you know the general views that I think tell the story of this little coffee shop that I built so again looking at the sort of section perspective elevation plan and axonometric so I'm done sort of setting up everything I'm done styling everything I like the way it looks and I want to export first thing you'll notice is when I've click back and forth between these scenes they go pretty quickly that's because I've turned off my scene animation so under model info and over here to animation I turn off by default I just disable this I know some people like to be able to see those if I turn that on and then I click between slides I click between say that you can see what it does is it actually moves the camera now that's a cool effect and sometimes you want that if you're doing a flyr or something like this but in this case I don't I'm just going to go and turn that off so that's what I've done the second thing I want to do is make sure that I'm starting on my left slide here my left scene because what I'm going to do is when it batch exports it's going to go kind of left to right just like you're reading a book so that's all I really needed to check was just make sure that I turned off that scene um those scene transitions so now the traditional way to do it if we're going to compare the process I would come over here to file export and in this case I'm going 2D Graphics so I want to go to PowerPoint or I want to go to InDesign or maybe I would send some into layout um I just want to grab an image of this so let's go I would name this one a axonometric or axo double check the size settings make sure I'm using my view size 1080p um thereabouts click okay and Export and there it is so if I check my file there's my export now I want to do that times 1 2 3 4 5 six however many I have here eight but I also do want to do this in a separate file so anytime I can speed the process up even even if it's just by five or six seconds and you times that by 20 or by 30 or by 50 or however many scenes you have in your model hey that could save a lot of time so let's try this different way I'm going to go file same thing export this time instead of going to 2D graphic I'm going to pop down here to animation now what you'll notice under options is that you get some different settings you do get the resolution so I can change that to a custom resolution or because it's thinks you're animating to a video well that's kind of what animation is set up for you can see that it's using these sort of HD or 720p resolution I'm going to leave it as the 1920 that's what I wanted anyway so what I want to do is also double check right here the frame rate so if you're doing an animation you would have something like 24 or even 30 frames per second as you transition from one scene to another but in this case actually I'm wanting to export the views to be used in presentation like an in design or a PowerPoint so I actually don't want multiple frames um there's no key framing so in this case all I want to do is do one frame per second and that means that each scene I have in my model will export to one static image on my drive so I'm going to go ahead and click this first one and I'm just going to call this batch export um scenes of course I can call this coffee shop model and call it whatever I want I'm just going to do this as my test and I'm going to click export and as it's going there you can see what's happening here on my drive it's exporting everything all at once so what I'm going to do is grab those I'm going to go ahead and open these up just to show you and there they are axo plan plan section uh perspective and of course going down the list and there they all are so pretty cool that I was able to get that many views out all at once and of course if I change something like if I toggle a tag on and off or I change my default Style it's as simple as just going back to the SketchUp model and the same thing if I wanted to replace all of those I would just go file export and do that process all over again and in just literally less than 30 seconds all of my scenes have been exported now that's uh that's this is where I wanted to give you an example of where if I had all the Styles and all the shadows and all the tags set per scene that would be really useful most this is most how most of us work is we get all of our scenes looking exactly the way we want but I did a video recently about exporting to sketch so basically exporting to something like Photoshop where I would draw over it in which case I actually it's less important about knowing where all my scenes are going to be and it's more important that I have different styles set up for each scene so in this case I've got my color by tag which represents the colors um associated with the tags in the model the organ the way I've organized it I have just black and light white line work which I always like to to have just a black and white model I have x-ray sometimes I'll use x-ray if I want to be able to kind of soften something or give some transparency or see through it it's just stylistically a cool option and then I've got my shadows and so what's cool about this is that these scenes they're all style but not camera dependent which means that the style is saved to the scene but the camera location is unchecked so I did that intentionally and the reason why is because anytime you save a view in this case I don't really want my section so let me make sure my style here does not reflect a section cut I'm not doing sections for this there you go so basically this is the opposite of what I just did I have no scenes I have no perspectives no plan views none of that stuff set but I have my Styles saved so the reason for doing this is that if I wanted to just kind of if I was doing going to send this to to photoshop or to procreate or something like that I could pick a camera angle that I wanted to use as my say my perspective camera twoo perspective I'm happy with that camera angle I come over here and I go file export animation same thing um check my options one frame per second no scene Transitions and whatever size I want 1080p is fine in this case I'm going to call this one perspective and this is going to be I'm going to render this in Photoshop so I'm going to say render and hit export so it's going to export now it's going to pick up this default camera this default style and because the camera was not saved in these scenes it's going to export all of that particular view so all the styles that I need to work in that particular view are now saved and the cool thing about that is because I don't have that camera saved if I go back to my default style and I want to pick a different perspective like I want to go for example inside the coffee shop maybe find a cool view where I'm looking inside as if I just stepped in and I'm going to place an order we'll call say that's good enough camera twoo perspective now in this case I didn't even save a scene I'm not even saving it to a scene I'm just going to go I don't have time I'm just going to do some loose sketches of course I could save this to a scene and store this camera angle to come back later the point is I'm just try to get something out of SketchUp fa really quick so I'm going to come over here export animation again and I'm going to say in this case this is perspective interior spell it out if I want and then hit export and same thing it's going to kick me all of those views with all of those different style settings all at the same time so if I grab that all the way I grab these um five all together and open them up and I have everything I need to go into compositing and start layering these together and start doing a collage or start doing a hand sketch or start doing whatever it is that I want to do or annotate if I'm going to put them in a booklet and I want to Mark you have a version that I want to mark up or one that I need something for selections if I'm going to sort of isolate or mask objects out so that's just a really fast way to do that so again um whether you are just exporting a bunch of scenes or exporting something stylistically um to composite or to render we've got both of those options this process has both of those options covered and in this case I'm just showing you in two different models but of course you can do this in the same model if you wanted to and save yourself some time so that's actually it for the batch export process I know I've covered this as a lesson in the past as part of like my sketch up to photoshop workflow but it doesn't have to be necessarily too Photoshop it doesn't have to be style dependent and that's why I wanted to show you it in two different ways you know so you can think about whether or not that um whether or not you want to lock that camera and have a bunch of scenes or whether you want to have a free floating camera and then have a bunch of styles and either way that b batch export process really simplifies um getting a bunch of content out of SketchUp and wherever you want to take it from there so speaking of from here I'm going to leave you with that and I'm going to say say thanks as always for tuning in and watching with us today hope you learn something new if you haven't tried this process at least go experiment with it just so you're familiar and you're comfortable with it and uh who knows when you're going to need it so don't forget to give us that thumbs up if you liked it uh subscribe if you haven't already and uh I'll say thank you on that note and see you next time [Music]
