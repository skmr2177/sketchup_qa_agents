hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around let's just model these examples uh just as a practice exercise so a couple weeks ago uh we released a video where I was showing mindsight Studios bevel extension and one of the comments was hey can you show us how you modeled some of the examples and so that's what we're going to do we do read your comments we do appreciate your suggestions please keep them coming now one thing I should note um I don't know if I gave Credit in that video some of these examples um I was looking at this channel pixel Fondo and this is not a SketchUp Channel this guy makes some pretty fun and engaging videos on plasticity Moto some other 3D modeling software but I think it's just kind of an interesting exercise to go out there look at various modeling techniques and softwares and see if you can replicate it in SketchUp so that's what I was doing and finding some of these examples from that said we should be a little cautious solids modeling and surface modeling SketchUp is a Surface modeler be careful in comparing them directly to each other they're very different um we can create some similar things but they're definitely not an Apples to Apples comparison so we're going to try and replicate it uh just keep that in mind it's it's it's not not always useful to directly compare software like that all that said let's jump in all right this first example should be fairly straightforward now as I model this I'm going to just uh talk this through from a high level not get into very uh detailed specifics um you can also see this circle uh right now has a radius of 8 ft I'm modeling at a big scale these are probably smaller pieces but as many of us know um modeling at a larger scale will help you with details so this um I'm going to draw a circle I'm not worried about accuracy or how big and I do want this to be let's say it's 48 s 48 sides offset this a little bit then find the center draw a line in the green Direction then red then back and then find an arc something like that then use a flip tool flip a copy of this about so that we mirror it and then I can delete what we don't need and that's the that's the the form we need now as I pull this up what we can see is that the the way that we created this did create all these segments so I may select these back edges and use my keyboard shortcut or a right click menu to weld these just so that it's clean when I pull this up all right triple click I'm going to group it and move a copy let me just move a copy a little bit vertically and then use the move tool to easily rotate this and flip it and that's that's what we need so I can select both of these objects and use the solid tools over here to create the intersection between them now for uh one of the things I like to run is tomtom's cleanup extension and so I'm just cleaning these uh and be cleaning all the models with kind of the same basic settings the main one here I want to smooth out angles um I think by default it's 30 I might change this to 15 just a smooth but there we go and if we wanted to add a bevel through the bevel extension I come in select this I'm going to run the bevel mindsight Studios bevel tool oh that looks awful let me undo that and try again and again that just we want to appreciate that um the tiny little Ledges that we're creating and breaking up here in SketchUp operate differently than a solids modeler um and we can still make it work for us in many cases but uh we just we have to keep that in mind in this case we have this Edge that's like working really close to where we broke this uh through um our our cylinder our opening here one of the things that we could do depending on how tight we need this shape to be we weren't very careful on you know how this was created but I could create for example I should be able to pull this surface out there we go to pull this out and that would give me enough room that the um the opening cut here would fall squarely within the a flat surface so if I did that then rotate it flipped it and ran the intersection then our results might be a little cleaner here because like I say this Falls within a a flat surface so it just depends on what you need if I try bring this out and we do we get a little bit better uh results so if I run clean up again that looks okay let's um jump into this next one now in this example again um how this was created by uh in some of the other software this was a series of I believe they took a cylinder and welded it together with a couple of blocks and then cut this shape out and then cut these cylinders out in when we look at a shape like this in SketchUp we would probably be like you know we would just create this shape first so let me find a top view turn perspective off and do that that's probably how we would go about creating this uh type of thing I think I'm still on 48 segments which should work fine and then create a little bit of a curve here and then over here again I'll find my center and draw and I'm snapping to these points just so that they they mesh nicely but again that's because we don't have a a specific accuracy we're trying to achieve here I can flip this from the top and then let's say cut that away flip this one to get the same here and and let's extend this now I want to be a little bit careful again we um getting multiple inference points so I don't want to snap to the wrong piece but that is how we might create this and this looks larger we be a little more careful same as before I could select various parts of this uh run the weld command if I wanted to clean it up a little bit but now I can turn perspective off and then we would come in and uh draw a half circle cut that away draw a half circle over here we could copy this surface back and then cut both away and then come in and we could either create a cylinder uh and use the solid tools to cut that away or we could do something like this and again copy it and even copy it over to here there's always lots of ways to do anything um we could have created this with more solid tools uh but didn't need to all right let's look at our last example if we look at this one basically we're going to create a shape like this and we're going to create a shape like this and then just use the solid tools to intersect them so let's start with the top shape and again I'm going to turn perspective off and draw something like that and then something like this and offset it the same amount then I will find that top end point in this case I'm not see how it it I'm not finding the top end point here so it's more sort of one of these and then I will mirror just that single line mirror copy based on the center point and Trace over that edge to tell SketchUp please fill in that surface now to do the inside why don't we take and we'll roughly I don't I don't know how how much that was let's say in this case let's make it two feet on each side and then draw an arc say from here to something like that and then from here we'll find that Center Point draw another Arc create that line and now that we've broken that surface we can mirror that whole surface again find by the center point here and it looks like I mirrored two of them let me undo that I'll make sure that that I'll give myself a little reference so select this flip it flip a copy perfect if all these edges work we should be able to erase these extra edges we don't need sometimes uh you probably experienced a skch up we have to do a little bit of uh finessing to get it to uh connect the surfaces but we're good so we can pull that up and again uh I've got these edges but let me just group this and run the cleanup extension and that's one now the other one we need is from the side so I'm going to look at this from the front and say what we want to do is something roughly like this and if I let me move this guy out of the way if I look at this in x-ray mode I I think I want this um this piece to start a little bit beyond the our our cylinder area here so something like that I'll select these use the off set tool offset them a little bit and create half of this I use the arc tool I can draw one arc tangent on both sides and I should be able to double click on these other Corners to replicate that same Arc and then if I use the flip command draw a line something like this and again draw an arc here and double click that will do it so let's pull that out make it a group I'll turn X-ray back off and turn perspective back on oops not Shadows let's move this now it looks like I made it a little too big so let's extend this up but that should do it and if you know if we want we adjust sort of where this Falls but let's take these two and intersect them and if we're not happy with those results of course we go back in and finesse the shapes that we created but that's the idea maybe I'll run cleanup maybe I'll run the bevel extension but that is a bit of how you might create some uh shapes like this some different forms just think about them like can we intersect different shapes together um what uh what tools would best create just some interesting shapes so like I say try it and uh see what you can do all right I know that was sort of fast and a little hectic but hopefully it gives you some ideas and again just go out there find other ideas uh other examples of what people are creating in other software and think how would I create that in SketchUp be careful again it's not an apple stles comparison in many cases but it's an interesting exercise to practice on uh and like I said this was um based on a comment so again please let us know your feedback your comments and your suggestions for other topics that we could cover in these Skill Builders uh we would love to have that uh feedback from you thank you all and as always please like And subscribe and we'll see you next time [Music]
