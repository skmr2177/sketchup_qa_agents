hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're want to talk about maintaining accuracy while modeling and SketchUp so we hear this kind of thing a lot that oh you know sketchup's great for conceptual modeling or just massing but not really for details or exact dimensions um the thing is SketchUp is as accurate as you need it to be so depending on the steps you take you can have insane accuracy like fractions of fractions of inches very very minute 0.0 1 in I don't know very small Dimensions but you do have to be intentional about it it's not going to automatically assume what you want and make things the right dimensions or the right accuracy you have to tell it how to do that and good news I'm going to show you how to do that right now let's hop in all right so I have this this model this is a a a 3D printed part that I created and you can see by Teddy's feet right here this is not a big piece right this is uh it's a couple inches wide it's it's not huge um I picked this because it does have a bunch of small little details on it and uh obviously this this is the kind of thing that I might run into if I'm I'm concerned about detail I want I want want these small details to be correct I want these accurate uh that sort of thing and they were there this was this printed perfectly absolutely perfectly um so I'm going to look at some some issues that people run into so I have started just my standard when I model in SketchUp 90% of the time I'm modeling modeling something architectural so the template I use for that the default is set for architectural units so to check what you're modeling you're going go to to window and go to model info that's going to pull up model info right here and the last tab right here is units we're going to talk about everything pretty much everything here on units so like I said this is my default is architectural and I have my architectural set to a 16th inch uh precision and then my area and volume are square in and then I have that set to4 inch square so this is how I do most of my modeling um again 16inch accuracy is just something I'm used to this is where where I came up doing design work was with accuracy of about a 16th of an inch you can always make that finer go up to a 64th of an inch or if that's too much you just go to a full solid inch not nothing more more uh finite or or detailed than that but this is where I do my most of my work this works great for architectural modeling if I'm going in modeling you know framing something or modeling a building or something along those lines this is the perfect setup if I get into something like this like what I have on my screen where I'm modeling these teeny tiny details I if we come look at let's look at some of this so This span across this opening is 516 this screw hole right here is an eighth of an inch so I'm looking at some pretty small details uh that's less than an eighth of an inch there so this would not be the template to use for this model I would definitely want to change so one of the things that people run into I'm going to say immediately and and complain about their lack of accuracy is they have something like this set when they should be using much smaller Dimensions so one of the things I would recommend is if you are doing something that requires a high level of detail is use something more like decimal switch from architectural to decimal you can still use inches but in this this case it's not going to round the nearest 16th of an inch it's going to actually give you whatever that number is you want so you can go one two three four five six decimal places past zero or you can always what I tend to do is when I go into to modeling is I will actually flip this over to millimeters and actually do most of my work in millimeters instead of putting in uh you know fraction or very very small inches so that's my number one thing that I'd recommend make sure you you have your measurement units set up to the Precision you need for the thing you're doing and this goes both ways too so if I am modeling a house don't Model A house to you know 0.000000001 inch um not because that's not a real thing but because I'm just going to advocate for people who frame houses most measures don't have those numbers on it so um if you are doing something like that you of course will want to flip back to something like architectural and have a realistic Dimension here um one of the other things that people run into with problems and and I know this is on by default is enable length snapping let me give you an example of how this hurts people so say I want to draw a line to this point right and I want to come over here I'm going to pick a point arbitrarily pick right here and I want to dra draw that back to here now the issue with enable length snapping is along this line if you watch my see my length down lower right corner watch as I move my mouse see how it's jumping at 11/16th at a time if I get in here close to this point that point is not the only Point possible there's also less than a 16th inch away there's another snap point so if you're not insanely conscious and watching very very closely to make sure you're hitting those points it's super easy for length snapping to grab that other point so some people go oh well I'll make that simple no problem I'm just going to come in here and make that a really small unit whoops now now no problem no that's actually a bigger problem because now your other snap points are really close to that point and it's even harder to find whether or not you're hitting that right so my recommendation is generally just to turn enable L snapping off off I know some people want to use that like a grid like it's always going to be like everything's going to be on this perfect grid but the fact is unless you are even more Vigilant about every start point and end point being on an endo length snapping is not going to help you out with that so there are certain very very general situations where I'm building with you know exact bricks exact dimensions everything is one foot by one foot by one foot or something along those lines where that might be helpful but generally speaking this is going to give you additional snap points which are not where you want them so here's what I'm talking about with length snapping off see this I don't have I'm not snapping I'm just moving moving along smoothly and then as soon as I get here jump I'm on the point or I'm off and there's no there's no no uh additional snap point that I accidentally hit to so that is definitely a thing you want to consider if you're working on maintaining accuracy and exact dimensions disable snap length snapping turn that off um same thing goes for angle units right here uh if you are doing a bunch of stuff where you're rotating things or or drawing arcs something like that um length angle snapping is kind of nice actually I use it because if if I'm rotating everything's probably going to be at 45 30° or 60° I don't want to do a whole lot of weird angles outside of that so for me this is kind of nice but if you're doing a bunch of stuff where you're going to you know I I need to snap to 15.9 degrees and not 15 you might want to consider turning angle snapping off there all right the final thing I want to throw out there for maintaining accuracy so if you do those things if you if you turn off length snapping you set to a dimension that or a unit type that makes sense for the size of model you're doing that's going to help a lot but every once in a while stuff still can get off you can sometimes depending on how if I go to snap to a point depending on The View that I'm looking at so if I'm looking right here it's going to be really easy to snap to that point if I'm like right here then all of a sudden I've got all these other points are showing up under here uh turning xray on says gives me a whole bunch of extra spots I can snap to so it's it's still possible to snap to points that aren't where you want and getting something off aaxis or in incorrect that sort of thing so one of the things I recommend if you're trying to maintain high level of accuracy is over here in Styles if I look at Styles go to the edit Tab and there in my my edges right here if I roll scroll down here all the way to the bottom the color is set to all the same if I switch that to by axis this is a really cool thing and it highlights all of the edges that are parallel to the main axes so if I'm modeling something that doesn't have a bunch of curves or or weird lines going off which you know frankly a lot of my models do conform to the red green or blue axes for their geometry this is great because it will show you anything that's off axis so my curves obviously fall off axis that makes sense um you can see I have a couple look at this right here this whole wall right here is not on axes on axis on a I forget which one's the plural so if I pull my line across here so the green axis is so this should actually be back here so I can grab this come in here grab this Edge move it back to here there you go see those lines turned green that means they're back on axis now so that is a great help so anytime you're working with geometry and you want to maintain and make sure everything is straight and flush I would recommend checking out color by axis so those are three tips working the right units working the right uh Precision of units take off length snapping I know it sounds like going to help you but you have to be twice as Vigilant with leg snapping on to make sure you don't hurt yourself and then check out color by axis so just a quick video to to mention a couple of those things and hopefully give examples realistic examples you can see how or why you might want to use that um it's of course there dep everybody uses SketchUp differently there's so many different things you could model with SketchUp so many ways you can model it that there's different solutions for different things that people model so uh not going to say that this is everybody conforms to this one needs a model the way that I do but those tips are going to help if you've ever had issues where you created a models and then you end up off on a dimension or or something's not quite right that should help you out if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment down below we want to hear if there's other tips like this that you use to maintain accuracy or if you have a general tip for SketchUp you think we should show in a video or if you run into problems and you would like us to make a video to help you out of it we'd like to hear that too like making these videos a lot we' like them even more they showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
