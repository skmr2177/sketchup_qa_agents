hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're look at the top five issues you might run into if you don't use groups and components in SketchUp so we've done a few videos before talking about why groups are important and the power of components with you know duplicating geometry that sort of thing but we want to do a video specifically on the problems you will run into not may you will run into these sooner or later if you don't put your geometry groups I know it's part of the appeal of SketchUp is you download it and you immediately start modeling you just put in lines edges faces Push Pull just start into it right away and it's super easy but what you do need to do is be intentional about grouping that geometry otherwise you're going to hit these issues and we're take a look what those issues are right now all right so we're starting right here with a couple of signs and for all intents and purposes they're the same but as soon as we start trying to like manipulate them or or interact with them we'll see the difference so if I pick right here you see that I have a group right here in fact if I double click I come in here and I'll have multiple groups so this one on the left is in groups if I come over here and pick something you see that face will just light up right there so I'm over here on the right side actually looking at a bunch of raw geometry so we are going to look at the difference and the the issues that you're going to run into modeling like this instead of like this so at the end of the day everything looks the same and well the reason it looks the same is because I modeled this in group and exploded it out for this example I don't know if I could have gotten to this level of geometry correctly without using groups along the way and that's because the first issue we run into which is sticky geometry so if I come in here and I hop in here I want to move one of these light bulbs for example click into my groups a couple times here's this one uh I'm going to go to view component edit and turn off hydr the model so I can see the whole model as I do this so if I grab this and I do go to move and I pick it up I can take it off here no problem easy you know uh the star let's go look at the star so if I pick the star I grab it I can slide it away from the rest of geometry no problem if I come over here we're going to come out of this group and I come over here and I'm going to grab that same light bulb well one of the light bulbs and I go to move it and I'm going to I get this thing happening right so not what I want in fact if I look at this all this geometry is stuck together so any place geometry touches other geometry if I try to move that I'm going to get this one is not even letting me move it because it's so uh there we go oh yep there we go see that that's what we call a horror show that's a mess if I try to move this that's going to cause geometry to overlap and just ew just ew that's what's going to happen there it's going to beat you so sticky geometry is the first thing sticky geometry is a great part of SketchUp and how it works when you bring two faces together they automatically connect but it's not always what you want if you want to maintain separate pieces you will have to group those pieces so that's number one is sticky geometry sticky geometry is great until you don't want to happen then it is kind of painful the second thing Point number two is organization in what I mean by organization is not just okay in here this is all just a bunch of faces but how do I actually have these fa these these items interact so right here like I said this is one piece so if I want to move this one piece I come in here to move I can grab this I move my whole sign around easy as anything right it goes beyond that because if I come in here I'm going to double click into this group and then like this is what I was saying is these lights then are in separate groups I actually have them in quadrants up here the welcome sign I have that as one big entity but if I double click in I have my neon where the the letters are is a separate one I have my letters themselves as a separate one the neon circles another group if I click in here I can see I actually have my geometry for the circle all of this is put into group inside of group inside of group so it makes it very easy to jump to the geometry I want some people go oh that's a whole lot of clicking to get down to the geometry yeah it's a couple extra clicks but it also prevents me from having to work to get this e and pull it off right because I can just double click into the group and I can grab that geometry it's right there it's simple to move around uh and that happens because I use nesting groups so it's a group inside of a group inside of a group and that happens obviously doesn't happen over here but it does happen as you start to use groups it just makes your model easier to work with in fact over here our outliner our outliner is going to actually show these groups and where everything is so here's my bulb group obviously because there's a bunch of bulbs in there and it's going to go through and actually control all that but none of this happens if you don't have anything in there so I could have been a little bit more intentional about my group names actually now that I'm in here I see that but this level of nesting does not and will not happen and here's my welcome group is the welcome up here and I can see where each of these pieces are the circles where the geometry inside the circles are that's all because this is nested as opposed to over here this isn't even showing up in the outliner because only groups and components show up so all of this is this over here I pick on that's all over here over here none of this shows up in outliner because none of this is in any kind of groups that's item number two item number three is geometry on tags so here's what I mean by that so let's go ahead and expand our tags window over here so again this kind of falls into organization as well but there's a specific issue related to tags uh if we look at this our our our A+ our star model over here if I start taking off some of these letters or I'm sorry letters some of these Tags I'm going to turn these tags off and you can see the pieces disappearing right turn the neon off turn my circles off turn my star off toggle my structure on and off and you can see see how it goes away this is because everything is put on tags and it's easy to get rid of pieces if you try to do that over here you can put geometry on the tags it is recommended again so we have a whole video I'll try to remember to put that in the description on the kind of problems that can happen when you have geometry on tags as opposed to groups on tags which is what you should be doing but this is the kind of thing you run into so I can come in and put geometry on tags and then I can try to make stuff disappear so I put some geometry onto there um so I didn't it wasn't complete it's also difficult to try to grab exact faces and edges when they're not in groups and and tag them um but it does cause other problems this is why this is a mess turning things on and off random geometry the way to do this is to put everything modeled on tags raw geometry always on tags and then as you group stuff added to the tags it's going to make it easier cleaner to work with you're not going to have stuff like this where I have these random faces laying around because it's so hard to select everything but it actually leads right into another reason why it's so important to group geometry which is our fourth point so number four this is geometry merging with unseen other geometry invisible geometry so let's say for whatever reason I want to break apart this the top section of that structure piece right there so I grab a rectangle and I go okay so I'm going to go from here to uh here I want to draw a rectangle right here I'm going to get this message this message is especially startling if you're very new to SketchUp your recent operation has caused visible geometry to merge with existing geometry that is hidden the only option you have is okay there is no undraw my geometry there is no make my geometry visible again all I can hit is okay and I don't know exactly what happened right now but I know something happened to the geometry just tried to draw and some portion of it didn't show up but some portion did and I don't know why this is what happens when you draw on top of geometry that is on another tag so right here what's happening is if I turn this on again this this face right here was intersected with when I drew my rectangle on top of it so that face merged and all I got were the two new edges that were created as a result of that drawing that's confusing that's why you should put it in groups basically if boil it all down to this will be way less confusing to model if I remember to group things I'm going to undo a couple times because I don't want whatever I just did there to be and let's go look over here real quick all right so similarly I have geometry here that's turned off and let's say if for whatever reason I wanted to come in here and I'm going to draw another rectangle here I'm going draw it on this face like like this uh there we go I'm just going to draw a rectangle right like that it just draws a rectangle so even though that geometry directly overlaps this geometry it doesn't care because this geometry that's in my structure piece the the what's in here in this blue section is part of a group so I can draw geometry on top of other geometry all day and it's going to be okay with it SketchUp doesn't care if I do that as long as they are in separate groups so you can't accidentally merge with other geometry if that geometry is in a group so even if it's hidden even if I can't see it I still can't accidentally merge with it all right let's look at one more point point number five is modeling duplicating geometry without components that is a painful process modeling is not so bad you can use the stamp tool you can use the array tool to get some stuff in here but let's say for whatever reason I come in and I decide oh you know what's supposed to have happened right here when I did this this was supposed to be gold so I'm going to grab uh my paint bucket I'm going to sample this color and put right here done done right they're all gold now no problem piece of cake over here guess what I'm going to have to do here I'm going to come over here I'm going to sample this and I'm going to paint here then I'm going to paint here then I'm going to paint here there's a hundred of these little extruded circles around here and I'm going to have to swing around my model and find the best way to see each one of these and this is not difficult this is not hard to do but it is timec consuming so even if I can you know that's that's that's like a minute and a half if I can click each one in about a second as opposed to a single click over here with components so leveraging the power of components is a huge part of properly using groups and components and preventing you from having to do this kind of mind numbing work because you know this is the way SketchUp was built it was built to use components so you don't ever have to manipulate those repeating members ever so definitely a big point there with not having to mess with those components all right so quick rundown those Five Points again first one sticky geometry number one it's the biggest thing sticky geometry you stop items from sck sticking together by putting them in groups so so important number two organization put groups inside of groups inside of groups Mak them easier to get to and then you can also use the outliner number three geometry on tags if you put geometry on tags it will always cause problems check the video out link down below it's an older one but the it's still there it's still the way it works uh much easier to do it the right way and put groups on tags number three you don't have to worry about G ometry merging with invisible geometry because it's in groups you don't have to worry about it it's easy uh and number five duplicating geometry is automatic with components you won't run into any of these issues if as you finish modeling I always think of grouping as a thing when I group a thing that is by itself and I want to just be itself I put it in a group so start modeling stop put it in a group start moding X piece stop put it in a group and just move on through your mod that way you may end up with a bunch of groups oh I got 50 groups in this model that's not bad that's an okay thing it's better to have a 100 groups in your model than to have thousands of random faces and edges just floating around interacting with each other much cleaner way to model better way to model and the way you're supposed to model in SketchUp if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos around here each and every week and you be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you been bitten by this have you have you been a random geometry modeler and seen the light and come to groups or if you haven't what else do you need what other arguments do you need to have qued in order is that the right word qu qued squashed what else do I got to say to convince you that you should be using groups let me know down below and if you have an idea that you think would make a cool video that we haven't done before maybe something we have touched on you think we should go deep deer let me know about that too we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
