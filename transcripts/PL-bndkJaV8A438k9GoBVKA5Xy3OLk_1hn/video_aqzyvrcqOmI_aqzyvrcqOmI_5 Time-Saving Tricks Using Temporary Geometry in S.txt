hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about temporary reference geometry so I did a video a little while back talking about guides and the nice thing about guides is they let you put reference geometry or inferable geometry wherever you want and it never breaks other planes or edges or anything like that and it's great it really is awesome but there's some times where maybe you don't have all the information to get the Guide exactly where you want it or it's easier to draw temporary geometry so anyhow I have a couple of examples of situations where it's easier to draw temporary geometry and reference it rather than using guides and how to do that without messing up your model so let's take a look at that right now all right so I have this little uh this little model right here um and I'm going to go ahead and draw this in so uh first thing is this is this is so far away from being at scale um but I'm going to draw the thing that we have here it's a plate and you see the plate is uh 1 and A4 by 1 and a/4 so I'm just going to start by drawing a rectangle I'm going say 1.25 comma 1.25 5 I did it wrong all right let's try again 1.25 comma 1.25 there we go and you can see this is obviously not the right size so I'm going to go ahead and just scale that way down and then we'll slide that over here and zoom on in Okay cool so there there's my plate um now it does have thickness to it but if I'm modeling something that has holes in it I will always try to model the geometry first while it's flat then take the holes out and then push pull it up otherwise if I put depth to it first then I have to put the holes on there and then I have to push pull each one down so by pulling up the plate with holes already in it I do one push pull otherwise I'm do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 so going to save myself some time there all right now I have two sets of holes drilled in this plate one is at these four corners and you see they're 1516 apart both sides so I'm going to level with you guys and any of you watch my live streams you probably already caught this I'm not a good Mather math is not my it's not my thing it's not the thing I excel at so I could break this down and do the math and figure out what 15 16 away from one and a quarter is and then divide that in half to figure out how far each of these are in but in the time it would take me to do that I could draw a piece of reference geometry that I could then just drop exactly where it needs to be so all I have to do right now is go grab a rectangle come about where I think that's supposed to be start draging it down and then just type in 1516 comma 1516 and then enter so that gives me a rectangle I don't know that it's where I need to be but I know it's the right size so what I can do now is Select it and grab a midpoint here and drag it this direction to the midpoint there and then same thing drag it vertically and all I'm doing is I'm dragging along the green axis and then holding down shift and then just kind of come up here till I hit that midpoint might have to actually zoom in here there it is so now I know for a fact that these four corn are exactly where I need my circles to be so what I could do is I could come in right now and draw a circle right here and I'm just going to I don't know I'm going to yeah 11/16th is fine and then I could just put a circle at Each corner like this I'm going to hit an issue right here my issue now is that this circle is now two pieces because the square was in the way so I'm gonna back up a couple steps I'm gonna grab my rectangle I'm gonna drop it over here I'm going to take this piece right here my geometry I want to work in and I'm going to make it a group so now that means my geometry is separate from any other reference geometry so now when I bring this over and I go snap to the middle if I double click into my my thing right here I can see my reference geometry is grayed out so now when I come make my circles circle circle circle circle these at this is just a circle now and that reference geometry doesn't mess with it at all so I can now grab this I double click on this rectangle here delete it there we go good to go I'm going to do the same thing right now for this right here so I have a circle here that's saying you know I have a circle of circles that go around this plate and they are it is 3 and a/4 in across so what I could do instead again keeping this still in its group that's going to protect it from me goofing up and drawing any geometry where it shouldn't be I can inference this direction I can inference this Direction find the middle and I could pull that up so that this is the diameter is 3/4 of an inch so I'd actually just want to pull it up half that which would be 38 so type 38 hit enter and there we go now that's nice but I could actually make this even easier on myself so I know that this is 3/4 out to out so 38 and there's 1 2 3 4 five six holes that going get drilled on that Dimension so I can save myself a little bit of work by rather than drawing a circle drawing a polygon with six sides so I'll do the same thing I'll inference to the middle I'll start pulling that up I'll go up 38 and what I've done now is I've created a point where each of those circles needs to go see that see how it matches so now same thing I just come in here I draw a circle right here and then I'm going to save myself a little time I'm going to grab this one I'm going to hit option option to get into stamp click in the middle and then just click here here here here and here and if I come out here I can just get rid of that oops I got the rid of the face there we go there we go now now that I'm done with all that in ing I can go ahead and explode this piece and remember how I was saying it was easier to put all these holes into the plate beforeand before I I push pull well here's the secret to that I'm going to select the plate just the face not the edges not the circles just this middle piece I'm going hit move and then turn on my option to copy and copy it over here look what gets copied over just this piece which I can then push up to a quarter inch and not all these circles otherwise what I have to do is I'd have to go individually delete select delete select delete select delete select delete select delete which isn't terrible that was not horrible it's not the end of the world to have to do that but I did that and then one push pull two steps rather than you know those extra 12 so there you go uh the big part here like I say is that inferencing geometry if you don't have the ability to pull guides off and you don't want to break your geometry just group your initial geometry draw your inference geometry over it reference it and then delete it so we could probably classify this one as ways Aaron has figured out how to be lazy and not do math and that's fine um this is also one of those things where uh you know when I'm modeling naturally and going along I don't think about this if I stop step back and go what's the most efficient way to model uh this is the kind of stuff that comes up so I'm getting you the benefit of my doing this the harder way multiple times and then bringing this back so uh yeah so something to think about if you do have inference geometry that doesn't work immediately with guides or if it's like on a circle or because there is no Circle guide there is no hexagon guide you can't do that sort of thing with guides so using those other shapes for inferencing uh really helpful but something you might not hit if you're you know only depending on guides so if you like that video go ahead and click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe more importantly though leave us a comment down below let us know if you have a different hack that you use for getting inferencing and sketch up or if there's a different tool you use maybe in an unconventional way we'd love to hear it and if we like it enough we might make a video out of it we like making these videos a lot but we'd like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you
