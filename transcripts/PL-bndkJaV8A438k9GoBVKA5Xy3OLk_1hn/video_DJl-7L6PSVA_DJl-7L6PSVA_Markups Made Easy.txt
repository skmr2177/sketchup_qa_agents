hey everybody Eric here today I want to share with you a quick and easy way to add annotations or markups directly into your SketchUp model okay so the first question to ask ourselves is why might we need to add markups straight into SketchUp and I think the obvious answer is that we can always do a screen capture we can always then Mark it up and then send something as a 2d JPEG but like everything sketchup's ability to retain information in 3D to be able to rotate around use scenes that's going to be really helpful because imagine working collaboratively where we have multiple people and you need to say to somebody hey this needs to go here now you might not be the one making that change or you might not want to make that change but you can make that suggestion and it's really cool to be able to go in the model make a markup and then let the designer or the modeler make those changes that you want to see and then also be able to track them again right there in your model so I'm going to show you how to do that using a new feature in 2023 called overlays so let's go ahead and just get to it so I've got my model here you might recognize this if you took our campus course on Commercial Interiors then you've probably seen this hopefully build this yourself um in this case I'm just using it as an example let's pretend like this model is ready to be reviewed by our design teams that's what I want to do here I want to just say okay take a review let me know your thoughts don't make the changes yet just mark it up and then as the designer I'll go in and make those changes myself so first thing I want to do is explain a little bit of information about overlays if you don't know what they are it's a little bit technical because it's meant for the developers actually it's part of the back end so I'm going to click over here on window overlays again this is new to 2023 so if you're using an older version you're not going to get this so now that I've got this overlays panel here you can see what it does is it tells you which extensions use overlays so in a way overlays are native to SketchUp but what they're doing is they're allowing you to add information to extensions so it's like it's like being able to run the extension and be able to display information while you're modeling so it's kind of like expanding the capabilities of what we're already doing so there's a little bit more information to say about how and why and some of the advantages of working with overlays but that's not the core Point that's just kind of the information I want to kind of explain because really what we want to do is annotate our model if you're not sure where to get these extensions that use overlays you can click discover more I'm going to close that I don't need that and right now there's only a few out but I can see this being used more and more as developers really understand the potential to be able to display more information while you're modeling so that therefore you're just you know you're expanding again the capabilities of what we're already doing so I'm treating this as kind of a native SketchUp tool rather than an extension because a little bit like if you come up over here to Tool palettes we've got solid tools a lot of people don't think of those as sort of your core tools because they're not in the main toolbar sometimes people think sandbox kind of functions a little bit like an extension right but it kind of free floats in its own little world well that's the way I'm kind of treating annotations so once you've installed the annotations extension you can come up over here to draw and then under annotations we've got two kinds of annotations to choose from we can do model annotations which put the line work or the feedback right in the model or we can do screen annotations and I'll show you the difference between them let's start with model annotations if I wanted to draw something let me just kind of pan around I'll try not to get stuck in a wall or call them but I'm just going to kind of pan around and let's just say for example this pool table it needs to shift over for some reason I mean it's perfectly centered but maybe what we need to do or maybe the tile on the ground needs to edit so we want to do is come over here and make an annotation I'm just going to draw it with my mouse and I'm just going to kind of draw that area and I say this tile you know we've got to get rid of this tile we actually need to bring this wood over here so we're going to lose that tile and we're going to replace that with wood now the cool thing here is if I rotate around you can see what happened it's kind of like a visual trick it looked like I drew straight across but what it did is it The annotation recognizes the geometry and it goes up and over it now I can't select The annotation itself The annotation is an overlay so it's just being displayed it's not actually creating any geometry in the model it's not going to make your model heavy or anything like that but here's the the the thing if I come back over here to perspective my perspective that I started at you can see that that annotation that I drew was keyed to a seam so it doesn't really make sense to view it from over here what I might want to do instead is come over here first so before I draw The annotation so before I make The annotation um actually I'm just going to come up here I'm going to just clear those annotations erase annotations so I'm just going to clear those out depending on how many I have I can erase them one at a time here having trouble getting that one but that's okay just zoom in fix that so in this case what I would want to do is probably set up a scene first and maybe that's going to be called something like markup or annotations or whatever you want to call it comments doesn't matter so now when I draw annotations model annotations so now if I was to sit there and say no that needs to go away I'm going to cut that out that's gone I want to make sure that that's replaced with wood now if I come over here and I pop back to my previous scene it disappears those annotations aren't there anymore so when I come in my markup scene there they are and the nice thing about that is that because of that perspective it's actually really important that you tie it to a scene you don't have to but it kind of works that way the other thing reason why you want to mark up a scene a separate scene rather than doing it on its own is because in this case you saw me when I wanted to do it again I went to up here to draw annotations erase but it doesn't erase all of them it lets you choose which ones you want to erase so in that case I can erase the whole boundary I'm going to undo that if I want to get rid of if I had a bunch of annotations I could actually come over here and just delete the scene so if I delete that scene click yes I want to get rid of that what it's going to do is it's going to get rid of that scene and then therefore all the annotations with it are gone so let me show you the one more this is pretty simple extension so I mean that's pretty much most of it but there's one more option you can do which is called screen annotations so you know the way that I just did that did it on the floor and over the pool table and it kind of went up and over the pool table like that because it's actually drawing on the geometry in this case if I wanted to do something like like I'll just do it from here instead of just creating a new scene if I want to do something like that and I say no we got to get rid of the pool table unfortunately it's not in our budget we want to get rid of this tile we're not going to need that anymore and we want to put this wood over here now when I rotate in this case Watch What Happens this time if I zoom in and rotate you can see that I've lost the it's no longer tied to the geometry it's actually tied to the screen so it floats now that works almost better for like if you're doing call outs if you wanted to put something like a note that floats in which case it's actually kind of independent of the geometry so you can use these two together if I go back to my perspective Lounge there it is now I didn't create a new scene so now it's tied to this scene so I can either delete this scene or I can go and erase them manually I'm just going to go ahead and come back over here since I didn't create a new scene I'm just going to erase those annotations don't really need those I was just for this demo here and that last one there we go now we're back so that was pretty quick a pretty quick um kind of a overview of not just overlays like kind of what an overlay is and how it works and why it's Unique to 2023 right because that this actually technology came from the iPad app some people probably are thinking well you know that's cool that you've got an iPad app but I'm a desktop user but the now that we have the two of those when we learn something when something works really well on the iPad we can actually take that feedback we can take those tools and incorporate them that's what's happening here it started as an iPad drawing tool because you're using the pen and you're able to draw right on the screen and we said hey this is really useful actually we're going to bring that in in 2023 into the desktop of the pro or desktop version of the app so that's pretty cool that there's this feedback loop now that the two of them are actually getting Tighter and Tighter more integrated so whether use the iPad app and you do it that way or whether you're doing it on the desktop app now you don't need to do a screenshot and go to something like Photoshop you can just make your annotations right there in the model share those with other other people get those changes and that feedback Incorporated and you know keep going with your design so I want to say that's it thanks for watching don't forget to share subscribe comment and like and I'll say comment twice because I read these comments below um I'll interact with you I'll respond to you have you used this feature had to use it in your firm or personal work let me know give it I'd learn from you guys as much as I want to pass my knowledge on I want to learn also from people who actually do use this feature day to day if you haven't give it a try it's super easy it's super fun to play with and you know we'll go from there so I'll say thanks there and see you next time foreign foreign
