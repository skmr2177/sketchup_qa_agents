hey guys I'm Aaron and today I got some tips and tricks for the select [Music] tool yeah I know select tool seems awful foundational pretty simple right too simple even but there is some amazing parts inside of some amazing I don't I don't even know what to call them trip Tri trips that's a combination of tips and tricks which is trips uh but no there's some cool stuff inside of select that helps you to get the pieces you need highlighted so select itself is pretty simple right it's an arrow key you click on something it highlights um but I want to go a little bit beyond that and I think pretty quickly we can I can give you five six seven tips on getting more out of Select let's take a look okay so I'm in select right now and select the way select works of course is pretty simple if I move over thing and I click the left Mouse button it highlights it selected so when I'm looking at geometry if I click on a face the face highlights when I click if I go over an edge click highlights when I click and that's pretty much all there is to it it's it's very easy of course if I go over a phase and double click it it will click and select the face but it also selects all the edges that Define that face similarly if I double click on an edge it will select all the faces that connect to that edge so something to think about single click highlights one double click selects everything connected and then of course Triple click so 1 two 3 will select all connected geometry so it's not all the geometry in the entire model you can see that uh Teddy didn't get get highlighted my uh cylinder didn't get highlighted but it did highlight everything was connected to this box now if I have something grouped and I pick one it highlights the whole group unlike raw geometry double clicking will actually open the group and now I'm inside the group clicking outside will of course close the group so double click once you're in here then it works the same as before double click will select all select or connected geometry triple click will select everything um something else to note real quick right here so right here on the sides of my cylinder are smooth if I click right here it selects that whole face now if I go up to view and I say show hidden geometry Watch What Happens now when I come in here and I click one of these it's going to select just that one face if hidden geometry is turned on if hidden geometry is not turned on then smoothed surfaces are selected all at once just like they look like they should be so couple notes on the the basics single click SEC double click and group and hidden all right let's zoom out here a little bit uh here's a bunch of things so if I want to select a group of things I can click and drag select to get a select window left to right gets a solid window right to left gets a dotted window the solid window will select anything that is totally within the window when I release so you can see here the edge of my window hits three different cylinders when I release the cylinders that were hit are not selected now if I drag the other direction so windows in the same spot those three will be selected because of that dashed window so pretty pretty simple but every once in a while this bites even me where I go Oh Why didn't it get oh because I didn't quite pull it open big enough there is also another way to select I'm in the default select right here but if I hit the little drop down arrow right here I can choose lasso select and lasso select will let me just draw on the screen and pick only the items I want like that so same thing it does uh I do have a similar function right there when as I select see the the line that connects my cursor back to the first dot how it's dashed right here and if I go this way I come back over itself see how I turned it into a dash line there so it does take a little bit of playing with so this way it's only going to get those ones if I come the opposite direction whoops opposite direction now I have a dash line so now any of these that I touch are going to get highlighted um same functionality as the as the selection window but uh it depends if you're going clockwise or counterclockwise all right going back to normal select of course I do want to talk about modifier keys so modifiers are down at the bottom so depending on your operating system the actual key you use is going to be different so I'm on Mac so it is showing these keys because on Mac if you look it down here when you're on Windows you will actually see different keys I don't read these out anymore because it causes confusion people are looking for a button on their keyboard that doesn't exist just look down look that's all you got to do what button is do I use to add look down and the fact is just just hold these down so I'm going to go to my my add/subtract and I hold down that modifier key I get a little plus minus this means if I click something that's not highlighted it will highlight if I click something that is highlighted it will DEH highlight so the plus minus is just a select toggle if I hit the next one it says just add if I hold down that key then this only puts new items in so if I click on something that's already highlighted it can't get it can't get more selected it can only get selected once right and then of course the last one is a modifier for subtract it's two keys you hold those two keys down on anything you click on will get removed these can be used in conjunction with the select Windows 2 because I can hold down the the subtract window or subtract modifiers and then anything I drag over will be deselected easy way to get Precision selection but let's talk about this is easy these are groups let's talk about raw geometry I have a simple example of some raw geometry right here a little box with a Target shape drawn on it um let's say I want to select I double clicked on this this ring right here but I don't want the edges I just want the face so what I might be able to do is use the plus minus or just minus selector to turn this off and turn this oh no look what happened I have my uh ring right here is broken that means in order to click here I'm going to click whatever I don't remember 24 48 times I have to go all the way around and turn all that off what do I do well here's a way I can combine all the things we've talked about and make this simple so if I have minus so I still my my I'm holding down my modifier keys for minus if I double click on this third ring right here it will deselect the ring and any edges that connect to it so to turn off all these edges around this this ring right here all I have to do is minus double click this and they get turned off now I'm just here same thing works this works with with select Windows this works with uh you know well I was going to say triple click but triple click is going to turn all on or turn all off so that really doesn't help too much but it helps you make it easy to select specific geometry so now if I had these selected and I wanted to switch it I wanted to actually get the other two I do have an option that I can do if I right click on selected geometry and I go to select right here I have this invert selection which is kind of a cool way to flip what is highlighted so if I wanted everything highlighted except for let's say let's let's say I didn't want these two right here I could rightclick select invert selection say I'm going to go in and paint it or something right I want to paint everything red or white except for these two rings I can do that selection real quick the thing to remember is that select is contextual so everything in context that wasn't highlighted before is now highlighted and if I right click and I say select invert selection again it goes back the other way and it's everything like I said it is contextual so if I come in here and I do this and right click select invert selection it only it's not going to select all the stuff that's out of context but it is going to select everything that's in context that was not previous selected previously selected all right the other thing that I I want to mention real quick uh you saw me right click and bring up that select menu this is native this used to be something that we would go to an extension for this is part of it and I can actually come in here and I can do things like I can say um deselect all my edges so now I have just faces highlighted or I could do the opposite I could go to select and I could say deselect faces give me just my edges that make up all this geometry um there's some good extension or or some good options in there what are the bounding order the outside edges connected edges select everything connected everything on the same tag is a great one everything with the same material that's a great one if you do spend time putting materials on to help you sort or view data then you can actually highlight it all at once which is pretty cool so some good options in there in select uh and again like like so what I really wanted to point out with this is Select is not just you know pick a thing or hold down shift and pick multiple things select really gives you the ability to specifically get Geometry highlighted which makes a lot of times easier to edit that geometry later on so when you're using extension or you're going to move stuff you can pick out just a pieces you want you don't have to go through you don't you shouldn't be doing things like this if you ever find yourself doing this to select geometry something has gone wrong and you need to come back and watch this video and remind yourself what you should be doing because this is not a good use of your time so hopefully you likeed that video and hopefully it helped you out a little bit if you are hunting pecking kind of selector I get it it's easy and it's that's kind of a thing you learn but I would challenge you to try to use some of those modifier keys or some of those different rightclick menus to simplify and make your life easier because that's this what happened over here this is just taking years off your life this isn't helping anything you're not proing anything by clicking this like this don't do it if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos around here each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment down below uh do you like these tips tips and trick videos you like when we dive into native tools and go deep uh or would you rather see more modeling videos let us know we like making these videos a lot like me them more and showing something you want to see thank you
