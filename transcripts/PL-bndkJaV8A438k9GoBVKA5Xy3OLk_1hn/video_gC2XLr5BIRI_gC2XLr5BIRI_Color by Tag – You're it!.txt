hey everybody this is Eric in this week's level up SketchUp video I want to take a deeper dive and explore some of the useful features that color by tag provides [Music] so I don't know about you but I use color by tag mode in different ways for different reasons but pretty much all the time and I kind of feel like people think about it as if it's like something special that you only use it for certain things but I use it pretty much regularly and mostly for model organization but also to do sort of look at Material Alternatives so I want to kind of explore those two features that you may not already be doing and explain why that's going to help speed up your process and your workflow so let's go ahead and get to it so I've got a little house here I downloaded from the 3D warehouse and it's the materials that were in there weren't good so I just wiped it out and this is for me to kind of think about part of the process when I download stuff from 3D Warehouse is I kind of got it and I kind of rebuild it so I really think about almost like starting over from scratch a little bit so that's just kind of the context that's why I don't have any materials in this but since we're going to be overriding them anyway maybe that doesn't really matter I'm going to start by expanding my tags panel in order to be able to get to the color by tag feature so if I click these little three tags next to each other or just hover over it you'll see that it says color by tag if I click that right now I just have them all on the same color and that's to sort of prove the point that by default SketchUp just kind of assigns random colors you might see a dark green or dark brown but it'll also repeat colors so you might see several Blues now that's not really helpful so you can see that I don't know what what's on what because the colors are all the same so the first thing I want to do is whenever I get a model is not only do I re-tag I set up the tags the way that I want them but I also apply these different colors so that I know what's on what tag so for example it doesn't matter in this case what the colors are I'm just going to pick random colors what is important is that the colors are all different from each other I don't want to have um I don't want to have like three blacks or three oranges or something like that it doesn't matter again in Plants I'm making plants green but plants can be purple as long as they differentiate each other so I'm going through here um the wall slats what color have I not used maybe a darker purple and lastly the wall Stone which is sort of the main wall color I don't know do I have yellow I don't think so I'm going to go with yellow so it looks funky but that's okay so from here what's really cool about this is that oh you know for my untagged actually I'm going to go ahead and make this this sort of bright pink that's to me like this warning color is using this pink and I'll show you why in a second so from here I can look at this and say okay everything's on the right tag wait except for if I look here my concrete color is pink and I can see that some of these embedded components for these window components in the garage did not get carried over did not get caught so right there I can tell that there's like a warning saying hey get this on the glazing tack so I'll go into that component double click in there select the glazing and if you're old school like me you can come over here and move it from the concrete to the glazing but let me go ahead and undo that because with the latest versions of SketchUp we've got this little great tag tool here so in this case what I'll do is Select glaze you'll notice I'm not making it so that my this is not the current layer I'll always keep that as the untagged layer it's just selected and then I can click over here in my tag icon and just click once and again that's really helpful if I need to do five or six or seven things using that little assign tag tool is really helpful I know there's some other things that need to get fixed but for the most part I'm really just looking at it from this front view so that's kind of what I'm focusing on here so I've set up a scene where I've created a style my I've saved my color by tag to a style and there it is I can switch back and forth I can start to assign materials if I want to or I can start to fix the model or add more Entourage for example if I come in here and I just want to throw in some people um just to kind of get a sense of the composition or maybe a story that I want to tell one thing here I just dropped those in and by default they should be untagged which is good habit is to keep it untagged until you're ready to tag it in this case I click on my whether I click here up here in my tags or whether I click on my saved scene which has that style all of a sudden that hot pink that sort of hot pink warning says hey those two things have been left untagged make sure to select both of them and whichever way you want to do it put those onto the right tag and then you'll see that their color changes instantly which is perfect that's exactly the way that I want to use this it helps keep me organized the other thing this does I just drop this in from my library but if you're ever importing things from again from 3D Warehouse you're going to find some stray tags come in with it and this is a great way to kind of warn you hey if that color changes if you're checking it regularly that means that a tag came in with maybe something that you imported so just make sure to get that as soon as you can and to the right tag so if you do rendering too you'll notice that this is a really great process because it tells you what not only what things are tagged but they're tagged by material so that I can go assign my rendering glass to all of this so again if you're rendering or even if you're just if you're not rendering it's just kind of a good habit to get into staying organized and keeping everything on the right tag so that's kind of the primary use and I think that's pretty expected a lot of people know that but one thing I was in a conference and somebody asked me about changing the colors not to colors but materials so the next thing I want to talk about is actually not using solid colors so much now that was easy for me to see very quickly what needed to be reassigned or which was on what tag but this actually also works as a way to override the materials in the model and I say materials as in textures so right now if I go back to my default view I wiped all the textures that came out so in this case I could go in I could go into all these subgroups come in here as you know find um let's see if this is a concrete maybe I'll find um some concrete where's my concrete asphalt and concrete again apply that now up that was only in that group come in apply that now depending on how the model is set up or organized or grouped that could take a little bit of time and you don't want to explode everything because then you're going to lose you know you're going to lose all your groups and things like that so again if I want to I can go in and paint everything individually or I can come back to this same color by tag mode but this time under concrete instead of using this kind of random purple color that I assigned I can just click concrete material and click ok and now my concrete and my color override is showing a concrete material so same thing if I want to go to my wall Stone now it doesn't have to be Stone necessarily it can also be concrete or just and then if I go to my glazing in this case I'd want to come over to Glass and mirrors and I could pick any of these colors I'm just going to pick kind of a transparent gray and all of a sudden you can see that that's transparent the next thing I'm just going to finish this up just because I want to make sure that I've done it justice the roof I'm going to come over here to maybe a wood color and click ok just so that I have a dark roof and what else the garage door needs something which is what I'm calling wall slat maybe something nice and light to sort of contrast that and lastly the plant color come over here to landscape materials and find something that looks like a nice plant material or vegetation that one looks good and click that and that's really cool because then that way if I want to just check this and say hey parquet flooring maybe wasn't the best idea for that wood roof I can just click on that roof one again come over here and say well what about like a wood deck material that maybe wasn't the right move either so I'm just going to kind of keep trying different things and the nice thing about this is that is that because it's overriding the whole thing it's overwriting everything on that tag so that I don't have to go in and like I said go into that group paste that material find out I don't like it go in and remove it and repaste it this is maybe a good way to do some really quick material Alternatives in this case I'm still not sort of getting the right material on my roof and I'll say you know what that's close enough I'm going to go ahead and go with that so again the default there is no materials assigned to the model itself yet I can start to do that once I've figured it out or I can just overwrite it and using this setting too I've noticed somebody who taught me uh this at a conference they said yeah I use the materials I use this as a template because they use does cabinets a lot so what what he does is he goes in and he assigns all the materials to his model and then whenever he models he just puts everything on the same tags so all every time he brings a new model in it auto assigns materials so I'm not going to do that here because I think you understand the concept if I bring in another model as long as I have the geometry assigned to the same tag names then the materials will automatically populate which I don't know I mean I think that's a pretty cool feature so hopefully those are new two new ways to kind of work with color by tag even if you just don't do the materials override and you know you like to apply materials to geometry of course that's kind of the normal way to do it that's the default way to do it maybe the expected way to do it but just using the color by tag feature to double check what came into your model what tag it's on and just kind of reminding you keep things tagged keep things organized as you go it's going to help out a lot so I'm going to stop there I'm going to say thanks for watching don't forget to like comment share subscribe and comment again because I say that last because I do read the comments I respond to them let me know if there's another way if you use color by tag differently if there's something that I missed something you didn't know let us know in the comments that helps that feedback helps us make the videos that you want to see so I'm going to leave it there thanks for watching and see you next time [Music] thank you
