hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to take a deep dive into ad location SketchUp 2024 so right here right now as in me recording this video it's April 2024 SketchUp for desktop 2024 was just released uh and the change to ad location is pretty significant it works way different than the old ad location did so this may hold true in future versions I don't know if you're in the future running 25 26 28 probably not 27 I don't know this may still work uh but it is a significant difference from like 2322 so I wanted to run through it and show there's some organizational tools some some changes to how it works that are awesome that I really want to take a look at so let's hop in look at ad location sketch up for desktop 20124 plus all right so I got an empty model here I'm just going to hop right in and we are going to import some geometry um this get my fill the screen up here like that and then we're going to go to file add location all right so when add location pops up first thing is should to do is it's going to drop this pin somewhere in the world uh this is based on maybe where you're at or something like so right now I'm I'm in Longmont and it's dropping me in Longmont and that's cool but that's not what I want to bring in this is a flat chunk of land right here I don't want to do that I want to find some bumps fortunately I'm in Colorado and all you got to do if you're in Colorado on the Front Range is move west so we're going to come right over here to where we got some bumps now you notice when I panned over I'm just zooming and panning using my my scroll wheel and my mouse button when I get over here it says do you want to move your location pin your location pin is your origin of your drawing in reference to the imported geometry so right now if I was to import this chunk of geometry right here this this location right here it would show up way down the red axis from my origin right so be somewhere way over here that's okay but really ideally I want my origin to be near what I'm importing so I'm going to say okay move my pin here that's going to drop my pin right here and I can actually specifically place it where I want I'll place right at this crossroads right here why I don't know just seems like a good place to put it and zoom in and actually let go a little more specific right there all right so what I'm doing there is I'm placing my origin as reference to the geometry I'm about to import the other thing I can reference there is North I can see that North is this orange arrow pointing up uh and that's about all the information I have on here I do need to pick my pin put it in my right spot because once I go in and start picking tiles to import I can't move that pin anymore not a lot of options on here if I have a specific location I want to search for I can type that in right here uh if I want to toggle show sh the model on and off if I I'm starting not from a blank model like I am but if I'm starting with an existing model I can say show my model on the screen and it will pop up and actually show my model relative to where my origin is in this case all I got is Teddy so Teddy's showing up somewhere down there as a little little there she is little tiny person right there um so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to say okay this is good this looks good I want to import geometry around here so I'm going to hit continue all right so this is going to take me into a map where I can actually pick the geometry I want to import so I'm going to choose a larger chunk of land I'm just going to grab my handles this works exactly as you would expect it to uh I can move my handles either by the side or by the corner to make this bigger if I want to move my selection window around I have this move handle I can click on and drag wherever I need to so that works really good that's simple easy get the geometry you want in here over here to the left I have two options I can import a 2d plane which is just going to be a flat rectangle that's this size with an image draped over the top that's it pull that in uh you can you can work on that I can also add a 3D mesh if I want and I can bring in both or just one if I want so in this case I want to bring in a 3D mesh and you can see once you have 3D mesh on you have access to this slider right here with this slider I can choose how dense I want this mesh that I pull in so I can say low which would be nice big triangles making this mesh uh or up to high which is going to be much smaller triangles so the the mindset I'm imagine a lot of people go I'll just bring in high all the time and that's okay if you if you if you work on like lots for individual houses high is probably fine that's going to bring in a lot of fine detail that's probably good for like you know a quarter acre acre lot something like that but if you're pulling in like an entire section of Highway that you're going to build a bridge on or something like that you may want to go a little bit lower don't bring in extra geometry you don't need uh SketchUp 24 is the fastest version of SketchUp we've ever released it is definitely deals with geometry better than ever before but there's no point in bringing in extra geometry if you don't actually need to see it if you don't actually need to reference it so I'm going to for this I'm going to go ahead and go with medium I don't know what that's going to look like exactly but I'm going to bring it in and we're going to see down below that I have the ability to choose my texture map do want to do satellite imagery or street map street map is basically what you see on your phone if you're navigating you know not no detail here this is pretty pretty vague information I'm going to stick with satellite imagery I do have the ability to say low medium or high resolution I'm going to stick with medium here too again the more geometry the higher resolution image the bigger the model the slower the import that kind of thing so just something to keep in mind down here I do have the ability to swap between Bing and digital Globe uh depending on where you're at depending on the geometry you're trying to import one or the other may have better uh you know resolution better imagery or may exist in some places not others so I going to stick with Bing on this and I'm going to say import site context uh it's going to give me a little little working on it thing you see it said it brought in four Images we're going to see what that means in just a second I'm going to go ahead and hit close ad location and zoom out here there we go that's see that's why this this feature is fun in Colorado because we get to import geometry like this um so that's pretty cool big 3D image right here uh you'll see when I first click on this it does show up in this red container that's telling me that this is locked if all you're doing is dropping a building onto this space you may just leave it locked and that's fine leave it there forever I want to go in dive in and kind of experience or or see exactly what got pulled in so I'm going to right click and I'm going to click unlock this red container is going to turn blue and now I could actually double click to enter that container if I want to before we go any deeper though I do want to come over here to tags and see how this imported so I have this geolocation content tag uh or folder in there I have a 3D terrain folder and in there I actually have a tag with my first import so I can actually toggle that on and off and I can see it turn on and off you'll also notice that I did get that solar North Line came in and I can actually see it there all right let's dive into what this is I'm going to again have this top level I'm going to double click open it and then inside there I have another container I'm going to double click to go into that container click in there I have a third container I'm going double click and go in there this container you can see has multiple groups inside here these are those four remember I said four Images 1 two 3 and four these are the four images that imported so that chunk of land I grabbed actually lapped over multiple tiles in ad location but it imported all four those so these are the actual imported tiles if I back up a container this is the full import that's this I back up another container this is my 3D terrain container back up one more container this is on the outside this is my geolocation so that seems kind of silly for One Import but let's go ahead and add a second import to it you'll make a little more sense how this is organized and why so I'm going to go back up to file go back to add location again um it's going to show me what already exists in this model it tells me this is already geolocated so I can't go search for a different location because this model is already there that makes sense if if I'm again brand new model won't show this but for geolocation I do have the ability to throw out my geolocation so I could hit the garbage right here and it'll dump it and I can pick a new spot to locate this model but for right now this is perfect because I want to import additional context models when I zoom in here or when I come in here originally initially it's showing the same import I already had it's all everything save same mesh same s everything's the same so if I want to just add to that I can grab this and I can move this to say bring in another piece now this is the cool part I really like this because what this will do is snap I'm making that noise by the way that's that's my mouth uh it's going to snap right to that previous import and I can say import site context so what this is going to do probably four again yeah same because it's the same size uh it's going to import that and I can close add location and I can see it doubled my geometry here it's still a single container I double click all right and that's going to go inside of so I just went from the geolocation container to the 3D terrain container if I double click in there now I'll see these two this is site one site two and if I go into site two double click site 2lc is also I just caught it right on the edge three different pieces now this is cool because maybe site 2 is just there for context I don't actually need it when I'm working maybe when I'm working I I need site one because this is where where I'm actually going to be putting my building placing my building that sort of thing site tw's just for maybe if I do a render like this I want to have this mount in the back or something like that what I can do is I can work most of the time with site two just turned off right I can go and do all my work like this and then only when it's time to Output only for specific things do I ever want to come in and turn this additional context on now I can keep going too I could come in here and I don't have to do one per import either watch this I can go to add location again we're good um import context that's fine and uh let's go ahead and grab this piece right here and import it and when it's done rather than saying okay I'm done let's get out of here let's say import more and I'm just choosing to import these tiles same I could actually resize this tile if I wanted let's go ahead and import one more right there in the same session I could have done that from the beginning so I could have uh gone in and imported multiple tiles right there from the beginning but I chose not to so now we look at that and go okay see look this now I have these four different sites so I could back this all the way down to just this right here and then you know maybe maybe this is my view that my working model and then when I need it I can go turn these other pieces on for output for more additional context but they're so awesome how it's how it's uh automatically broken into into different pieces here makes it super easy to choose which pieces of AD location you want at any given time uh makes it very very easy to keep your model Snappy not only show what you need and uh hide the rest and have it ready for you when you do need it so that was just a little bit deeper we just went a little bit deeper with that location than we did in that other video I'm not not a little bit we actually covered everything that was just about everything we didn't do 2D 2D is the same as 3D but with less yeah so it's just flat so uh yeah check that out try ad location 2024 see if you got questions see if there's features that I didn't mention maybe that you need to to let me know about uh take a look at that and and let me know what you guys think of the new ad location if you like that video click like down below if you haven't already do please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though do leave us a com comment let us know what you think of this new feature is there something that you think would make it even better let us know about that we're not developers but we'd like to hear those ideas and we try to pass them along if they're good ideas uh and again how do you use it what do you do what does your workflow look like how do does the your use of allocation differ from mine tell us all about it in the comments like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
