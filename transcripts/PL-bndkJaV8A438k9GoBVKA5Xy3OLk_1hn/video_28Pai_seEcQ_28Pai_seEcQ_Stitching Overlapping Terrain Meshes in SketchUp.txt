hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at combining two landscape meshes so this is actually a question I saw on the Forum and I've seen it come up several times before so regardless of how you get these meshes if this is from ad location or imported files something like that it's it's probably a never situation that you would have two pieces that directly perfectly aligned together at the edge and just merge perfectly um we're going to look at a couple different ways to go in and make these meshes line up uh and ranging in Simplicity from time consuming but not complex to maybe take a look at an extension let's check it out all right so when I'm talking about meshes this is what I'm talking about so right here we have actually looks like some some I don't know wded up pieces of paper or something but these are actually Landscapes These are nice nice big chunks of landscape and each of these just I have three copies they're both made up of two meshes so I have one mesh that goes here one mesh that goes here if you look right at the edge you can kind of see where they don't quite overlap perfectly but uh you can tell by the bounding boxes that they are lapping past each other so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to go to view and turn on my hidden geometry that's going to give me since I have this nice smooth out space this is going to give me some real uh geometry interact with now there's a couple different types of meshes you might get in here this is what's called an ordered mesh you can see uh if I look at it straight from above it looks like I have just you know same same size rectangles diagonally connected uh and that's what makes up the mesh as opposed to a mesh where I have you know different shapes triangles rectangles whatever just connecting geometry together to get a smoothing smooth geometry uh but in this ordered mesh um I can kind of see where the two overlap I can see that it doesn't line up perfect right so the edge doesn't line up and then where they actually lap over each other you can see one mesh they kind of fight for which one's on top you know one over the other fact we can we can exaggerate this a little bit by uh let's just put some colors on here I put two different colors you can see real well that they're kind of rising above and below each other so that's not ideal I mean depending what you're doing here if you had uh you know like terrain projected over this or something like that you might not even notice that but if what your goal is is I don't know maybe maybe you're Excavating and need a a measurement or something like that or I'm turning this all into a solid for some reason this setup's not ideal having these two pieces lap over each other aren't great I would want to have these two pieces tied together so we're going to look at how to go about that so the first thing I said these are two meshes these are two separate pieces so we're going to get them to tie together uh do two different ways we're do the first way we're going to start doing it by hand and I'll show you exactly how that works it's not complicated it's a little time consuming but you'll see it and then we'll uh we'll take a look at an extension option as well I know this is level up SketchUp where we stick in SketchUp and usually extensions kind of fall in the uh Beyond desktop but I have no butt but that's what we're doing so so there we go all right so if I look at these two um what I want to do is I want to get rid of some of the me I don't want overlap what I want to do is create a situation where one ends and then I have the next one starts what I'm do is I'm going to double click into this top one and I'm going to do a select um it comes up just shy of this line here so was like kind of like that all right all right so I selected everything up below this line and then I'm just going to hit delete all right so what the what that created was a gap between the two right so that looks pretty good and you can actually kind of see this is I mean this is fairly close these meshes are not too far off but they are not perfect once I have that Gap I'm going to select and actually you know what here I'm going to do this I'm going to get rid of these two over here I'm going grab these two because I want to do the same thing so I'm just going to option copy those over there that way for the next solution uh I'll start with the same on the same step so once I have them both I'm going to select them and I'm going to explode them now we're to look at two different ways to to get this uh knitted together first way oh some of you already knew this was coming is to stitch and by Stitch I mean draw a line between each of these points just connecting the geometry together geometry you guys know what I was talking about geometry together like this and this is it this is called stitching and I have talked about before that uh I tend to find this kind of soothing this is It's repetitive it is not complicated it is boring uh so if you if you you know if you're if you're a real busy busy person you're busy designer getting stuff done stitching might be an opportunity for you to just Zen out relax be cool that kind of thing um so you can see it's not difficult but this is this is solid uh you know this is solid intern work right here this is not fun to do this is not a great way to spend a lot of time I'm not going to do the whole thing I'm going to do a chunk once that's in there you can grab my grab the Eraser option smooth all these edges I just created and there we go and then once I actually I'll shift erase this so it matches the other edges and now if I come in here to uh View and turn my hidden geometry off that's all going to lock together just as smooth as the rest of it perfect um that is one way to do that and like I said I don't know two three minutes a couple minutes of stitching would be get that all done um I'm not going to make you guys watch that that's boring that's not that's not fun so the other way I could do this is turn hidden geometry back on again is going to be to use the move command so if I come into to move and I have nothing highlighted I can move over a point I can click on that point and now that point is connected to my cursor and now I can grab that point and I bring it up and click it to uh another existing Point sometimes this gets a little finicky I'll be honest I've I've played with this and I've had the most uh success for whatever reason when I do these meesh is is grabbing it from the underside and trying to connect it together I have zero clue why I struggle to do this from above but it's fairly easy From Below but that's what happens sometimes you when you try to move points like this you'll end up having to force it to move like in an XY or Z so on one of the colored axes um using the uh arrow keys so it's possible you'll hit something like that but you see it's it's this again not difficult but really it's pretty simple it's not there's not there's not again time consuming yeah mind- numbing maybe a bit but difficult no not difficult uh it just takes a little bit when you're done the big difference of course is your order right you you have you still maintain that kind of ordered mesh whereas over here I ended up with this odd section and I actually jumped here and I I changed the direction of my diagonals whereas this looks a little bit different so you can see again view hidden geometry you can see those two pieces stitch up either way it gets you this nice smoothness but like I said and this is a fairly big plot of land too uh not a ton of fun so what about using an extension to do this let's hop over here I'm going to explode these two just like I did before so there's a couple of lofting tools out there the one of my favorites is curval Loft uh from Fredo great way to go in and just fill this all in at once what I need for curve off to work though is an edge I need an edge on both sides and then curve off will Stitch it together so I don't have an edge here so when I look at this mesh right now this is so this this is an ad location mesh this was pulled in from add location so when I double click on it uh I'm going to actually go in View and turn on my hidden geomet omry and now I'm going to double triple click excuse me select it all and if I go to soft and smooth edges um I'm going to turn off all smoothing additionally I have to go up to entity info and turn all visibility on so edges inside so I'm just going to grab one Edge it is smoothed but it is also invisible so to get it to come back I have to select it turn visibility on and then un soften and smooth it obviously this isn't ideal this is not what I want so I'm going to I'm going to Triple click both of them and then I'm going to Res smooth them so that those inside lines disappear but I still have my outside edges because what I'm going to want to do now I'm going to turn view turn my Hing geometry off I just need to tell it I'm going to have this Edge and this Edge Loft together and we've done several videos on curve aoft you guys haven't seen it search our Channel there's a bunch of these but I'm just going to go in here to Fredo 6 collection I'm going to go to Cur aoft and I am going to curve Loft by spline I'm going to grab this Edge and this Edge hit do it all right and that creates a new Surface connecting the two together when it creates it it creates in its own group so I'm going to select it and explode it that should join it all together we click One Last Time toggle soft and smooth on and there we go now I have that in one piece you saw how saw how quick that goes uh kind of a testament to this is a perfect example of extensions yeah there's a manual way to do it but invest in an extension and you might uh save yourself some carpal tunnel not too much clicking there but there you go a couple of quick and easy ways to take multiple trains and combine them into one so hopefully that uh is helpful to you and uh if you've ever run into this with imported meshes I guess it doesn't have to be terrain we use we this this example happen to come from terrain but anytime you have flowing meshes that merge into each other um you could also do some stuff with intersect and that kind of thing the problem with intersect Tyson just did a video on intersect which is awesome showed how how intersect with selection Works um if you have two meshes that literally cross over each other like that works great for intersect the problem with this is our two meshes like we saw remember when we had color coded they kind of lapped above and below each other so intersect would have created some weirdness it would have created a bunch of pieces where I have to go and I'd have to select and delete different chunks and pieces it wouldn't have worked well it wouldn't have been smooth uh my connection would not have been good like that so if if I have meshes that cross over each other perfect for intersect if they're butting up against each other like that uh you got to go with something like lofting or a little bit of stitching if you like that video go ahead and click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe what I would love to see though is a comment let me know if you've run into something like this maybe you have a better way of going about this maybe there's a system that you've come up with that is even better I would love to hear about it down in the comments below or if you've never run into this and there's a different situation you hit inside of SketchUp and you want to get some advice on how to deal with it let me know that too we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
