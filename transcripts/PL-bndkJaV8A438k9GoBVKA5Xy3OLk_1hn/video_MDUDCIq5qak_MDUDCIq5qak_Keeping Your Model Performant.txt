hey guys I'm Aaron and today I'm going to give you a couple tips on how to keep your models light and performant so we've done videos like this multiple times we do them I actually they're pretty probably pretty regular um one of the things that SketchUp will let you do is it will let you make a model that is difficult to work with it will let you download furniture and and import big imagery and and put a bunch of stuff in your model that makes it so it in theory looks nice but is so difficult to use the file size is so huge that it has a hard time working so I wanted to touch on two or three things that you can do to keep your model performant and if you do these things you shouldn't have problems with you know a model that won't rotate or takes several minutes to open or anything like that so let's take a look right now all right so I have a model here and if I try to rotate I don't know if you guys are seeing that but it's it's choppy it's jumping as I as I as I spin around it's not so big if you get your model too big and you start animating components turn into black boxes and that kind of stuff and it it gets kind of kind of yucky but uh this has some stuff going on if this file is bigger than it should be and it's not the geometry if I if I zoom in here and look at like the geometry on these these uh doors of this container they're they're not crazy detailed right this is a decent level of detail for this kind of model I have some round stuff so I mean I do have some extra faces here and but it's not crazy it's not out of control the sides of this are super look at that super slim super tight um not a ton of geometry this is not a ridiculous model I mean some models you know if I'm using like circles with a hundred sides or something ridiculous like that then I could see why this would be choppy but as it stands there's just a handful of things that are they're causing this to be big and I'm I'm illustrating the the little bit of drag as I orbit but there's other issues that come along too right is uh newer versions of SketchUp do have more compact files than they used to but it is still possible to get a file that is like big like too big hard hard to transfer around um we're not quite there with this but but it's possible we could see that from here um and I just want to touch on a handful of things that might help keep your file size down so first thing I mean one thing I do want to mention on this isn't this isn't about file size or or making your model more uh you know easier to open that kind of thing but as far as orbiting this right here profiles is one of the things that kills kills models quickly profiles what profiles does is it just says okay lines that are in the middle are going to be thin and lines around the outside edge will be slightly thicker it's even hard to tell on here that that's on because it's only the edge lines are only twice as wide as the the field edges um but what happens is every time I orbit SketchUp has to go check again and goes okay which line is on the edge now which line is on the edge now which signs that so it's constantly checking your model to see which line should be drawn with the profile 2 as opposed to default profile of one turning off profiles you can see you can see the difference right see those those hard line the darker lines um personally I mean I'd be totally asked you guys I like the look of SketchUp but I like modeling without profiles I think it ends up looking cleaner and lighter uh so I generally do most of my work without profiles so that's one tip that's one thing turn profiles off especially if you have a big model the other thing and I'm gonna zoom in here and show you what I'm talking about so I got some plants in here some of you already know where I'm going but if I show hidden so I'm gonna get a bunch of extra lines and that again is going to cause a Slowdown to my animation because again SketchUp draws what's on the screen so you can see that also the further out you pull the more it slows down as you zoom in you may hit this like barrier Rawson boom you zoom fast but having extra edges on versus off sketchups can be more performant when your hidden stuff is hidden and when you show all those edges all right speaking of these good looking plants they're they're nice they're they're I don't wanna I don't complain about it but they contain a ton of geometry okay this plant right here contains more geometry than the whole rest of the model so this is not a simple fix there is not a a button in SketchUp that says make this one thing more performant what you will want to do is when you are importing Entourage into your model use 3D Warehouse that's what it's there for it's awesome it is a great place to go get resources but pay attention to what you're downloading in 3D Warehouse you have the ability to view and even you know I could actually go in so if I look at this right here I pick on it it's going to tell me there are a quarter million polygons in this if these are just little pieces that are accent pieces there's no reason to put a quarter million extra polygons into your model this isn't huge either there are models up here that have two three times this geometry if it's a hero piece if you're doing a render of this model this makes a lot of sense but as a little piece it's adding some color probably not the right thing to have there so when you're in 3D Warehouse you do have the ability here to say well I don't want a big heavy thing in fact I want to keep it down to like yeah two thousand what do you what do I got for a hanging plant with 2 000 faces oh look at this hanging spider plant 274 this is one one thousandth of this the geometry so that's out there that's an option that is one of the two biggest things that happens in models where people like oh my model's so huge or it's not performing there's two things I look for that is that is probably number one big ugly geometrically intense models downloaded from warehouse and that's not to say these are bad models these are great models but again depending on what so if this is I'm trying to render something like this and I can barely see these things is it worth having like a majority of the geometry in my entire model dedicated to these things probably not another thing that ends up being a big issue is materials so as you put in materials so if I import materials I imported you know leaves for this which came in with the model from 3D Warehouse I may have created custom colors for this you know this the specific green or this orange or maybe I pulled in grass fire that came in um as I pull in materials you do want to be conscious of the file you pull in or of of the of the size of the the images you pull in so what do I mean by that well each of these everything that everything that's not white on here has either a color or a material associated with it if it's has a material associated with it that file so if it's a a JPEG you pulled in like this fire is a perfect example so I pulled in a picture of a fire and I put it in this fireplace that picture that image of the fire is saved as the jpeg file into my model so as you put in more and more materials more and more images are being imported they are being added to your model that's not a bad thing it's it's good I mean SketchUp lets you create some really good looking models that way but you do have to be conscious of how big they are so we are talking level up SketchUp but I'm going to talk about one extension real quick and that is an extension called material resizer material Sizer is an extension is available from SketchUp so we actually our team our extensibility team created this and what it will do is it'll run through your whole model and it will tell you how big each material that's been imported is so as I look at this we have a bunch of materials that are it makes sense they're a little you know picture of foliage whatever no big deal but up here I have some that are really big so here's a here's a picture of a leaf is a picture of a single leaf and it is 2300 by 3 400 pixels not the end of the world this is not not a ridiculous uh amount but it is a lot for maybe that big of a leaf you could probably drop again depends what you're using it for if I'm rendering the sleeve okay that makes sense green right here this is a Swatch of this green color and it's 8 000 by 8 000 pixels that I'm gonna go ahead and call that ridiculous that is totally unnecessary if I'm using a color I shouldn't be importing it to begin with but the fact that I have this and it's that big is taking that much memory or that much space in my file that's terrible this extension right here material resizer will let you take any files you think are too big say how big do you want them and then you just hit go and then what it will do is it'll run through the model and it will resize each of the selected images so it is less than that material so what that did was that ended up saving space in your model all right one last thing I want to mention and we mentioned this a lot but everybody always gets or we always find somebody who watches these videos or sees these comments in the Forum and gets excited that is purging so if you go to window and you click model info uh and then click on the statistics tab over here it's going to tell you everything that's in this model right so here's here's all the stuff that's in here edges faces components guides everything now the thing about SketchUp is it holds on the things you pull the model even if they're not part of the modeling window so if I come over here and close Styles and pull up components and look at what's in this model so let's let's do this too let's let's get some thumbnails let's close this let's make this bigger so it's going to show me all the things that are in here so if I look at this I look at this model right here um I've got sumelli in here but I don't actually see her in the model uh I've got Heather I've got some other some indoor Ficus I don't know what that is here's my model of these these three components and then I have some other pieces so I have multiple pieces here if I looked at my colors there remember I was looking at my color window before uh so if I pull my paint bucket back up um I have a lot of materials here I don't actually know if every one of these is being used and SketchUp saves them even if they're not in the actual model so if you add a color here it's going to stay here this this mauve color I might actually be using anywhere but it's saved as part of the model same with these components indoor Ficus I downloaded it and didn't like it it's still saved in the model so what purge does if I go into model info statistics I have this button called Purge unused if I click that it's going to run through the model with on my screen and it's going to say okay everything here is accounted for anything that's not here in the actual model itself out that doesn't mean stuff is turned off if it's in the model and it's on a tag that's toggled off or it's hidden something like that it'll stay in the model but if it's not if it's not actively being used anywhere in the model it'll go away so I'm gonna go ahead and run it it's hard to I mean just keep an eye out let's see what happens here um oh do you see that look it have it over here I had four components go away let's bring our Paint Bucket so remember that that was overflowing off the edge so a bunch of colors went away too so purge is huge if you use 3D Warehouse a lot you may have a model full of 3D 3D Warehouse models that you're not actually using and Purge can do things like cut in half or even down like 25 of your file size by getting rid of all that extra content that's being saved in the model so keeping these things in mind is going to help you create models that are Snappy easy to use and you know don't take multiple minutes to open or save or anything like that I don't know if you've ever run in this model some people are really really Vigilant modelers and they always you know keep track of everything hit Purge every time they say that kind of thing um if you're using the online version it does automatically for you um but if you've ever run into a model where it tends to be those experimenting models you know I'm just I'm playing with this idea I'm trying a thing out if you run into that situation uh you might want to run through what's in this video and just go back and see if maybe there's a thing or two there that could help save you some time energy space pain regret all the negative things Purge might just take care of most of it but if you like that video go ahead and click like down below and if you don't already please subscribe and leave us a comment let us know if you've tripped up on this or what you think of this if you're going to give it a shot like making these videos a lot more on the showing something you want to see thank you thank you
