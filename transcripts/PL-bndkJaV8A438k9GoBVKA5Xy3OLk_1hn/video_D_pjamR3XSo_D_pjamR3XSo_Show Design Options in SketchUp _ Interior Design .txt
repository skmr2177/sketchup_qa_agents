hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about how to use tags and scenes to explore [Music] options so we've done something like this before but uh I did want to talk about like specifically to interior design and some ways you can use things I also wanted to cover a couple things that I've seen recently uh about how people think scenes and tags work and they don't work the way that I've seen people thinking they should work work so I wanted to cover that as well but what we're going to do is we're going to go into this living room right here and look at a couple different ways we could arrange the furniture and we'll save both of them so we can flip back and forth with a button click let's check it out all right so here we have uh just this little building vignette with some walls and inside we have some furniture so I group I mean we could do this piece by piece by piece but I just to make this easier I grouped the furniture into groups so over here we have against this wall is a piece of art uh a couch and then a end table uh on this side we have a couch some end tables chairs and a different piece of art and then here below the window we have uh a couple chairs and a little end table as well uh there's a coffee table in the middle we're just going to leave that where it is and we're going to look at the how this all could work if maybe maybe we wanted to switch these so put you know I I think the art goes together the colorful one with the gray couch and the colorful couch with the black and white photo I think that works so let's I was saying just as a whole I'm going to keep these sets of furniture together and just flip them so let's figure out how how we could do that um what I don't want to do is have to have like multiple models that I switch between or anything like that I want to keep this simple so what we're going to do is we're going to use tags and scenes to make it so I can real quickly and easily just check out one thing or what get out of here all right sorry about that some s loose geometry sneaks in and tries to ruin my day so we're going to see what that looks like so first thing we'll do is we will save this setup so this setup is the first one we going to look at so I'm going to go over here to tags and uh I'm going to start by looking at tags so I have some uh tags in here there are different um I don't know different materials imported from 3D Warehouse that kind of thing so I'm going to make a a new tag and this new tag is going to be op option A enter and I'm going create a second one called op sh B you guys probably already figured that one out um and then I'm going to take this group this group and this group and assign all three of those to option A so I'm going to come in here I'm going say put all these on option A and there we go now if I turn option A off my furniture goes more loose geometry trying to ruin my day all right so all the geometry goes away if I turn off option A that's perfect that's what I want now what I want to do is I want to create a new thing on option b where the furniture is different so I'm going to go back into option A I'm going to select these three pieces I'm going to copy them and paste them just out here off to the side that sort of thing so now I have a copy of both now I'm going to take them all right now before I do anything else and I'm going to put them on option b so now when option A goes away my furniture for option b is still here I'm going to take this here's what I'm going to do for option b we're going to get rid of these tables here we're going to grab this stuff right here flip it around 180Â° and then we'll just plunk that right against the wall like that and then we'll drop it down so uh it's on the ground which just you know I don't want to judge you for how you do things but I like my couches on the ground okay pull it for a little more that looks all right um I obviously the end tables this stuff needs to be on the outside so I'm going to make a change I'm going to go into this group and I'm going to grab these pieces slide them over this direction and then uh we can actually flip them I like with that like that and we'll slide it back over that looks good and then this one right here same thing come in here we'll grab this and this we'll take that right over here this way and I liked it the way it was too with the actually I kind of like that that's kind of whoa I don't know what's going on there actually uh I feel like that needs to be in there any I doesn't matter um I could do cleanup but that's not what we're here for so now my option b is reversed so I can switch these by going tags boom tags boom but that's a pain in the butt so I don't want to have to click stuff on and off I just want a single button to say option a option b and I can flip back between them and this is where scenes come into play I'm going to close entity info I'm going and expand scenes and I want to see all of scenes so first thing I'm going to do is okay so let's get option A set up this is where we started option A so what I want to do is I want to make a scene that shows all these things are visible so I'm going to come in here and I'm going to say turn turn everything off except visible tags everything else gets turned off and then I can go ahead and create a scene all right and I'm going to call this uh Furniture a okay so now I have an option for furniture a now I'm going to swap I'm going to turn a off off B on and I'm going to create a new scene and that new scene also has only visible tags on and I'm going to call that also Furniture B so now what I can do is I can swap just with the Click A and B I can switch between the two sets and the cool thing is because the only thing that these scenes are connected to is the visibility tag means I can walk around and look at this model so I'm look I'll look at it right here I'll look like this and see what does this look like a b a b I'll flip around look over here how's this look from this side how if I switch it oh yeah I like that uh and I can make my decision based on I while I'm orbiting around I can swap between the two so this is a pretty cool feature if you're trying to show somebody options uh you can do it this way so I said I was going to mention things it doesn't do so what scenes or tags don't do is they don't control location of geometry so that's why the first thing I did after I set up option A was I copied it all out and put it on a different tag option b so this sofa right here this is in the model two times this one's in the model two times this picture in the model two times it only controls the state of visibility it does not control location so some people try to make animations in SketchUp by grabbing something all right so I'm going to have this here and then the second scene I'm going to have it over here expecting it to move across the scene as they or move across the screen as they change scenes that's not how SketchUp Works what SketchUp does is it looks at all of these settings and says okay activate these settings that are saved for the scene so for this one by switching scenes all we're doing is saying check which tags are visible and set them to this so that's why so it's nice because the other thing that people think with scenes is that scenes is be probably because of the name it always controls where the camera's at but it does not have to if camera location's not turning on like this I can swap between it and this the camera never has to move at all so very powerful way to use the tools that are already there I know some people use scenes for just animations some people use scenes just to set the camera but remember scenes can do so much more all this stuff can be turned on and off so I mean you could have a scene that is just dedicated to control rolling your section planes flipping section planes on off maybe we'll do that next let me know in the comments you guys want me to see me create a section plane uh scenes because that could be kind of cool too but yeah so check that out if you are doing something like a layout or alternative ways to view models or rearrange stuff quick and easy super simple just uh set up those two tags and then assign each tag on a visible tag only scene and you can flip right between them so I'm hoping that that connects with someone um I think it's a cool way to do it I've used this on a lot of different projects as ways to like just flip through stuff we've done this a little bit we did this is kind of a a variant of the thing we did around the holidays last year where we did Chasing Lights very similar the thing to remember is that tags and scenes don't move stuff they just turn turn it on and off so you can mimic animation or things moving by doing that like a you know still frame animation kind of thing but for the most part if you're using animation or if you're using those scenes you're just setting the state of what's visible right now and just remember the big thing if there's anything to remember it's that not everything has to be turned on you can turn on just certain items and then that'll only activate those things in that scene if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe more importantly than that though more importantly than anything leave us a comment down below and let us know what you think is this useful did you get something out of this uh do you have a different way you would do something like this love to hear about that too I love to hear your workflows when you have them and they help me out a lot uh most importantly though do you have an idea for a video you think would you would like us to see or like us to make we'll see it you'll see it when we make it uh let us know about that too we like making these videos a lot we like me more when just showing something you want to see thank you
