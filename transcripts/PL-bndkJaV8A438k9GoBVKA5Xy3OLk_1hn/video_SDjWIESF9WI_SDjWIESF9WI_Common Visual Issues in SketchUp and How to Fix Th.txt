hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to look at some of the top visual issues you might run into SketchUp and how to fix them with as little as one button [Music] click okay so visualization issues I know it's kind of a vague description uh stuff going on on your screen in your model that you don't expect or don't want to be happening does that make sense so this isn't modeling issues this isn't geometry is not right this is uh it doesn't look the way I hold it I wanted it to look um we see these things on the Forum all the time and it's funny cuz like I would say majority of the time there's a super simple fix something that wasn't quite set up right or a setting that's wrong um and we're going to run through a bunch of those right now okay so first one you guys have probably already seen it see these dashed edges in back here these show up uh these are back edges so this is a function inside of SketchUp this is intentional it's supposed to work work this way uh this is showing where the back edges are the edges that aren't visible to the camera are overlaid onto my model so all these little Dash lines are actually the back edges and this is a function that is supposed to happen this way to show me where those are so this is without going into uh to x-ray mode where I see through the model which is a very intensive process to to make everything see through this is a short simple sweet much lighter process so you're working the big model and you want to see where the back edges are where the the stuff you can't see is back edges will let you see that without having to do an x-ray on the whole model that's the idea behind it um people toggle it on on accident all the time because the default shortcut key for it is just K if you were typing and you hit a k or something like that or you you go to hit L to hit the line you accidentally tap k something like that your back edges will show up fortunately it's just as easy to turn off as it is turn on you could hit K the shortcut key or if you like men you go to view Edge style and right there see it's toggled on you just toggle it off and that goes away pretty simple all right next thing that comes up I'm going to go over here into my Styles menu and I'm going to look right now I have ambient occlusion turned on but I don't see those Telltale little Shadows so what I do when that happens is I turn up the distance no turn up the intensity no for some reason my ambient occlusion Shadows are just not showing up what is that about well again I'm going to say use that term again nine times out of 10 but often what happens is people see this issue and it's because their model is not to scale so they either were haphazardly just went in started modeling and didn't realize they were modeling something way bigger than they thought or they accidentally scaled their model up some something like that um the fact is ambient oclusion is a onetoone effect so it scales Shadows at intersections based on reality and the scale of things in real life so if I come in here if I grab an edge and I go from one corner here to this corner over here I can see that is currently 46,000 ft no 4600 4,600 ft too big either so yeah 46,000 would be big but 4600 is also too big so this model got out of scale because this is supposed to be 32 ft so what we're going to do I'm going to double click to enter this group right my tape measure and tell it from here to here should be 32t enter do I want to scale this group yes I do there we go and then I'm just going to hit oh see immediately see those Shadows pop right in there they're a little excessive right now so I may want to actually come in and dial them back just a little bit maybe a little less intense uh I don't know maybe it's supposed to be a haunted house and they should be intense anyhow that will get that for you there we go all right next issue you're probably already seeing it on your screen see as I rotate how I'm like especially look at these columns right here it's easiest to see here see how they're just jumping back and forth like crazy that is an issue that is actually pretty easy to fix so what we're going to do is we're going to look at exactly how to fix that problem you also see right here see the front and back faces kind of start popping through each other this is not Z fighting some people see this and go oh that's just Z fighting those back edges are popping through but these are actually the faces are overlapping each other as I move these things are jumping by a couple pixels across back and forth on the screen the issue with this is that this model is too far from the origin this is the same issue that we run into with sometimes you want to model really small geometry you won't let you similar issues happen when you model too big of geometry so this can happen with like an import model with you know real world location or or or or uh numbers in here where where this is ends up real far away from where the origin is so first I want to do is go to view and see if my axes are turned on they are turned on okay so now how do I get this oh I saw I saw it Go by there's my Axis see that and I am so so far away from it I can't even see oh there it is all right so let's do this let's grab this let's grab by corner and let's try to get to the axis I'm going to zoom way I'm Zoom way out and just come over here click on the axes and then let's go back to there we go so I grabbed an arbitrary Corner which turned out to be that one probably fix it up now and same like that corner should be in there but you see now as I oh see nice clean nice clean orbiting that's awesome all right so something else some of you probably are already seeing this and going I I have a weird perspective on this this doesn't this almost looks like I don't know something something feels weird about this perspective and I don't know some people will hit this some people will like it almost feels like an isometric View and I'm not getting that true perspective so it doesn't look like a real model it looks wonky looks off um if I come up to camera and I see that it's not in parallel projection but it is in perspective but it still feels almost like it's in parallel projection it's hard to describe but you can see like when I look at this right here I would expect this back edge of this roof to look significantly smaller than this because this is closer to me and this as it goes in the distance should come together but it almost looks parallel or even flared out which is a little bit of an optical illusion but this happens sometimes um so if you go up here and you're in parallel projection you switch to perspective everything fixes that's great but if you're already in perspective it means your field of view is probably set extremely low so if I click on field of view and look down the lower right corner yep it's set to one so what I'm going to do is set it to the default is about 35 so hit 35 and hit enter there you go see how that makes much more it just looks more real so if I look at this see that the front edge is wider than the back Edge so it it gets smaller as the as the model goes off in the distance just a more natural look this is not you don't have to do this but a lot of people expect their models to look like this when you're working with the in 3D excuse me um and that is a quick and easy fix just check your field of view check to see that you actually are in perspective view all right so another thing that might happen that looks weird is why do I have a gray chimney if I pick on this face of the material and I click entity info it tells me this mat material is this terracotta color but for whatever reason it's showing up as gray um well that gray color is actually the back so in entity info I have two boxes the front face and the back face the back face has looks like two materials but this is actually telling me it's a two-sided material the back face has a material that on the front is white and on the back is this blue gray and since these are all showing up as blue gray it's telling me that those face I'm seeing the back face if I want to double check this I can go to my view and I can go to face style and I can turn on monochrome monochrom going to show everything front or back faces you can see very clearly that is all back face so I easy fix again select the faces that our back face right click and hit reverse face and they come out white in monochrome and if I go back up to face style and turn shade with textures on again that's the proper color that was what I'm looking for right there so if you ever see materials that look like they're not quite right or they're showing up as gray or whatever your back face color is easy enough to flip them I'm seeing one more issue right here this material I don't understand what's going on there why is that oh if I zoom in I can see it is a brick material it just somehow got scaled down so it's easy enough to select materials and go to position and with position you can rotate change scale that sort of thing but if you ever get it to the point where it's not the way you want it to be you do have the option of going to texture and hitting reset position that will put it back to the default the way it was originally applied to the material so that's something that surprisingly people run into materials of different scal not just not just scaled small but scaled large like why are my bricks 3 feet tall each there's a possibility that the material got scaled so there you go I said a handful what was that six different things that could happen in your SketchUp model and how to quickly and I got to say pretty easily get them fixed um this of course like I said is not comprehensive there's other things you might run into and maybe you have seen some visual issues and you fix them or maybe you've seen some visual issues and you don't know how to fix them they're still an issue for you if either of those is true leave us a comment down below tell us about issues you've run into and how you gotten past them or tell us issues that you're still running into and you need help with if you haven't already done it too hop in there and hit like if you like this video subscribe if you haven't already we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment like I said tell us about those issues you run into or if you have an idea for a different video that you think would be good you like making these videos a lot like me more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
