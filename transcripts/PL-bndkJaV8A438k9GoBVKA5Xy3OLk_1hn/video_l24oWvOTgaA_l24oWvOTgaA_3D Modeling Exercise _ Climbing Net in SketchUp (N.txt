hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to put a climbing net on this playground I know I can already hear now I don't model climbing Nets what am I going to learn from this valid very valid point but as usual when we make these videos we try to come up with something that uh is is easy to understand clearly illustrates some modeling topics and then teaches you something so I don't ever plan to never plan to have to model something like this but uh I did find it had some cool things that we learn I learned about follow me's components um uh welding arcs a whole bunch of things came out of this so uh even though you might not have to do anything like this in your day-to-day job I recommend giving this a shot because it is a pretty cool model and a good learning experience so let's hop right in okay so here's our playground we did this last time or a while ago we did some slides straight slide and then a curvy slide we're going to come in now and we're going to do just a climbing net right off of this side so what I want to do is I want to have one two three four ropes come down and just kind of come down and angle out you know so it'll be wider at the bottom than it is at the top um and then I want to do you know three or four rungs across like that I want to have it attach up underneath here so I'm going to start with an edge across here this is a group so I don't want to mess with that geometry so I'm going to draw this Edge and I'm going to divide it right now and I said I want four pieces coming down so that means five total segments one so there'll be one here um I'm going to start with this piece right here I'm going to drop down I'm going to inference to the bottom of this column this post and then have it come out about that Farish so not a real specific not a real hard uh geometry thing here just kind of looks good looks good um so what I want to do is I want to have this rope drop vertically and then kind of come out like that so it'll be vertical for a little while and then it will slope out so I'm going to grab an arc come part way down like that and then bring that out like that perfect that's what I'm looking for so my rope's going to slope down and then out all right um up here I can actually get rid of a lot of these edges this Edge on the over here isn't me thing I do need this Edge and this and this to all go into a component and I'm going to just call this my I should call my vertical it's not totally vertical but you know it goes up and down it's an up and down e rope that kind of vertical I'm going to say create that and then I can actually get rid of the rest of these Edge segments over here I don't need those all right now I'm going to take this piece I'm going to go option move to the end of here 2x is going to give me no sorry 3x is going to give me four total pieces looks pretty good I don't need this extra I can come in here and get rid of some extra geometry now I don't need these two lines I don't need that line that's all I need um actually go back in there again I should probably also weld this I'm going to grab all the edges so it's just it's one Arc and a vertical Edge and I will grab those and click weld real quick nice all right now they look good but they're vertical I said I want this to kind of spread out at the bottom so I'm going to grab this first one I'm going hit rotate I'm going to go to the top point and hit the up Arrow to lock in that vertical axis click right here here and then rotate it like 20° do the same thing on this one right here rotate right here up Axis here bring that out 20° that looks good these ones need a little bit of a a turn too so I'm going to grab this one up click here go like I don't know more that like 7° 7° 7° is perfect I meant to do 7° all all along all right up a lock that inference here 7° cool those are my horizontal ropes I'm not going to leave them as just edges like this we're going to do a follow me to put uh you know some some width on the Rope but before I do that while I still have just edges I want to put my rungs on here so I'm going to come in here click right here come over here and maybe drop down a little like that straight across and then come back up here we go I'm going to grab those right click and make that into a group I don't make a component here because there's only only going to be these will all be different each one will be a little bit different size so um let's see we'll go up about that same amount here to here to here up to here grab those right click make them another group and then one more so on this one we'll go here right and then that's actually a straight line because that's all those vertical edges all lined up so maybe we should put a little bit of a just a little bit of a droop in those lines instead there we go looks a little better and we'll grab those three edges and make that a group all right now we're almost there so that's that's looking good this is this is kind of the spider we look this is all super thin just just edges no geometry so not good for final but for right now that works so let's go in and add some uh some rope to these edges so I'm going to grab a circle go here on the top my normal Circle side is 24 I'm going to use one that's 12 um so I'm just going to grab right here I'm going to come at like5 in for my radius uh it's going to give us a 1 in piece of material and then I welded this Edge so I can select it follow me click on my 1in circle there we go perfect so I have those pieces of rope coming down oh that's that's just right all right I'm going to come into this piece I'm going to grab this right click I'm going to say weld edges I'm going to draw a circle right here draw it vertically like this say 0 five there we go and then I can just say follow me click here and there we go next rope looking good um so something to point out I did not make this rope this circle perfect cuz I didn't make the edge perpendicular exactly perpendicular to the line it was following but really for this I think it's going to be okay I mean it is a rope ropes are not perfect circles anyhow so I don't I'm not going to lose sleep over that one um going to go ahead and weld these again another Circle right here point5 follow me click and then one more come in here again select all these now that helps cement in a workflow by like doing it over and over again you know so uh yeah I got this one locked down now 0.5 enter follow me click all right there we go so dialog's pretty cool in fact if that was my final result I'd be pretty happy with that but I want to go a little bit further um I was looking at a playground near us and they had they had something like this and then they had like these actual like spheres that covered the connection points um I thought that looked kind of cool and I figured out you know how would I do that so I did it and we're going to do it so I'm going to start with a circle on the ground I'm just going to kind of draw a circle it doesn't matter how big bigger than bigger than I need it to be basically I'm going to draw a vertical circle from the center and this one is going to be like 2 inch radius so 4 inches right there and then I'll grab the outside Circle say follow me and click this inside Circle and then get rid of the outside Circle I take that make that into a component um I got triple click here we go and then make component and we'll just call that my sphere all right now I'm going to take this I'm going to edit and cut it not copy but cut and then I'm going to go in the context of this one piece and I'm going to paste what I want to do is I want to actually put this onto this rope but I want to put it right where that other piece comes along right now my view I have uh component edit H rest of model turned on I'm going to turn that off that way I can now take this circle and put it on top of here so I'm just going to slide it over this way slide it back this way slide over this way and I I'm realizing this is not going to work perfectly because the intersection points for these other pieces are a little off but we'll figure out how to fix that in just a few seconds all right that looks good so I'm going to go option and move that one up to here little fine-tuning move um you can see I'm using a relative move I'm not actually clicking on Geometry move it around I'm clicking in the background to just scoot it and then I will also use the arrow keys to lock as I move it perfect perfect that's good no it's got to come a little bit more there we go I'm going grab that option and one more right up here all right slide that over slide that forward a little jumpy slide that back um that looks perfect all right now if I come out here these two are going to be different at this point so they're all the same but if I want to make a change just to these two if I select both of them at the same time and click make unique what I can do is I can come in here and edit just one and you'll see the other one gets changed along with it so these two are now new connected components so they will the same change changes made to one will affect the other but not the previous ones cuz the previous ones were a different component that has now been made unique but because I grabbed two of them at the same time now all edits done in one of them shows up the same way in the next one so good tip for uh making changes the biggest thing with making changes to components is making sure you're ready for that that change to happen does that mean like if I done this earlier on I would have had to do follow on more than one piece of these so that sort of thing making sure you're at the spot where the geometry is ready to be abandoned as far as making additional changes all right now that I got all that I'm going to go ahead and grab everything put that into a group and then I'm going to slide that group just back so it's under the lip that is what I want from my rope ladder looking pretty cool all right so like I said you may not have to make rope ladders or rope Nets or climbing Nets or this looks like a piece of rigging from a pirate ship maybe none of that stuff may be something you use regularly but I wanted to show you just kind of some different ways to use components and use geometry you might not normally do uh a few weeks ago we did a thing on moving from beginner to intermediate to master SketchUp modeler and one of the things I I pointed out was you know learning to model things you don't normally model and this this one fell squarely outside of my realm of things I normally model so I figured I would pass it along try to expand your horizons and your modeling abilities if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you be notified of all of them if you subscribe more importantly than that though leave us a comment down below what did you think of that can you think of something else that you were not quite sure how to model like help with leave that down in the comments we like making these videos a lot you like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
