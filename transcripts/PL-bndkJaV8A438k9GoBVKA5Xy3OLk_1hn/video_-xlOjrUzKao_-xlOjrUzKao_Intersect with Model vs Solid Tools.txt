hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time we're going to contrast two different methods of how to join solid objects [Music] together so I was recently uh working with a friend and they had the question they were creating this coffee mug and wanted to know how to join the mug part with a handle and we explored a couple different ways doing that and I thought it might be interesting to show two techniques the first will use um intersect with model which is available on the free version which is why I'm going to be using the web version of SketchUp in this example so we'll show how to do it with the free version using intersect with model and then we'll show that you can uh do the same thing a little bit faster using the solid tools which is part of the pro version um so just want to kind of contrast those let's jump in all right I've got this uh set up so we can make our nice mug and our handle using the follow me uh commands now first we we do want these to be solid so if I double click uh triple click on this and make this a grouper component and then look over here it is a solid this one because of how we created it let me click on this and actually move it and make sure I'm not selecting this Inner Line but if I triple click on this and I'm going to make this a group as well and we don't need those lines anymore all right so the idea what we want to do is merge these together and to do so let me make a copy because like say we're going to do this two ways now the first way again should be available even if you're using the just free web version of SketchUp and what I want to do is explore the mug part of this so I'm opening that group and I'm going to rightclick on this surface and say intersect faces with model now I'm inside the mug uh group not the handle group and what that will do is then if I click out of this and move this mug the handle away you can see it's created these edges for me now I do want to point out uhoh look we we actually it didn't fully create all the edges I need so I'm going to undo this and this is again um this kind of should be old news we're working on a lot of small tiny little geometry and SketchUp just does better with larger geometry so I'm going to scale this up and by the scale factor down here I'm going to use 10 and by using 10 I'll be able to scale it back down uh by a known Factor when we're done but by scaling this up let me go inside here grab just this surface right click and say intersect faces with model it should create those edges now I'm going to hide the rest of the model which I've got a I created a keyboard shortcut for so I'm going to hide the rest of the model and then I can see and select this face and this one and then copy those so I'm hitting controller command C and then expose the rest of the model again and then I'm going to come into this the handle part and just to show this let me hide the rest of the model and I'm going to paste in place which again I could do with the keyboard shortcut if I set one and that will create for me all of the edges I need to select the remaining geometry here and here delete those I've got a little bit of a some edges down here I better grab those two all right that should be what I need now I'm going to select both of these groups right click explode them and uh that joins them together and then if I select this and hide this Edge I should be able to come in here delete delete and unhide I can group this again and then scale it back down and remember we scaled this up by a factor of 10 so I'm going to scale it back down by 0.1 and that should return it to the original size so you can see with the intersect with model command which again is available in any version of SketchUp you can make this uh work and join kind of these complex shapes together now but we can do this a little bit easier uh with a pro version and the solid Tools in this case so I've got this and again this is a solid group and this is a solid group and I'm going to select both of these and then simply come over here and here are our solid commands so I'm going to say you know what let's trim these which is going to remove any intersecting parts of that and I'll double click into here and again hide the parts of them all I don't need then it's easy because it's disconnected to Triple click delete delete this is still a solid group this is a solid group so I can select both of these and then easily create an outer shell which merges them into one solid group so that is definitely a a faster and uh simpler way to do it but the results I'm going to scale that down by 0.1 the results are the same so just uh again different kind of methods that sometimes one works uh where another doesn't but often the solid tools can get you there faster that's it so hopefully that was a little helpful a little little comparison and again depending on what version of SketchUp you're using uh maybe something to to try out um otherwise thank you all um do like and subscribe if you haven't and do leave us some thoughts some comments and definitely some suggestions for ideas or or uh things that you would like to see us cover in the future [Music] cheers
