Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at a functionality that was introduced in SketchUp 2025 called apply tags to scenes. [Music] I'm going to walk you through this and show you step by step how this tool works. If you're using 2024 or an earlier version, you're not going to see this in there. It is in 2025 and forward. So, I'm just cutting that off. So, if you're in there saying, "Does this work in 2018?" Nope. 2025 and forward. I'm sorry. We We just hard as we try, we can't make features available before the code is written. So, we're gonna hop in and take a look at this and see why it's a great feature and how you might use it right now. All right. So, I have a pretty simple model right here. Um, I got a A, I got a B, I got a C. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take these and I'm going to put them on each on their own tag. So, I'm just going to make a couple of uh I'm going to make an A tag. I'm going to make a B tag. You guys will never guess I'm going to name the last one. The L tag. I'm kidding. It's the C tag. All right. And then I'm just going to take each of them and apply them to their own tag. So, A is going to go onto A tag. B is going to go onto B tag. And C is going to go onto the L tag. All right. So, why would I do this? Well, this is going to give me control, visibility, that sort of thing. I could create scenes off of this, that sort of thing. In this case, what I'm going to be doing is I'm just going to file and save this. And then this geometry I'm going to import into a different model. So, this this file is called tag export. And we're look at the other file I have open. I call this one base model. And it's got a D, an E, and an F. And no big surprise, these are all on the appropriately named uh tag. So here I have a D tag, an E tag, and an F tag. And I can toggle those on and off. So let's say we want to take that and we want to apply these tags to scenes. So I want a quick way to just hit one button and then E and F go away and then another button where E shows up and D and F go away. The third button that I click on and F shows up and everything else disappears. Let's do that real quick. Scenes. This is a great way to make working scenes that only show what you need visible at a certain time. So, I'm going to turn on only visible tags. I'm going to turn off E and F. I'm going to hit plus and I'm going to call this so I can remember it scene D. Enter. All right. Now, I'm going to turn off D. Turn on E. plus going to call this one scene E. Since you guys are so smart, you already know where I'm going with this. I'm going to take my F tag plus and scene F. All right. So, now that I did that, I have these buttons here which I can just quickly switch between uh the different tags. I don't have to go click turn two on and then one back or turn one on and then two back off every time. Uh, this is just a quick button click. And the nice thing is since I only save visible tags, I can spin around here. I can be moving. Uh, I could be zooming. It doesn't matter. I can do anything I want here. And it doesn't matter where I look from. I can just swap those out. It's just visibility. All right. So, that's great. So, now let's go back in here and let's go to file and import. And I'm going to import that file I was just working on. So, here's my A, B, and C. And I'm just going to go ahead and drop them right there. When you import geometry from an existing model, everything from that existing SketchUp model is dropped into a single container. So, this is a single group. I'm just going to rightclick and explode that. And now I have AB C in here with my deaf. And you'll notice tag A, tag B, take C tag all came in with that import. So, this is just how I had expected. Now, since the beginning of SketchUp, when you do this, something happens when you go through here to look at your scene. So, if I click on my E scene, D and F disappear, but these newly imported items and their newly imported tags did not disappear. They're still here. Same if F, D, doesn't matter which one I click on, they're going to show up the same. This is how it used to be. This is this is how it came in. If you're running 20 2024 or earlier, this is how it will behave. But with this new command that we have, we can update this fairly quickly and easily. So, what I used to have to do to update this would be come in here manually, turn off the tags I don't want, go to each scene, then hit update, and then go to the next scene, turn off the tags I don't want, hit update, go to the next scene, turn off the tags I don't want, and hit update. Not terrible, not like a mind-numbing process, but this is a pretty simple version, right? because I have three scenes and three extra tags. So, it would take me about, you know, a dozen clicks or so, something like that. Now, imagine if the model you imported had 36 different tags and they were all interspersed mixed through your tags on your base model. It takes some time. So, we have a simple way to do this now. So, what I can do is I can come in here and turn off and select the tags that I want to change. So, I want to change the status of these tags to off for all of these scenes. So, I'm going to select all three tags. I'm going to come in here. I'm going to select all three scenes. Rightclick and say apply tags to scenes. This is saying apply the status of these three tags to these three scenes. So when I hit apply tags to scenes now if I click through D E F you'll see AB and C aren't anywhere at all because I told all three scenes at the same time don't have these tags on. So this is a huge timesaver. This especially if you one the thing that trips me up I do this all the time is I will go in I will be modeling my model. I will create my scenes. It's great. And then I'll go in and do some more modeling and create a new tag, not thinking about the fact that the tag I just created is now on all of my scenes. Fortunately, it's not a big deal anymore because I can select that tag. I can select all scenes and I can rightclick, hit that, and boom, that tag is now gone from all my scenes. I don't have any extra stuff. So, a great great tool. Uh, nice functionality, especially if you do importing or if you do like I do and don't always leave scene creation to the very end. Uh, sometimes you just can't. Sometimes you get excited and you want to you want to do it. Uh, or you might have tags like this which are view tags. Um, I'm sorry, view scenes and it doesn't make sense to leave those off because you want to use them while you're modeling. So, check it out. Rightclick, apply tags to scenes. So, it is a fun not fun, it's very useful. It's probably not fun. It's it's it's it's utilitarian, but it is a good tool to have. It's a very makes it very easy to go in and update that stuff. It's like I said, was a kind of a manual process. A lot of click click click click click, that kind of thing. But this is definitely a nice way to uh update those scenes if they're imported or created a or update those tags if they're imported or created after the scenes.

Most importantly, though, leave us a comment down below. Have you used this yet? Um do you have specific questions about this? Is there a workflow that you could see this working in? Let us know about that. Or if you have a different idea for a video, let us know that one, too. We like making these videos a lot, but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see. Thank you.
