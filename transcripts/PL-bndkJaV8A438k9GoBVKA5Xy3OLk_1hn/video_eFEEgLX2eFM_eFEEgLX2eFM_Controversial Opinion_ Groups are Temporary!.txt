hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to talk to you about a controversial topic groups are temporary okay so like yeah not killer controversial but uh I do want to talk about the concept of using groups for a little bit and then getting rid of them and how that works uh not all the time I mean groups are still going to be good we'll talk about when when to use groups when not and where you might just use them as tools let's take a look right now all right so first things first let's talk about General use of groups so groups we have videos on this too if you if you're if you're like what's a group uh that's cool no problem uh go ahead and go into our web or into our YouTube channel and search for groups and components and you'll learn all about them um what a group does primarily is isolates geometry so as soon as I go and start drawing I draw some stuff like I drew this this shape right here this board uh idea being that this uh metal maybe a metal piece slots into this gap on the board that's that's the idea here so if I wanted to when this when I'm done modeling this I would come in select right click make it a group now this group is isolated so that means I can take this piece right here I can drop it right here and then if I want to move it later I can take it away if I don't do that if these were just all raw geometry and I was to grab this right here pick it up plop it in here this is cringe stuff right CU then when I take that and I move it a it's all connected it's all stuck together this is SketchUp uh sticky geometry doing exactly what it's supposed to do which says two segments come in line with each other they join all right so I'm going to undo that and I'm going to put that back into a group and I'm going to put this back into a group all right so that I mean that's that is the fundamentally why we use groups right there but I'm going to propose an idea what if there's other reasons we want to use a group I'm say I'm going to put this one right here and then in this slot right here I need a similar holder that where the Height's the same but this this round piece for whatever reason is turned 90째 okay so maybe something sits inside here and I need one that goes the other direction so if I come into the group I'm going to double click uh that's another thing if you want to get in and change geometry in your group just double click don't don't be exploding that's that's not necessary there are times where it makes sense to explode and we'll see that but not right now so if I want to turn this 90째 um just kind of as a tip if I want to turn that around the middle of this cylinder if I go to view and I turn on my hidden geometry I'll get that dotted line and I can just kind of move my camera right above see here's the middle line so when I go to rotate I can hover hover till I find the middle hit the up Arrow to lock into that blue axis and then grab it and turn it 90째 now looking from here it doesn't look too bad but if I come down here and see what that did that was not ideal that was that is not what I want want to have be happening right here actually you know doing some cleanup here could be kind of cool but this is not the thing I want what I want is this piece down here similar to where it is before but with this turn sideways so I can't do that because undo of SketchUp sticky geometry what I can do is I can grab this I can rightclick and I can make it its own group as soon as I make it its own group look what happen it is now separate from this section below so you'll notice that it did duplicate geometry right this Edge right here these edges coming around here are both in this group and in this group that's cool that's awesome that's the way it should be it should be like that um but what's not happening is these two are no longer connected so what I could do now is I go through the process of turning this then putting it down rejoining with the bottom I'm going to take an extra step right here and group select everything down here right click make that into a separate group now realistically as long as one of these two pieces is inside of a group uh I'm good right because if this is in a group it can't merge anything down here so raw gam down here is safe I like to put in its own group because say I was to do something like I'll put this back down here and then when I go to grab this group for whatever reason if I like do a group select right now like this I'm not getting any of the geometry that's part of this lower group because I'm not selecting that group I'm dragging left to right using that solid group only things that are totally inside of that selection window gets selected this is safe CU I can't select it so not a requirement but something worth considering all right so I'm going to go ahead and take this and I'm going to use the handles oops wrong guy I'm going to take the handles rotate it around the middle 90째 come over here I'm noticing you can see that's off center right so I'm just going to move it to Center I'm just going to grab this and move it right over to Center have line up like that perfect um so obviously this geometry is not going to close up I got gaps and everything so like one of the things about putting in a group that's kind of nice is I can do something like double click and then just edit this geometry um right now obviously this geometry is hard to see because this other Shadow geometry is in the way but that's easy enough because I can go to view component edit say hide rest a model and now I can do something like uh let's just draw a rectangle from here to here delete this little Arc delete this little Arc and then uh if we go back up so I actually have a shortcut key assigned to high addressive model so I can toggle it over real quick with a a shortcut key I do that a lot when I model in groups or components I can take this and I can move it straight down and I just want that to kind of bury itself in like that maybe maybe I'll go a little bit further and I'll take this piece right up to the edge this thing all right so maybe that's what my holder needs to look like so the base is looking pretty good top obviously has an issue so let's slip let's uh flip over grab that okay so yeah I got to get this over here so I'm going to go to view again High address the model and I want to get this over here so there's a couple ways I could do this I could click here click here erase this erase this and I could do that each time around the half this half a circle uh but not everybody enjoys doing or watching stitching so much as I do that's what that's called when Stitch geometer together so what I can do instead is turn so I'm looking at right on the edge like this do a group select left to right like that so that I get just the lines of this Arc right here and watch this if I just go to move grab it slide it over then I can just hit delete and it's closed up so model smarter not harder as much as I would have enjoyed sitting there and clicking and clicking and putting all stitching all that stuff together uh that's probably a better quicker easier way to do it all right so now I bring these two back awesome they are looking perfect uh another advantage of grouping geometry as you work on it is if this is a solid tool or a solid group I can use solid tools to just put these two together this one right here is not solid so if I was to go in and try to figure out what this was I would probably want to take it looks okay from the outside I'm going to turn off go view hidden geometry and turn it off so the circles don't look quite so weird but if I look at this in 3D space this looks pretty good um so what I like to do if I have a problem is double click I'm just going to right click and hide the bottom face and see right away oh here's the problem I have this face on the inside delete that edit unhide last and now I got a solid tool and like I said because I have these two pieces I can select both of them go to tools just say outer shell that'll work just fine and there we go now I have a new version of whatever this holder is I can pick up in its group plop it right over here and drop it right where it needs to be and again it's still in a group now because for whatever reason odds are good if I was really modeling this this would be a component this would be a different component uh but anyhow the the the the object it sits in the container it sits in can be temporary so when I do want to do that it's a great way to isolate geometry and separate geometry from the rest of the model and let you do easy cleanup and merging geometry like that so again not saying all groups are temporary but there's a chance that you can use a group to temporarily isolate geometry and make edits like that uh yeah let me know if you've done this before let me if you've done something like let me know if you have a workflow that does this specifically or maybe something slightly different uh I'm not saying I have you know all of it figured out obviously but I love to hear what you guys are doing how you're using SketchUp and tell me like did I miss some is there a better way to do this is there a different way to do this if you haven't already please click like down below and obviously ly subscribe we create a lot of videos and you know about all of them including our live streams every Friday if you subscribe most importantly like I was just saying leave us a comment down below tell us what you think of this let us know if you have other ideas you think would make a good video we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
