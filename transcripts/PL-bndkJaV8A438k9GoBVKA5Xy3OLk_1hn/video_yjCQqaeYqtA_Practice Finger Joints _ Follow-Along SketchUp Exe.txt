Kind: captions hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around&nbsp; let's just do some uh a basic practice exercise together so recently I've done some videos&nbsp; that were showing uh ino's laser tools and&nbsp;&nbsp; what that does one of the things it does&nbsp; is create finger joints or box joints and&nbsp;&nbsp; that that led me to think this is just a good&nbsp; exercise being able to resolve that sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; thing and that's what we're going to do so follow&nbsp; along and let's practice uh some basic SketchUp techniques to start we're going to draw a&nbsp; box it the size doesn't really matter if&nbsp;&nbsp; you want to be precise let's say 24 in by 30&nbsp; but that's not going to matter one thing that&nbsp;&nbsp; will matter is make it a known height so I'm&nbsp; going to say 1 in and then select this group it and then we could do uh a number of&nbsp; different ways but I'm just going to&nbsp;&nbsp; draw in the blue Direction a couple of more&nbsp; segments now I could select any one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; or the corner segments and also make a copy but&nbsp; I want this to just be variable right no even spacing so when we have that I'm going to come&nbsp; in here and I'm going to push that back one inch&nbsp;&nbsp; right we raised our panel or at least I did one&nbsp; inch so whatever distance you used do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing and I'm going to add one more segment&nbsp; here and that way when I'm done I'll have uh&nbsp;&nbsp; same on either side so there that's that's our&nbsp; starting point and let's make a copy of this so&nbsp;&nbsp; we're going to copy this up and then we could&nbsp; use the move tool rotate grips or the rotate tool either way rotate a version vertical and then move&nbsp; it back back into place and what we want to&nbsp;&nbsp; do is change all of this um this panel so that&nbsp; it will match and we have the finger joints in&nbsp;&nbsp; here now again this is variable spacing and&nbsp; that's on purpose but the way that you can&nbsp;&nbsp; make this challenging for yourself is to do a&nbsp; couple things let me make one copy of this so&nbsp;&nbsp; we can do that for example in this version I'm&nbsp; going to pick a view let's just say this view&nbsp;&nbsp; right here and I'm going to resolve all of this&nbsp; without ever moving my camera now I am definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; an advocate that you should be orbiting often&nbsp; but if I move this back into place I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to challenge myself to say can I move this these&nbsp; pieces without moving my camera I should be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to and here's some of the way in which we do it&nbsp; it I can for example use push pull pull to this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Edge and then using a selection window and&nbsp; I can't really see but if I turn x-ray mode on&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see that I've selected that but this&nbsp; is also part of the exercise is to kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine your yourself being able to select a face&nbsp; using a left to right selection back here without&nbsp;&nbsp; even turning x-ray mode on and also say for over&nbsp; here we'd know that we'd get in trouble because&nbsp;&nbsp; back here we have overlapping so we'll have to&nbsp; do a little bit more work but the point is I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to turn x-ray mode on and start moving&nbsp; this now maybe I will invoke the red inference&nbsp;&nbsp; and and this uh I wasn't careful enough you can&nbsp; see my geometry is stretching so I'm I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to select this again check my selection move&nbsp; this into place I could use Push Pull or move tool so I've got all these pieces done um&nbsp; this one like I said maybe from here if I&nbsp;&nbsp; select all of this geometry if I look um I've&nbsp; got a little too much back here and and again&nbsp;&nbsp; my challenge is to stay in the same view so what&nbsp; I might do is grab all of this I don't want that&nbsp;&nbsp; edge so remove that edge and move this over and&nbsp; then from there I can grab this piece move it back or I might need to create new geometry in here but again it's this is not the best&nbsp; way that we would do this we would orbit&nbsp;&nbsp; around um as we'll see but the point&nbsp; of this hopefully is just challenge&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself to do something a little&nbsp; bit like okay this is not the most&nbsp;&nbsp; efficient way way um but could I still&nbsp; complete this exercise and I think to do this oh I've zoomed it in and out all right so I think we've got it by use this last&nbsp; one and we're done again the the whole point&nbsp;&nbsp; of that is to say uh can you stay in one View&nbsp; and challenge yourself to use inference locking&nbsp;&nbsp; to use x-ray mode to use uh selection methods&nbsp; and to be able to resolve that geometry uh in&nbsp;&nbsp; a you know just from one view just because it's a&nbsp; challenge just because it might introduce uh some&nbsp;&nbsp; things for you that you haven't previously&nbsp; thought to do or don't restrict yourself to&nbsp;&nbsp; one View and just say how fast can I do&nbsp; this well now that we just did this last one we might be able to use and inference lock&nbsp; to here then push pull and then grab this section&nbsp;&nbsp; move lock the red Direction push pull pull so&nbsp; challenge yourself how quickly can I resolve these and lock to here inference lock reference&nbsp; that face inference lock drop past and done but doing little simple exercises like this&nbsp; I find just to be really useful for improving&nbsp;&nbsp; your speed at inference locking your speed at uh&nbsp; making selections or even just making decisions&nbsp;&nbsp; on what's going to be a more efficient method&nbsp; of selecting a face with the move tool moving&nbsp;&nbsp; and locking it or using Push Pull turning X-ray&nbsp; on so that you can see through and make a good selection there we go it is a very simple example&nbsp; um like I said but I do think it's one that if&nbsp;&nbsp; you just for practice inference locking practice&nbsp; turning your x-ray mode on and off you can see&nbsp;&nbsp; that just it's really helpful to be able to just&nbsp; switch between locking manipulating geometry with&nbsp;&nbsp; the move tool versus pushpull um turning x-ray&nbsp; mode on and off we didn't explore the ability&nbsp;&nbsp; that you can turn your component and other parts&nbsp; of the model on and off based on your editing but&nbsp;&nbsp; that too so simple exercise but one that I think&nbsp; is worth this and other things just practicing&nbsp;&nbsp; simple things just to improve your efficiency&nbsp; and and make your speed and SketchUp better I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know what do you think is this uh is&nbsp; this a a waste of time or do you think you&nbsp;&nbsp; know what try it try it a couple times maybe&nbsp; you get better at at in sing who knows let us&nbsp;&nbsp; know what you think uh and as always let us know&nbsp; if you have questions or suggestions for other&nbsp;&nbsp; topics that we can cover we'd love to have that&nbsp; conversation we'd love to take those suggestions&nbsp;&nbsp; and make them uh real so thanks as always&nbsp; please do like and subscribe see youall next [Music] time [Music]
