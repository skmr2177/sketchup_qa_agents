hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around Let's uh re-examine the flip tool so many of you will know that in the most recent update 2023.1 there were a few updates added to a couple things but one of them was the flip tool so we're gonna look at the new functionality of the flip tool as well as just share some tips and tricks let's jump in so the flip tool um there were options for mirroring or flipping objects previously but the flip tool specifically made that so much easier it works along the local axis of whatever group or geometry you have so I'm just invoking the flip tool with the keyboard shortcut and um and and you can see how that works now you also probably know that you can toggle the flip command to work on the local axis as this founding box shows or the global access in case you wanted to flip it regardless of how you have rotated your object and you want to flip it according to the global red green and blue you can also flip let's flip a copy and stretched so hopefully those are things that you already know about and if not we we have covered some of those things in previous Skill Builders but what we want to talk about is that there are still cases where you're trying to flip or mirror geometry and none of these um regular axes will work but the new functionality we've added will allow you to flip about any plane in the model any surface at all so if I wanted to flip a copy of this couch in this direction I simply can hover over here I'll call it copy and then drag this out to wherever I want to mirror that about or flip that about it's pretty cool comes really in handy and just some you know specific situations but if I wanted this couch I needed to flip a copy around let's say the back of this well that doesn't exist but it's easy to got the rotated rectangle but click and lock that down now I can quickly flip this about that point uh or Surface so really great addition great update to an already phenomenal functionality in the flip tool love that the other thing I want to talk about is if I go to a top view and turn perspective off one of the things that is really nice is that the flip tool still works even though I can't see the red or green plane for example but I can still flip using those as a different example recently I was working on some drawer organization and so I had some tools and I can CNC controller various things and it just makes it really easy Once I have these drawn to be able to you know play with different configurations of how this drawer might go together now obviously we could use the rotate and scale um and move tools as we would previously but just having this as another option as a quick way to flip and move Tools around is pretty uh pretty fantastic that it works just even in orthographic view so I'm loving on that as well and that's it so just a few quick tips with the flip tool but I do really enjoy the new functionality that it allows us love that new flip about any surface functionality and I do use it quite often in plan view not just for organizing or moving things around but also in building shapes and and mirroring shapes uh that you know then we'll go back and push pull it's it's it's a great addition so let us know what you think let us know if you have found the new flip tool to be useful or other suggestions for how even it might be improved going forward we'd love to hear that and have that discussion as always please do like and subscribe and give us your feedback on any topic you'd like or any suggestions for topics we can cover in future videos and we'll see you next time [Music] thank you
