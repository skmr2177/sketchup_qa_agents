hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around let's combine 2D components with 3D components or even more versatile components so the idea is one that it's been around for a while of combining I could say 2D components and 3D components and then you put them into a nested component and turn different parts of it on and off via tags still I want to show how we can build that out and hopefully show a few tips if you are trying to create your own this is one of those things that can be used in a lot of different applications so let's have a look if you haven't seen these here's the basic idea so if I were to copy this I'm going to toggle stamp mode on and stamp this let's say a few times around this Hillside and we could take any of these and scale or rotate them but if we wanted to look at this from a perspective View embedded in this component is a simplified version of that tree as well as a far more detailed version so depending on what you're doing and what stage your project is at for your final rendering you can turn on the detail tree but for a lot of cases your your performance will be greatly improved you know with something like this and then of course you can also utilize a plan View so let's look at how we can create something like this okay remove a few of these and turn this off now the first thing you'll want to do is create something like this where you have added the tags that you need and you might get away with just two or you might add more tags than we have here we have three so create the tags that you're going to use and create a standard that you can use across similar objects that way you can turn them all off and all on when you bring them on bring them in let's create a version for this tree here now to give credit uh this uh is a tree as was the other one I found on the warehouse from this author so thank you and it's a lovely tree uh works very well but if we were to copy a bunch of these around turn Shadows on it would definitely slow things down so I'm going to go to a front view turn perspective off and let's create a simplified version and I will start with a simple rectangle that is basically larger than the tree and move it in front of the tree depending on your preferences if you wanted a very detailed uh and accurate representation of this tree or something like it have a look at a plug-in called Fredo portrait it will take a 3D object and create a 2d outline of it and then even cast the image back onto it so it's pretty remarkable but we're just going to use a simple like say simplified version so let me toggle X remote on and I'm going to use freehand to trace this now if we were to just start tracing let's say we trace this out this would be a problem because it's referencing back there all of the geometry of the tree however when I use the freehand tool I can tap the arrow keys to lock and access and for me that will be green so if I tap the left Arrow key now when I draw because I started on the surface it's staying in the green plane and it's going to stay on that surface so that's we're going to use that to our advantage so here I am I'm going to draw on this surface I want to be careful I don't start drawing back here on the tree but I'm going to start on the surface and let me Zoom about that far tap the left Arrow key and start tracing this now if you want of course you can take your time and create a far more uh detailed version or simple version whatever is going to work for you we're just going to create something like this another thing to know the freehand tool the new versions of the prehent tool you can change the segment count immediately after you've drawn a freehand curve I'm not going to do that in full transparency the build I'm using seems to have a little bug where sometimes that works and sometimes it deletes your line I suspect that won't be around for long but just so you know that's something that is an option that you can change the segment count I'm going to tap the left Arrow key again and add just a little more detail to and even though I tapped I think it didn't work so let me undo that make sure there we go I'm not too worried about the segment count since we're creating a 2d version anyway okay and tapping the left Arrow key but it's not always staying so I want to make sure that I'm getting that in any case that's the idea now if we look at this I can take this simplified version and I will just copy it or copy it over to the side but I've copied it on my keyboard and paste in place there we go now I'm going to make this component so I'm going to Triple click on that surface we just drew and make it a component I'm going to make this a base me component so I'm going to click always face the camera and name it something useful again whether you have a naming convention that correlates to your tags or not we'll just do something like that and I'm going to set the component axis at the base foreign let's create that and move it into position basically lined up the base of our full tree there and I'm going to move that to our tag which turns it off now I'm going to move this to our 3D tag eventually but for now I'll leave it alone while I create a quick plan View and to start I'll just draw a circle um we could just use a circle when I was going through uh architecture school this was a simplified way to draw a tree and plant something like this there's a lot of different symbols out there for drawing it and like um like our other version we could spend time and create detail or not we could use the freehand tool we could come in and just be sure we are drawing you just create a little bit more of an edge down here if we wanted to oops so I will select this and make this a component as well now I would want to set that up initially by changing the axis but I didn't just to show that we can still do it after the fact if I turn the hillside on it's a useful thing at least in this case because landscape often you're dealing with things that are not flat if we move this around up here we we could have a situation where half of our our symbol is buried so I'm going to raise it up you know just a foot or two some distance and if I wanted I can also draw a line down so that we have a base to place this at or even a line up to represent how tall the tree is up to you and then I'm going to right click replace the axis place it at that base yep let's change the axis and we'll move this in place over here and move it to our 2D plan and then finally we'll move this to our detailed so we'll turn these back on select all of the pieces and make that to do something more do create a better name than green tree but whatever your your naming convention will be and I'm going to again set that component axis somewhere at the uh the base here so that when we bring it in we're placing it where it's going to sit again if you're doing furniture or a doorway there's a lot of different ways you might use 2D and 3D components so you might change that up a bit but there we go let's take our two trees here and foreign so you can create your own library of objects um something that would be useful for the type of work that you do the turn perspective back on and now we've got our simplified version it's nice and snappy and our more detailed version and again use this in different ways because you know you can use this for more than Landscaping but depending on how you use it if you use it for furniture or vegetation just have a similar naming convention and then you can control all of these at once hopefully that was uh useful to you if you haven't seen that before then give it a try and if you have hopefully you have some different ideas of how you might approach it as always we want the conversations to continue so please let us know what other tips or tricks or questions you have or suggestions you have on this or other techniques we'd love to hear your thoughts and please do subscribe and click that like button if you so like thanks y'all see you next time foreign
