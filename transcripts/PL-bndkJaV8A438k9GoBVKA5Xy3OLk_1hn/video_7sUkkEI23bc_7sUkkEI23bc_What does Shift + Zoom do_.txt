hey guys I'm Erin and today we're talking about field of view and zoom and how to adjust field of view with zoom so yeah these are two overlapping commands I guess you'd say Zoom of course is moving in and out of the drawing while field of view actually changes how much of the thing you see it actually widens your view to bring more into the viewport or less narrows it um and some very interesting ways of how they work and some tips on how to take advantage of them as they work right now okay so I have this little this little room here and I'm gonna go ahead and just peek inside here and see inside we get in here I got a lot of stuff going on a bunch of shelves and some stuff some some cool stuff happening but it's really hard to see everything so I can't even if I look all the way up like whoops I back through the floor up did it again oh man I just have to pull out and try again this probably feels familiar right because everybody does this where they especially interior designs rough because you got this back wall behind you so this is where a lot of people end up like throwing uh you know slicing stuff with um sections or something like that so they can see inside uh there are some different options though this is kind of where field of view comes into play is you can play with field of view make it a little bit easier to see more so if I want to see more of this I might play a field of view so first before we jump into field of view let's talk about Zoom so Zoom whether I use it on the mouse and scroll with my I'm scrolling my my mouse wheel right now uh you could do that or with the zoom key or Zoom command you can click and drag up and down that's going to zoom in and out of the drawing now one of the things that's nice about the actual Zoom command over I mean obviously we tell people use a three button Mouse do your viewing you know your orbiting you're zooming with that middle button that scroll wheel the downside is my boss ratchets right so it goes click click click click and if you do that it actually ratchets your Zoom so you see that one step step step step step uh whereas with the command the the zoom command if I click and drag I have much more Fidelity over that Zoom you can see there like I could probably like it's about a pixel at a time that I'm moving in and out so gives you a much more smooth zoom and also a lot more control now the zoom is kind of a zoom but it's kind of also not a zoom because you're actually moving the camera you're or or the model I don't know what something's moving you're dragging yourself enough so it's not like sitting here with a camera on a tripod twisting the lens and having it zoom in you're actually more like your camera's on a track and you're rolling forward that's actually what's happening here because you can see as you zoom out all of a sudden now I'm outside now I'm inside now I'm outside so you're actually moving you're not it's not as simple as just like I said changing your your focus on a point that's further away now something to note uh as I do this so I'm zooming in and out uh with zoom it just Zooms in and out on the center of wherever you're looking right so I'm looking at this drawer about so if I zoom in and out I zoom in and out of that drawer uh it doesn't matter where I click to zoom in and out from scrolling is a little different because if I as I scroll in and out using my my middle wheel the the pixel that my cursor is over is the one that I'll zoom in on so just something to be conscious of so I can effectively kind of pan this way because I can zoom out at the top zoom in at the bottom and I'll slowly slide my camera down zooming in and out with with the command doesn't care where is it's going to grab whatever's in the middle of the screen and zoom in and out of it so that's zoom zoom that's how Zoom works I just want to make sure you know that you're actually moving the camera it's not a normal Zoom field of view is great command for like I said especially if you're doing interior design if you're designing a bathroom or something like that oh man this can be huge so what field of view does is it actually changes how many degrees my I can view uh and it makes it looks like stuff's moving right so as I move it's going to widen the field of view which means I can see more or it's going to narrow the field of view which means I see less if I get all the way down it'll take you down to one degree I believe and then it'll stop and one degree is just shy of you know parallel projection the other thing to note there we go let's get back in here is that your camera does move right so as I move this I just backed out the door so I was in here before and I just kind of went back out again not a bad thing but it's something you need to be conscious of so as you're moving here changing your field of view you might have to scroll back and forth to actually see everything you're also going to see some weird Distortion right this is it's like inceptiony at some point but I feel that's what field of view does field of view is going to distort the view to get more in the screen but like I said the important thing to remember is as you're doing this you are the camera is also moving just like with zoom so what what are you to do if you want to get that distorted view that you want you want to see more I want to see more of the room I want to see you know these shells on the side I don't see the top but I don't want to leave this doorway well glad I ask because it's the reason we're here so if I go to zoom so just the same Zoom I've been using right it's the regular zoom and you hold down shift on your keyboard and drag out it's going to pull back it's going to increase the feel of the view you can see it in lower right corner my field of view is increasing without moving the camera this causes a more severe Distortion it's really stretching everything out but I can see the whole room and I'm still standing right in the doorway so shift Plus Zoom is going to let you do that it's going to stretch out but not move the camera at all so if you're ever in a situation I said the big spot that this happens is interior design especially bathrooms bathrooms are tiny rooms where you barely have room to turn around and this is going to let you see the entire thing so I zoom back here far enough I can see all three walls and the ceiling and the floor from standing inside the door of this small room so hopefully that's something new for you guys um I I've used it for years and I really never even realized that shift Zoom was there I think I knew I it kind of sparked that little yeah I think I saw that once before like 12 years ago but it's not something I use regularly shift Zoom to change field of view without moving the camera is a great tool check it out try it out uh see what you think and like I said if you're doing interior design or working inside of a closed space it's going to be a big help for you if you like that click like if you haven't subscribed and if you have a friend share they'll appreciate it and so will we most importantly leave a comment is shift Zoom new to you what do you think of it do you have another command that has come to you that you're like ah I didn't know that or wow it's been a long time since I've seen that tell us about it in the command or in the comments tell tell us about the command in the comments all right thanks guys thank you
