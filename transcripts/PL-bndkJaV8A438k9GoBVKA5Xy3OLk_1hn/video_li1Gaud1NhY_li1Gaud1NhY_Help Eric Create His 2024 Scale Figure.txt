hey everybody Eric here and today I'm going to need your help picking out an image that I'm going to use for my 2024 scale figure so I don't always do this I've got a few scale figures here behind me from the past years but I do like to refresh it um at least every couple years if not every year so for those that haven't made their own scale figure uh it's a good skill to learn how to do not just the importance of why we use scale figures but of course picking the Right image for a scale figure tracing a scale figure making a component coloring all those things it's just a great way to reinforce your basic SketchUp fundamental knowledge so let's go ahead and do mine now I've got a few guys here this is U me from 2018 I don't know if it looks uh like me or not this is me from 20121 this is me from 2023 so again I'm skipping a few years but I'm going to want one to take the place uh of one that represents me this year so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of that that question mark was just my placeholder before I sort of look at the images that I have to choose from let's take a look at what I the decision that I made in the past so number one my very first scale fig here you can see a couple things number one is I didn't have help taking the photo so I went and took a picture of myself in the mirror so I included the phone in the picture second thing is you'll notice that I put my foot behind me and so when you have your camera up high and your looking down at your feet you're going to see that a foot behind you is going to look higher in perspective because that's how it works in a photograph now in this case it almost looks like it's floating though when it's a scale figure and it is floating because your foot is smaller and therefore um backwards now I tried to remedy this here in 2020 one I don't know why I wasn't wearing shoes that day but I wasn't and so here I am I did make sure that my feet were sort of equal with each other one was not in front and not behind only thing is is when you spread your feet out this far watch what happens when you rotate your feet and your shadow kind of becomes disconnected so may or may not be something that I care about so I went ahead and tried to learn the Le use the Lessons Learned um from 2018 and 2021 and I made one here with myself where I've got my feet together but they're not super far apart and you can see so when I move the shadow sort of stays pretty close to my feet and it looks like I'm standing on the ground even though it looks like I'm floating because the photo was taken from a little bit higher up but hey you know what doing my best here so one thing that you can see here is all my poses I like to put my hands in my pockets does that make the best scale figure I'm not sure let's see what we've got now to work with for my 2024 version so I grabbed some photos here let me see if I've got those open here I am uh hands not in the pockets if you're going to take a great photo first of all I want to point out number one maybe move some furniture in this case you can see I've got a chair blocking my feet now that's probably okay I can probably guess at what that looks like um number two I've got the camera placed on a counter so you can see it's right about my waist level so that's good because it's going to reduce sort of that looking down onto my feet that you would see if it was taken at eye level looking down of course you get that perspective Distortion this is going to level my feet out a little bit thumbs up I don't know maybe not the best pose let's do something a little bit more energetic well maybe not that energetic uh so this one's a little bit more Dynamic you can see foot in the air now when would I use this in real life if I'm going to use a scale figure in a project I probably want to have them doing something so me doing the jig or me doing maybe stepping up onto a wall or climbing something maybe that would be useful maybe not so again trying to get my hands out of my pockets here's my Superman pose on the waist um a little static I don't know again now what if I still go for a walk here I'm going to Walk Like an Egyptian I don't know who walks like this I was trying to do a walking pose it is a little bit it's not me standing still with my hand hands in my pockets so again there I am with my hands in my pockets and then the last one I did is I thought you I've never made a scale figure sitting down so I'm going to take a picture sitting down so here to keep this show rolling I'm going to go with that one let's go with sitting down so let's take this image here pop over to SketchUp and bring that in and let's see I'm going to drag that and scale it up now I like to draw flat on the ground so I'm going to go and place that flat on the ground one thing I'm also going to do is make a group I'm going to start by making this a group and I'm going to scale I already know from checking my scale figure over here that my head is about 10 inch tall so I'm just going to come over here grab my chin go to the top of my hat I'm going to type in 10 in and there we go now I'm drawing at sort of one to one scale now I'm going to set my camera to parallel projection because I want to be looking straight down then I want to go up to camera standard views and top so I'm looking sort of straight down next thing I'm going to do is open up my Styles and I'm going to come over here to edit and to face style and to x-ray now I have a keyboard shortcut for that so I'm not going to do that again just showing you that um I'm going to go ahead and turn this on to xray the reason for that is because it's going to make it easier for me to trace now I'm ready to trace one last step is I'm going to place this onto its own tag and the reason why I'm going to place my image onto my own tag is just because it's easier than freezing it you'll see in a second so now if I want I can just turn that on and off and that's just I can see my progress as I go so this is where I get to kind of choose what do I want to use I can use the line tool and then I can kind of see what's a straight line and then of course it's going to try to inference so I don't know if my arm is that straight I could come over here and use the arc tool and say well there's a little bit of a curve there it's kind of a slow way to do it uh personally I think um I actually like to use the freehand tool when I draw so I have you can't see it but I actually have a tablet display so I'm going to switch over to my little handy dandy pen of course if you don't have this you can freehand with a mouse freehand tool is over here looks like a squiggly line you can still freehand with your mouse it's pretty good it's not quite as good as when you work with a tablet but um if you do have a pen display then definitely use the tools that you have so I'm going to start with just the Outer Perimeter so I'm going to ignore all these inner lines like shoelaces and faal facial features and clothes and stuff I just want to start with kind of a pretty broad brush stroke of grabbing just almost as if I was doing a silhouette of just the exterior so let's turn that off and see how my profile looks you can see there's no face in there so that's okay I'm just going to go ahead and close it so sometimes there's a little air gap and I don't know where one might be but you can see just by kind of closing the line here the other thing of course I can do is um change the color of my background but I like my white background so I'm going to leave it somewhere in here I must have there it is I overlapped an edge so I just need to cut that out and then when I go to close this that should give me basically my whole body so I can erase those little extras extra bits so there we go there's my profile now let's go ahead and remove my arm bits so I'm going to go ahead and switch to the freehand tool same thing come in here grab maybe some folds of the clothes a little bit and that's it that one's done and lastly that one's done so I'm going to get rid of those I don't need those right there and then here it might be easier to switch to the line tool instead of using the freehand I'm okay just doing straight sleeves like that this is where I may also want to switch to the arc tool you know again I'm combining methods you don't have to do freehand the whole time just because I did it that for a little bit you know it may actually make sense to have a a little bit more accuracy by bringing in a different tool and same thing here I might want to do an arc on the chin or I might want to do a um freehand here I'm not sure doesn't really matter again whatever works for your particular scale figure and I'm going to just draw a straight line and let's see do I want to cut both ears off I'm not sure sometimes I just cut one ear off and not the other I might want to cut both of them off in this case and lastly I need to actually draw round out I'm going to freehand this part I'm going to do my cap try not to look at the my face as I'm drawing it I'm not sure what that facial expression is probably just hold still for the camera I'm just going to speed this part up just a little bit because I know it's running a bit long so I'm going to use the same thing that I've been doing just kind of maybe fast forward put some details in here close everything up make sure everything looks good make sure to erase any straight lines that I've got so that those don't show up if I want to put some folds in or if I want to put some details on the shoes I can do that and that's it now we're ready to put some color on it so I'm going to turn this off and I'm going to actually I'm not going to turn that off I'm going to turn my x-ray mode off and I'm going to move this off to the side and the reason why is because I can actually sample using the pain bucket tool from myself so sample maybe grab a skin color that's not the right color that's okay I can adjust it later that's a little dark so I might just adjust this now that's like me when I'm coming back from and there we go let's go ahead and try sampling that Jean color see if I can pick up a nice color jeans and Sample my shirt color again I don't have to use the color that I'm wearing here I can use any color that I want but um I can change it and be more creative okay and then we'll sample my hat get something like maybe that's too dark so we'll just lighten it up a little bit and we'll go with that for now okay so that looks a little bit like me now I'm going to turn it into a component so I'm going to select everything I'm going to group it just for now and Flip It Up 90° so that he's sitting straight up make that a component right click it it's going to ask me first of all what do you want to call it I'm calling this Eric scale fig 2024 and I'm going to say always Face camera and I'm going to say set the component axis so I want to make sure that the blue is up and the red is over if I'm if you have trouble getting this to line up at all so sometimes it may help you to orient the Orient the the view in elevation style so when you're kind of looking straight at it then you can go ahead and get just sort of a better way to do that so I'm going to say make a component always Face camera again I'm just going to say Eric shorten that to 2024 and set the component axis I want it in the middle and I want making sure that blue is up and red is straight across that way when I turn you can see that it's pivoting on that Center Point and if I turn my Shadows back on you can see I'm floating in the air here but that's okay because I have a stool that I'm going to put myself on so I don't need that anymore I'm going to turn that off and I'm going to place myself right over here on the stool and let's see here if that worked and let's make a component and place myself right there with right in line with myself now just to match the skin color I matched the one from the from before but I'm going to select all um on the same material and I'm going to grab that one and I'm going to repaste it and that way that same material is basically the same for each of my scal figs so there we go so that's it that's the process again I'm going to recap shortly here make sure you've got a good image to work with think about where the camera is taken picture is taken from up high Center down low think about where your foot placement is what your pose is what you're wearing if that matters you can always change it later and of course lastly you know use the tools at your disposal if you don't have a tablet you can always do it on iPad or you can do it using um extensions you can also use it using do it using native tools so if you haven't made your own scale figure yet it's 2024 it's we're a few months in get in there go make yours and um share it with us add it to 3D Warehouse I'm going to add mine here right after this video I'll add it to 3D Warehouse put it in the description below you can go download any of me from 2018 to today so thanks for watching don't forget to give us that thumbs up if you learn something new if you haven't already subscribed so you can get weekly videos and announcements and what's going on especially with live streams and with that I'm going to thank you and I will see you next time
