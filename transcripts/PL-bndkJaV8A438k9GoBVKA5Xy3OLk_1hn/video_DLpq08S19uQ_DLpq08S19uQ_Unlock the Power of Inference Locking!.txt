hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time let's do some inference locking uh practice [Music] examples I love inference locking I think it's always worth uh practicing and making sure that you can just sort of use all kinds of different locking techniques so this is set up to practice a few different ways both with drawing and the move tool that uh you can use inference locking now this is not hard to recreate or recreate something like it but if you want to follow along jump over to the warehouse and I put this file under skill Builder INF lock so uh you can download this file follow along if you like this file also has um if we zoom out here this roof example and we'll do this in the next skill Builder so this time we're just going to focus here let's jump into it and let's start here what we're going to draw is this shape uh with the line tool using these um blocks for our reference so I'm going to delete this shape and I if you're not at all familiar with inference locking this is not going to be a super basic introduction we're going to kind of move fast but the idea of course is that you can lock a Direction so as I'm drawing I can tap the right arrow key to lock the red Direction the left Arrow key to lock the green Direction and The up Arrow key to lock the blue Direction you can also find a Direction and hold the shift key to lock that and we're going to practice both uh you can also lock to a diagonal Direction which is what we're going to be doing as well so let's start here I'm going to start drawing a line and I'm going to start moving in the green Direction so let's say I tap the left Arrow key now I'm locked in the green Direction now from here I can lock and reference some of these points but what I want to reference is this Edge see the difference between the point and the edge I want to reference The Edge because in each of these cases I want uh this shape to merge into these rectangles so I click here and now I'm free to move around again well I can just click here here now if I hover or it already found it we get that purple line but I need to lock that to know how far to draw so I'm drawing here and I can tap the down arrow key and the down arrow key will lock a um a non-axis uh an edge so as I do that then I'm going to hover down here now I don't want the point I want the edge so I click here and now I'm going to start drawing back in the green Direction this time instead of using the arrow keys I'm going to start using the shift key because I find in some cases it it can be just faster so hold the shift hover over this Edge I'm not clicking hover click then click click hover and hold the shift key right so I'm not worrying about uh finding this Edge I'm hovering on it hold the shift key and that locks me to it and then move down here click move down I'll come back to this one in a moment lock the green find the edge click click click hover hold the shift key and I'm locked I can just reference this Edge find the green locked in the with the shift key hover click click click hover and this is what I I tend to call this pre-lock right I could hover on this Edge hold the shift key and I'm locked to that edge if I let go and hover on this Edge hold the shift key I'm locked to that one so I'm just hovering holding the shift key locking click click I love the inference locking engine in SketchUp absolutely love it now this one I just wanted this one is um perpendicular and I just wanted to show that the rectangle tool if I click here and hover here for a moment it is also another way to get an inference now I do want to be careful actually this Edge if I drew this the other way here here and then draw over I found that the midpoints really close see how close that is and and how it's kind of messing with my rectangle there so just something to be aware of if you're uh always always be aware that there are multiple inferences in SketchUp and and sometimes some of them tend to get in the way when you don't want them all right so that's that idea again just to emphasize again I can pre-lock uh which I like to do with the shift key I'm hovering over for example this Edge hold the shift key I haven't even started drawing but I can hover over this Edge click and now that point click hover lock click hover lock click so that's the idea is that you can do some really great inferencing by drawing and holding the shift key or the arrow keys or in some cases pressing the shift key and arrow keys before you're drawing now this is a similar exercise the difference is that I want to line all of these faces up with this surface so we're going to do the similar thing but we're going to be using the move tool so for example I'll start here and I I do want to note see how this is how your blocks if they were groups they tend to be like this right because you tend to draw a block group it and then rotate it but the axis is drawn correctly I purposefully if you look at these bounding boxes I purposefully messed up the Axis on some of these to force so that you can't use the axis Direction so you have to use uh this pre-lock but this one still is so here's the idea I grab this Edge invoke the move tool and then I can start moving from that endpoint and in this case I'll just tap the left Arrow key the green and again I want to be careful not to this point or this Edge I want to hover and lock to this surface and then do the same thing here select this Edge use the move tool grab that endpoint and I'll just simply tap the left Arrow key to lock because this one is on the green axis click and get outside that group and that's it's lined up and that's what we're going to do to all of these this time because we don't have the luxury of the left axis so if we were to do the left axis right that warps our geometry this time I select the edge use the move tool hover on this Edge and hold the shift key so I'm locked to that edge I haven't clicked to move anything yet so I'll click to move this Edge I'm still holding the shift key and click here now I can let go of the shift key and I don't even have to orbit I know this Edge is through here if I look at x-ray I can kind of Imagine where this Edge is so I'm drawing a left to right window selecting it use the move move tool hover hold shift click on my endo and now I'm moving that edge referencing the surface clicking to finish and then letting go of the shift key if you haven't done this before it's definitely a sequence that you're going to need to practice right so select move hold the shift pick the correct Point hover click and let go of shift you just need to hold shift to hold that lock the entire time but this is this is just good practice for doing that sequence and finally got this last one if you so uh if you're comfortable with it by all means turn turn on the x-ray mode so that you can see through I could hover through this now and grab this point but here I do need to be a little bit careful that uh you know what I'm clicking on because x-ray is on but this is what we were trying to achieve that we were lining all of these up with this surface using inference locking now this example is uh also very similar we're just going to kind of reverse engine engineer that in a couple ways so in this case let's say we use the line tool and I'm going to hover on this Edge hold the shift key and I'm locked to that edge now if I H uh hover on this surface and click I know I've started my Edge correctly now because this is parallel I could do something like hover here and find a parallel to that and again there's going to be multiple ways to do this so I lock that direction click and then maybe I'll just be lazy on this one and push pull this away but we can do the whole thing let's say over here here this time let's turn x-ray mode on and I'm going to hover see how I'm on that face hold the shift key now I only can draw on uh you know in um direction that will be on that plane so as I click here here and I'm going to keep holding shift and work my way through all these edges now I'll finally let go of shift but by locking to that surface I could work my way around one more example of that that let's uh let's have a look at let's say I hold the shift key on this surface so now no matter where I draw I'm just going to draw some random shapes out here that I know are going to be big enough but you see how yep I'm locked to that surface and in this case just to make things simple let me ungroup these and select all of these select this intersect with model and then a little bit of cleanup will get us and if we have some reverse faces which we do looks like we might even have a an extra face or two here oh yeah we we you see what's happened uh because I intersected that face it also intersected here which created that extra those extra edges in this case I'm just going to take these three faces reverse them and then delete that geometry and that's that okay so like I say uh in the next video we'll go ahead and Tack tackle this roof using not all of these but a few inference locking techniques but go ahead and you know try this out on your own I hope that um hope that was clear inference locking like I say is a sequence um you've got to know when to tap the arrow key or when to hold the shift key and to keep holding it down and it just takes practice if you haven't done it a lot if you're kind of old school you're really used to using the shift key and then once we introduce the arrow keys that will cover most cases but I it is useful to know both and sometimes it's a little bit faster to use one or the other uh so I find it's just it's useful to practice both hopefully you you got this if not let us know um if there if if this was confusing or if this hopefully made sense I know it's an abstract example like say in the next one we'll we'll do a roof a little more something a little more tangible uh but download that file if you want to to do this on your own and thanks for following along see you next time [Music]
