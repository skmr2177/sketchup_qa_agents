hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at how to use components to make complex looking models really quick we have made a fair number of videos on components and I think that the the you know we've talked about editing one you edit them all and uh keeping your model organized that kind of thing um but one of the things that they do is they do help you to create geometry fast so what we're going to do is in a fairly quick amount of time we're going to go from having nothing to having something that's logical step right but we're going to talk about like uh uh you know building out or or bolstering up a model quickly and easy using a couple of components and we're going to do that right now all right so the thing I want to create I want to create a building this is going to be kind of like a a context building maybe it's not a hero building but something that's going to look like you know it would be appropriate to be in the background of a model or something like that uh that sort of thing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with a rectangle I'm just make this like uh 40 feet by 40t and then I'll take that and we'll pull it up like 50 feet okay so in the realm of context uh I could have this build building on a street corner and you would know that it represents a building but it's not really awesome looking it's it's it's a square it's a rectangle and it looks like that the reason to go and put in a whole bunch of details on context buildings is because we want our building to shine and because it takes a lot of time and energy so what I want to do is come in here and maybe without spending a lot of time and energy still get this thing looking kind of cool so uh I'll triple click and make this into a group this is just kind of the the canvas for our components we're about to create and then I'm going to come in here and I'm going to put a window in right about that is height not not not Precision modeling by any means here but just uh something to look good right so all right so there's a window on the side there uh I'll go ahead and offset to get a sill kind of like that and then uh I'll pull that up and I'm pull the glass out slightly too something like that uh you know let's do this let's let's make the bottom let's bring a sill out like that okay that looks pretty cool pretty simple I'm grab that I'm going to make a component I'm going to call it a window and then I'm going to take a copy of that and bring it across to here and say I don't know divide by four yeah that was good okay so and then I'm going to take those four and I'm going to say we'll actually here as well move it up 10 feet and do that four times there we go all right so pretty quick pretty easy we have uh you know like a a set of Windows there um let's go ahead and take all of those windows and we're going to make them into a new component and I'm going to call this facade I'm going to take that component then and I'm going to rotate it I'm going to rotate it from the middle of this building this is a square on top so I'm going to go to there option to here say 3x that's going to put three copies on one on each side and the cool thing is because this is a component I can make changes inside of an individual window but then also elsewhere inside of here so a couple things we're going to do um let's let's go a little bit beyond what we have with this window let's I'm going to come in here zoom in and I'm going to put like a little rectangle like that and maybe we'll just pull that right across like that maybe we'll push this bottom section in a little I want to go all the way into the wall so you know it is a a fake thing setting out there okay that's kind of cool May I'll pull this out a little more or I don't know making geometry up and then let's do something on the top too Let's do let's do something like pull this up pull this out here in here get rid those extra edges and then maybe we'll pull this out and then I'll take this Edge right here and pull it out a little bit so I get a little bit yeah that's kind of cool um let's also grab these two edges scale those out I'm playing a little bit here I'm I don't have an exact vision for what I want but I want something looks little more interesting than just a rectangle on the side that's great and because I have a component again they all get updated let's keep going let's let's add some more things here let's I'm going to come in here and I'm going to put a rectangle here and here and here and here and I'm being a little bit half Hazard here but uh I'll pull each of these out just a little bit just to give the the look of that one actually came over a little too far so we push this one back like that there we go but look how quickly I've created more depth and interest on my building um this is I I get this is looking a little bit slap Dash but you get the you get the idea so quick and easy way to do that the other thing I can do I'm going to exit out one layer so I'm still in the big component so in the big component I can do something like this come in here I'm going to draw a rectangle like that I'm going to pull that out that far pull that over this far and then uh I'll option pull this up like this make this a little bit deep get option pull that out like that pull this over like this and then pretty quick and easy you know just did that we did it on one side and then it shows up on all the other sides if I want to clean that up I can always come in here shift and erase a couple of these extra edges like this to make it look like they connect back together that looks pretty cool that's pretty quick pretty easy um let's take that just a little bit further I'm going to come in here and uh I'm going to come into this window I'm actually going to move this over a little bit more and move this over here like this because I want to put something down the corners here um that guy back too and then come in here again outside of the window I'm just in the in the main piece here and I'm going to draw a rectangle that is draw a rectangle not a line not an edge rectangle that big and then a rectangle that big pull this one oops reverse my faces reverse faces and then I'm going to pull this one out this far this one's going to come out not quite as far and then I will take that and I want to put that over on the other side so what I need to do is I'm going to draw an edge like this draw a line straight down and then back up I have a 45Â° surface so I can grab that I can say mirror that copy of that over to here perfect and now I can just pull this over here pull this over here and I do some quick clean up delete delete my extra edges that's always a good idea I don't need all that extra geometry and then what I can do is I could come in I don't need this anymore I could come in and make this a component I don't really need to do that though um I don't here go gra that again and turn off these extra edges right there um what I can do is I can say option copy this down to there and we want to do that like maybe I don't know 30 times 40 times there 40 40 was good and then come down here to the bottom and just get rid of this extra geometry all this and because we put it on the corner as a component oops I should I really should have checked the top of that quick better than I did um say here and say Orient faces get all those clicked back up but because I put that in in the the overall component on one Edge it did it all four sides like that so that's finished kind of quick I think the only other thing I really want to do is I want to add some additional some Randomness right because it looks very uniform but I mean here in just a couple minutes like eight minutes we got this all in here but let's go add some Randomness so not in the window group but on the outside in the the main component group I'm going to draw a couple of boxes something like this and then maybe something like that and I'm going to grab all that make that into a new component boxes and then I'm going to grabb move I'm going to hit my option twice to go into stamp I'm going to click here and now I'm just going to go around and on a couple of window sills just drop this in here not probably not in the same place on each one but like you know just moving around a little bit uh just to give it like I said a little bit of additional texture a little something else on there and I could do this with a couple different shapes but uh you know just two or three three shapes just to show something a little bit different so it's not perfectly the same on every side so now if I click out you can see okay I got all that geometry so not bad for less than 10 minutes of modeling we have what is I mean a pretty detailed looking model with some some depth to it I didn't even do colors in here but we could have done the same thing we could have put initial base coat here and I could have different brick colors it could have done Windows um but you can see just how quick components make something like an extruded rectangle look like a complete building so that's something that works I mean we did it for like I said it's kind of a context probably wouldn't be a hero building but maybe something you know out next to your your main hero building something like that but you can use components to quickly take details and repeat them so any situation you have where you have repeating geometry components can make it real easy to make that happen fast um this happened like said we did this in the context of a building and some architectural model or or urban planning or something like that but there's lots of examples of how you could do that in other things any place where something repeats components are a great way to make short work of modeling um if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below how do you use components have you used components for something like this what are other use cases that you think something like this would help where you could go in and quickly create a bunch of geometry using components one time uh I would love to hear that or and if you have another idea that you think would make a good video something we haven't covered or something we'd like to see covered again let us know about that too we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
