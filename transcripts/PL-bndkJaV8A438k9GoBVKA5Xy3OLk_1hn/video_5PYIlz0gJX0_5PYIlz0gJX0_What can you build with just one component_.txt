hey everybody Eric here and today I want to show you how to build kind of a complex looking model like you see behind me here using just a single component so first of all why would you want to do that and the answer is you might not want to um using a single component has some advantages and some disadvantages more than anything I think this is kind of a really quick way to play around with ideas so to build something conceptual but also for me to sort of practice my skills with using inferencing snapping the move copy so I think it helps if I show you instead of tell you so let's just get in and let's sort of build some more elements to this building that I started and uh you'll see what I'm talking about so let's do it so this is my model I just wanted to kind of show you really quick um I wanted to kind of prove to you this was all done using just just a single Cube component so there's my component if I open up my components window you can see I'm in Model and that was an old one so if I go model info Purge unused there you go so there it is I've got just my person or my people here and I've got just this Cube which you see it's already sitting here so I'm going to delete that anyway that's it just one component let's go take it a step further and if I actually go into that component and I modify it I'm just going to use the nonlinear scale by vertical and you can see you get something a little cool but not exactly what I was intending so when I say you may not want to do this method you're probably thinking exactly why would you want to do that well you wouldn't want to modify the inside of a component um because what you're going to do it's going to modify it to everything instead what we do is we modify the outside of the component so let me do a little example off to the side here I'm going to pull this Cube over this is again that same Cube and I'm going to practice like I said we're going to use you can use uh the icons if you're an icon user I am a keyboard shortcut user so M for move and I'm going to hit option or control to make that copy so that's that modifier so this is what you're going to see is I'm doing the same thing over and over again I'm just grabbing this Cube I'm making a copy of it and then I get to decide what I want to do I can scale it from the side or I can squish it and make it thinner or I can pull it and make it bigger make it taller or I can grab it from the corner and do a uniform scale and then again hitting that same option alt I'm going to modify that to create a uh uniform scale but from the center point instead of from The Edge so that's what that modifier does so this is really cool um in this case then what I could do is just use this scale tool and then just if I need to I can use I can turn on my x-ray mode so I can grab a grip one of these grips that I can't see and I just snap it to that geometry that's already there now if I wanted to if I knew exactly how tall I wanted to and I didn't know what the dimensions were but I knew sort of I knew how big this Cube was I could say I want this to be five times taller so that's how big that is or I could go um seven times taller um so if you know a proportion that you're working with you can always just enter the number in that way in this case what I want to do is also grab I want to grab this Cube here I'm going to make a copy and then I'm just for I'm just playing around so I'm just going to divide this by S something like six no maybe too much divide it by four and so this is kind of cool because even you can do sort of these complex arrays so even with this Cube group now I've got something where I've got sort of different versions if I wanted something to be twice as big at something I could just go times two and again why would would you want to do this I'm not sure but if you're doing something sort of somewhat conceptual um or you're just building something like um spaceship parts or something like this this could just be a really quick way to create a little bit of variety again using just the the same component and I'm just copying stretching scaling rotating and having a little bit of fun I'm actually just kind of really thinking more about how something looks than again how big or how the exact dimensions that it should be so let's go back to this house here or this building and use something that's maybe a little bit more of a concrete literally example because I need the uh finish it out with doing the sidewalk so I'm going to grab my Cube same Cube just going to do the same technique that I just showed you in that little demo I'm going to turn my x-ray mode on so I can find a corner that's easy for me to snap to and then if I need to I can turn that x-ray mode on again I'm just using that with a keyboard shortcut and I want to toggle that uh I want to grab that grip and snap it in place so I'm using the building already the geometry that's already there as my reference I'm going to copy this over I don't know how many I want because again I'm not working to any sort of real Dimensions just say times 10 to see how far that gets me I like to work in even numbers and then there you go so I can select depending on if everything is grouped already and protected then what I could do is a really quick way to select all these is you could come over here and say select all instances so you can see every instance of this component if I'm using the same module for my score for my pavers I can just say select one and it'll select all of them I'm going to deselect that one of course that's my original and then I'm going to make a group out of this um and then from there I'm going to just stretch it into place so again I don't know how big that is I don't know how big it needs to be it just looks okay if I wanted to change that number of modules of course I can just I can change that by scaling it but I'm okay with the way this looks so I'm again I'm going to copy that we're going to kind of do that times two excuse me let's try that again I'm going to do sort of multiple modules so this last module here I might say like well this is where like the tree grates are going to go and sometimes you'll see a different size P so in this case all I need to do is instead of redoing that array I'm just using scale by the scale by the sort of nonlinear grip scaling along the red axis and then I just say 0. five which is half of my other one and I know that instead of 10 I have 20 in here so I can group those together as well and if I wanted to make that a little bit longer I just grab another one of those modules so that's pretty cool I just finished my sidewalk out again if I did want for some reason to differentiate the sidewalk between uh from what I see here there's two ways to do that if I just want to differentiate the color I could come over here and actually paint the outside of my sidewalk I going make sure I'm showing my textures and come over here and I could paint my sidewalk module there so again still one component if I CH if I edit it the whole model everything you know everything edits um but you can paint the outside of a component if you don't have any color already applied to it so some people say you really should paint the inside of the component of course if I go in and paint the inside of the component here like if I do this what it's going to do is it's going to it's going to um it'll paint everything that same color and of course maybe I don't want everything to be that color maybe I want certain things to be certain colors even though I'm using one component I can still do that just by painting um the outside of stuff if I wanted to paint this sign here for example I could just come over here and paint or I could paint the whole thing or I could come into the group and paint that sign let me make that a color that you can see there we go go so again single component um single component made every single piece of this model and I've differentiated it just literally by using only one tool which is the scale tool that's it I just all I did was just scale it and um I'm also just snapping it to the geometry that's already there or I'm using the measurements box to say how far I want it to go if I wanted to do that as 5 or 75 or something like that I can just create more variations of this same module using just scaling um by a scale factor and that's pretty cool obviously this is geometric so it works that I'm building a model that sort of um makes sense by just using a cube and rectangles and things like that you can of course go organic if you wanted to bring in two components and you have an arch I mean think about what I could do with just two components an arch and a cube you could do quite a bit so I'm I'm stripping this down to its bare minimum which is just one Cube uh but you can do you can of course push this sort of idea or this technique as far as you want to go and of course you don't have to stop there you can also make components of groups so in this case I can make a component and call this doors and windows and then now I have two components in the model I have one Cube and I have in this case and let me make sure that I'm actually snapping this to the right point point do there time 2 and you can see now if I opened up my components window there should be three in this model there is the people as before there is my Cube like when we started and now I have a new module which is a new component which is this sort of grouping that's created that I used to create the doors and the windows so again now I'm starting with just one component but of course I'm not going to limit myself to that it makes sense that I would make if I knew something was going to repeat like in this this case I wanted to move this window or if I wanted to scale this I could do this um having this be a component group because I know that it repeats is definitely sort of a smart modeling technique so I'm going to stop there because you get the idea uh the whole point is that it's a simple way to model it's super fast and it's also super flexible CU if you find yourself modeling and then you need to do something a little bit different you can always make a component unique uh and then that component is no longer going to uh if you have to go in and actually edit the inside of the component rather than the outside then it's not going to blow up your model like uh like you saw when I first stretched it when I first was playing around with that original Cube so the idea of exploding components making them unique painting the outside of them and of course adding more than just the single Cube you know it's a pretty robust process again not something you're going to build a house and then send it to construction documents but something where if you're building a stage set or you're building something for game art or you're just doing some visualization and you're just having some fun and uh exact dimensions do not matter this technique give it a shot so speaking of give it a shot give a comment below let me know what you think uh let's keep this conversation going on am I crazy is this stupid um I'd love to hear from you and your experience if you haven't tried it give it a shot let me know what you think and as always I'm going to leave you with a reminder give ourselves that like if you if you like the video if not don't um if you're not subscribed subscribe that way you get the latest content every single week that comes out and of course lastly thank you for watching and I'll see you next time
