hey guys uh I got called out by you on YouTube about this drawer and I got to respond okay so maybe called out is a little bit extreme uh but we did have some comments and uh some questions and some thoughts on how to do the drawer different which is exactly what I asked for at the end of every video so really there's nothing controversial about this but uh that image of me looking unhappy will probably be on the thumbnail I don't make the thumbnails but we'll see what happens anyhow uh I had a couple things come up questions about making the drawer one thing was called that I did something incorrectly and I'm going to address that absolutely another was a different way to possibly make part of the drawer we can check check on that and then another question about actually editing the drawer we changed the size of it how would that work so we're going to look at that stuff right now all right so this is the file that I have this is the actual drawer uh that I created in that last live mod or uh video um first things first one of the things that was mentioned was that I did the dovetails backwards not in that the dovetails were done incorrectly these should be these should work just fine but the direction of the doveet Tails going the wrong way that that meaning this piece right here and this piece right here should be the front and back and these should be the sides idea being that if this this whole thing was pulled by the drawer front the tension would go into you know where the dovetail strong is rather than right now it's going to kind of pull it out so let's take a look at doing that real quick um this is easy and and I absolutely I I went in I just started drawing I didn't think about how these what direction these were facing whatsoever so yeah this was not this was not correct I I fully own that one um so what I want to do is I'm going to take these five pieces spin them around and then resize everything so it matches the same size of the drawer so what I'm going to do is real quick I'm going to make a new group that's just that just the outside uh here I'm going to raise it up just ever so slightly so you can see all this is is a rectangle that's tracing the top of this drawer and I could go in and Note and write down the dimensions on both sides also but this is easier for me for my brain just making a quick group that is reference geometry is going to be easier than uh trying to go through and um remember what each side of the drawer Dimension is and then I'm just going to take these pieces and pull them over like this I will start by spinning at 90Â° and now when I look at these individual pieces so see these two are solid groups these are groups I didn't make these into components so it would have been a whole lot easier to do the work I'm about to do if I made these in components so we're going to make them into components to do that I'm just going to delete two of them I'm going to grab this one and I'm going to make a component and I'm just going to call this side a grab this one make it a component and call it side B this is not one of the things that anybody mentioned or said anything about uh I just wanted to point this out because this is going to make it easier to edit it one of the questions was how hard is it to change the size of stuff afterwards and that's that's what we'll look at and this is going to make that easier as well so I can take this piece and put it right back where it was by just option mirroring right there grab this one too same thing option or modifier key mirror different on Windows than it is on uh Mac of course all right so that looks pretty good so first thing I'm do is I'm going to grab all of this and I'm going to slide it over this way till it hits that piece then I'm going to take this piece right here and I'm going to slide it over just use a move till it goes there and now I can grab this piece right here and I'm going use scale there's a couple ways I could do this but I'm going use scale grab that middle handle and pull that till it slots right back into the middle of my slot there all right so far so good now what I have to do is I have to come into this piece grab this right here and just pull pull it out to here all right so with that we've made a square drawer so if if that was what we wanted to do we'd be done butt that right back up against that face all right but it's not of course because because life's never that simple I'll just be honest with you guys all right so let's here's what we got to do here I'm going to grab all of this and I'm going to move it from the final Edge I'm going to pull that back and just have that go to that right there click out of here grab this one move it straight back like that and then final piece right here so I saying there's a couple ways I do how to use scale last time this time I'll actually go into the entity or go into the the group Push Pull and just drag that right back to here with that we have now changed direction of those doveet Tails so pretty quick not not a difficult process and the same thing goes here for let's let's make a couple copies of this oh I just noticed I didn't never group that face oh man who was watching me wow somebody somebody should be paying better attention to what I'm doing all right so I want to do a couple different uh versions here so one I want to say is like how wide is how wide is this drawer right now this drawer is 1 foot 6 and 3/4 so I'm going to say we have one that is 9 in wide so so maybe it's a a smaller piece um up above whatever I don't know uh so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this piece and this piece is going to slide over this way 9 in that's where I want it that's the final width of the drawer that I want so I could do a couple things here so this piece just like we did before I could pull this back in hit it into the slot we'll do that that simple the other piece means taking these two and pulling them over just like we did before but if I do that right now right if I come in here right now grab this just like I did before slide it back look what happens great that looks good but if I look at all my other pieces oops that's not going to work so what I'm going to do before I move anything is I'm going to select both of these and hit make unique now when I hit make unique and two items are selected I knew have have a new instance now that is these two what that means if I grab this and slide this back see the other one comes along with it so these two are unique together if that makes sense they're unique at the same time which I defies the the meaning of unique I know but you know that's what it does so if you have multiple selected it'll make a new instance of those selected copies all right to get this bottom in here I'm just going to right click and just do a quick hide and then I can do the same thing I did before I can select right here scale I like working with like extruded rectangular shapes because you can scale everything everything is scalable I can't do that um so I'm just going to say edit unhide last and that's going to bring it back I can't do that with like this piece if I grab this piece and I hit scale and I pull it out I can't just pull this out cuz look look at watch my doveet tail down here on this end see how it stretches I can't do that unless it's just a pure rectangle like this and that's why that it's it's just so easy to do that all right so last thing I have to do of course is pull the face over on this drawer so um again my shortcut for this is just going to be to check okay it's a half inch so what I'll do is I'll just come over here and draw a half inch line then I'll grab again I can't I can't scale this I got to go into context grab all the geometry that makes up the end and then pull it back this way until I hit that line that I put in as reference I can click out erase that line and there we go so now I have a drawer that's half the size well let's say hold on you say but wait what is if the width is right but I need it to be shorter so right now we got a drawer that's this is 5 in what if it's supposed to be a 3-in tall drawer well let's do that so I'm going to do this a different direction I'm going to go right here first and I'm going to grab that and I'm going to drop that down 2 inch all right so that's my new front maybe this is like the top drawer in a dresser or something like that now as far as this goes so like I said because this is not a simple rectangle angle it's not quite as easy as going all right I'll just grab this top geometry and then drop it down 2 in you can see that's not going to work that's going to make a mess so what I'm probably going to have to do in this case is go in and chop it off two inches down instead now same thing happens here 1 2 3 4 all need to be made unique so that's not now four new unique pieces that's two unique pieces two copies of each so I'm going to come into this one right here I'm going to come here I'm going see where 2 in is oh look at that 2 in is right in the middle of that dovetail so I'm just going to go ahead and run that across like that push that across like that this may not be proper Dove tailing technique that looks awful Slim Right There we may have to clean that up but I'm going to come in over here and with this one I'm just going to draw a line like this and push that all across like that then triple click here delete it oops this is on the other one got some extra geometry there delete that and there we go like I said I'm not 100% sure if that's going to pass the doveet tail police um what I may want to do is something like grabbing this section and pulling it down yeah even another eighth of an inch oops I grabbed the top two I won't do that uh let's see what would be the best way to do this we probably hide the rest of the model actually we just got to move this one down so if I grab if I want to put an extra e inch grab that piece grab that piece just do do do both sides at the same time we'll drop it down let's yeah let's go down 3/16 of an inch perfect and then we can do the same thing here this is just going to mean selecting this piece and this piece and then we can uh unhide the rest of the model and that way we can actually use snaps to make sure everything's perfect and there we go so pretty quick pretty easy uh not too difficult um but that gives us three different drawers with proper dovetails and yeah sized in couple different ways so uh I think I got everything that was mentioned I didn't I didn't get everything was mentioned one of the other things they talked about we had a comment in the first video that said when you put Dove tails in the first piece and you overlap the second couldn't you use solid tools to trim that and that absolutely would work I didn't do that I drew lines and push pulled um because I did that's what happened so you could absolutely do that put your Dove tails on we've done a couple other videos just on dovetails so you could check those out too I think that was a solution I offered put the doveet tails in one use trim to cut it out of the second uh either way works but uh yeah there we go so I just wanted to point this out and say this is why we talk about we ask you for please do comment please let us know your thoughts on what we're doing um you know fill it in like like like go to comments and tell us your thoughts there's different ways you do it you have questions about how we did it um and we also got a lot of feedback on new ideas for videos different things to model different workflows to show so uh hopefully you guys will keep doing that because we love this we love doing this but like I said it's your guys' input that makes makes us know that what we're doing is worth it so if you haven't already done it do click like on the down below we appreciate that very much and if you're not subscribed and you've gotten this far in the video you should probably subscribe we create a lot of content you be notified of all of it if you subscribe and I've already ground this into the ground seems redundant uh but please do leave comments let us know what you think of this if you think there's a different way you should do it if you caught me out on something I didn't do right love hearing it like making these videos a lot like a more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
