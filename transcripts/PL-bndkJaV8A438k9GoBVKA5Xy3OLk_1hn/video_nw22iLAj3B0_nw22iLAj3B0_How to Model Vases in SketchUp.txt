hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look using SketchUp to draw vases or is it vases um well we'll do one of each we'll do a vase and then we'll do a vase and then that way you could tell the difference um this was actually a request from a viewer they asked if we could go through the steps of doing this which is really great because it is it's a it's a follow follow me technique where we take a profile one side of an item and we use follow me to you know Circle that around or follow a shape around uh to create a vase or boss one of the two um so it's not a difficult process but there are a few steps to it and let's uh we're going to take a look at how that works right now all right so I got a couple uh examples I was just kind of playing around with some shapes this a one with a lot of Curves this one with some straight sides on it uh see some straight sides down here too so uh let's just walk through the steps real quick so first thing you're going to do is we're going to draw a circle so I'm just going to grab circles and I'm going to click and just pull something out like that what I generally do then is I want to draw the profile so I'll come over like this uh just draw a rectangle actually doesn't have to be a rectangle but a shape that's going to you know a flat surface to draw on is basically what I'm looking for here so what I will generally do then is kind of come in here and using straight lines just drawing on the surface I will kind of rough in what I think the shape's going to look like so maybe something like this will curve out and then it'll curve back in and then go up and then maybe it'll come back out again I don't know something like that maybe and then what I generally do then is that's when I grab my arc and I start filling in my arcs and now obviously uh probably goes without saying but I'm going to say it anyhow the amount of uh segments you put on your Arc the more Arc you know the more segments you put on the smoother your arcs are going to look but all right so something like that and then what I'll do is I will erase my extra lines I'll be honest with you half the time I do this I'm I'm pleasantly surprised or sometimes disappointed with the way it all turns out so uh yeah it really depends uh what I'm going to do then is I if I if I was to use follow me to just follow the shape around the circle I'd have a solid piece but I want to I do want this open so what I'm going to do is I'm going to double click and then I'm going to hold down the modifier keys to get to my minus so I'm on Mac so it's shift plus option and I'm going to deselect most of these edges so all I want is the edges out here then I'm going to use offset to pull that line in like about that much and maybe we'll make the bottom solid so I'll draw one more Arc something something like that maybe there down there we go all right now get rid of this I got to round off this I I don't like this I want to do this I'm going to draw a circle right here in the middle pull it across and then just get rid of this that gives a nice round Edge on the top all right so now what I'll do is I'll grab this circle down here and I will say tools follow me because I have not put this up on my toolbar yet which I should cuz IED use it a lot and I'll just click on the shape and there we go we got a vase this ended up more of a goblet I went a little big on the top but you get the you get the picture of of how it looks um yeah so that looks looks pretty good it's not ideal though there's some stuff I don't love about it for one thing if I look underneath all of these have no bottom so first thing I have to do to clean this up would be drop another uh line right there close that up the other thing that happened is I got this segment right here another segment right here right here all these all these segments not a big deal because I can just select it like this and then I can grab my soften and smooth dialogue box which is for some reason over on my other screen but here it is and then I can turn on soften C planer and then get rid of those extra edges so that looks better um but yeah let's let's do better let's let's uh let's do that in one instead of any cleanup steps so here's what I'm going to do uh I'm I'm going to come over here and uh start with my rectangle let's do a rectangle first so I'm just going to draw my shape this is the that shape that I drew my profile on so roughly the same size and then I'm going to do this a little bit different because then I'm going to grab my circle and rather than putting the circle right here where it was before I'm going to drop down slightly and put it down below so you can see it's down below by putting it down below oh I should also mention the circle Size Doesn't Matter I think I happened to match the this footprint to the the circle it doesn't matter any Circle works by having it disconnected here it's going to eliminate this need to fill in the bottom all right so let's go ahead and I'm just going to go through very similar steps to what I did last time so I'm just going to draw up over I apparently this is how I think vases work they have a step like that it's going to come over here then I'm going to have it come out you do a big sweep like this and that's going to kind of come in like this come up and then I only want to bring it out part way not quite as far so same thing I'm going to do here I'm just a little bit differently though let's let's let's do this let's put a full circle here and a full circle here and a full circle here and then when we clean that up we'll get a shape that looks like that kind of nice something a little different and then I grab my arc and we'll bring this up and around like this um I think I'm going to not quite go with a full half circle something like that oh yeah good all right then go this way and then bring this up here and then same thing I'm just going to clean up this outside edge grab like that all right and oh I a little bump right here I don't really like that so here's I'm just going to draw a segment like that and just clean that up that looks better all right so same thing I did before I'm going to double click and then I'm going to deselect anything that's not the Southside Edge before I offset I'm going to right click and I'm going to say weld edges by welding the edges that makes this a single curve so I don't have to worry about doing stuff like cleaning up the the pieces after the follow me so then I can just say offset and I can put that in here oh we got some CR oh there's I forgot where I was snapping from got some weird stuff going on down down at the bottom because the way I did this uh double circle thing here but that's okay uh because I will again I'll come right here take that straight across that get rid that and then same as did last time quick half circle right here all right oops oops is here what wait not sure there we go all right I'm going to do this one more time I'm going to Triple click grab all those edges and then I'm just going to do another uh weld edges and then watch this so remember last thing we had we had we had bands in here all the way around circles around we had no bottom so this time when I select the circle down below tools follow me click the shape not only do we get a a much healthier looking vase this is a this is a vase this is actually a goblet these are vases over here there's a vase look at that thing that's sturdy you could park a truck on there um but see there's no broken pieces the bottom is is good we can delete that um actually I'm going to back up a couple steps because I want to do something here just as one more option we'll do that again so grab the circle tools tools Oh Come On Tools follow me click here awesome get rid that so uh I do one more thing I want to show this is this is the bonus uh rather than doing a circle let's do this with a different shape let's go to polygon let's put a six-sided polygon right down below here like that grab this shape tools follow me click the same exact shape and look what we get in that case that's a that's a vase with a long a if ever I've seen one that's just that's pure fanciness and maybe that's what differentiates a vase from a BOS these are vases these are vases that's that's the big difference um yeah so there we go so when you are doing a follow me to create a vas shape and this is we were using vases but this could be a wine glass this could be a coke bottle this could be um I don't know a specific building depending on what you're doing anytime you do this sort of Follow Me thing the thing to do is put your path down below so it doesn't connect that way it'll close your faces up that's important and then weld your profile beforehand that's going to give you nice Easy Clean edges like we got in these models right here so there we go not only do you now know how to do that in SketchUp but now you know the difference between of Bas and of OAS and that was that's a little bonus education right there I I threw that in for free if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment down below did you pick up anything new out of that you have a different thing you like to do when you create these kinds of shapes do you have input on base versus vase let us know down below we like making these videos a lot we like give even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
