hey everyone Eric here and today I want to share with you a few of my tricks for working with and editing images on top of terrain [Music] so when we have images in SketchUp first of all um that's something that we should all be used to or have tried once or twice but when you add images on top of train it can get a little bit tricky especially because an image that's been projected on top of a mesh it's essentially more than one image it's an image applied to all these different faces so what happens when you want to go in and make edits I want to share with you a few tricks that's going to make that process of editing or replacing images on terrain a little bit easier right now so what I've got here is well first thing I need to do is I need an image and I need some train so I've got my add location Tool uh up and running and I've got this kind of cool little Peak here and I'm going to go ahead and grab that so I'm going to select a region and I'm going to point out really quick that you have this ability here in at least if you're using more of a recent or later version of SketchUp that you can tile the boundaries of images and so tile boundaries now that's kind of important for a reason which I'll show you in just a second because that's going to be the resolution we're going to talk about resolution here usually you want as best resolution as you can but then that's going to come with some trade-offs so let's go ahead and take a look at that I'm just going to import that at the highest resolution that I can get for my little study that I'm going to work on might take a second that's okay and there it is now that is actually just the flat image so I'm going to open up my tag so we can get the terrain and we can get What's called the snapshot or the flat image and by default I'm just going to go since I'm going to make some changes I'm going to unlock both of those they come in locked by default and I like to move my flat image a little higher I like to keep that up above the terrain and you'll see why I just like to work a little bit higher so I've got both of those turned on so what I mean by working with images on terrain I want to give you an example in this case where I like this image but I'm going to be honest with you the the I mean I like the quality of the image and I like just sort of how it sits on the train but the water looks a little bit dark and so I really want to kind of edit it and have a little bit more control over the image itself now this is where it gets tricky this is why I wanted to do this video is if I turn from face Style with textures to face style which is called shaded you can see that what's actually happening here is that it's tiling multiple textures and I've also got my colors and model open already so if I sort of Select this one right here it's actually bringing up this image so that's sort of the part that's sort of this lower part of the um of the terrain and it's not just the terrain image that shows that's made up of multiple images it's also going to be the snapshot as well so even on the flat version you can see that it's the same we've got these multiple images make up this higher resolution and that gives us higher resolution now so here's what I want to do though I want to edit this now if I go to edit this the challenge is of course is that it's broken up into pieces so I would have to go in and edit each one of these individually now I don't really want to do that but if you turn on your hidden geometry view hidden geometry sometimes it's easier easier to see the lines when I turn the textures off completely you can see that there's an option here which I you know it actually took me kind of a while to I didn't know you could actually do this took me a while once I figured this out I was like this is kind of Handy and then you can right click it and this option doesn't show up unless you go back to the textured mode so I'm going to go back to shaded with textures because you actually need to be able to see the textures for this and with everything still selected I can right click and a new Option comes up and it's called combined textures so if you click combine textures what it's going to do it's going to take all of these moldable textures and combine them into one now if you're worried I'm going to say no I'm going to cancel on this for just a second because if you're worried about the resolution then you may want to say know what I need the highest resolution that's why I tile these images in the first place then you may want to be safe and just say well you know what I'm going to make a copy just as a backup so what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep this one there and you can see that's got my full resolution and then I'm going to come into this second one I'm going to right click this and I'm going to say combine textures and this time I'm going to say yes so do you want to erase the interior edges yes I just want it to be one texture one face and you'll see why because I want to make some edits to just one texture not multiple textures now in this case if I zoomed in here a little bit you can see there's a little bit of pixelation on the plants um so just kind of take us a look at the level of detail if you're zoomed out it looks pretty good but if you zoom way in yeah you'll see that it does pixelate a little bit because of that combining the textures and here's the one that's not that was um before it was combined so just a little bit sharper detail you lose a little bit of information if you do this that's why I thought well maybe I'll keep a backup copy just in case but actually I think right now for me it's more important to have them combined so now when I click my thumbnail or sorry when I click my eyedropper it shows up here in my colors and model as just one image so I can click edit and then when you choose to edit it it's one thing it's going to do is I want to choose edit a second time but before I do that if you haven't done this already I want to point out that under preferences applications you can choose your default image editor in this case I'm using Dolby Photoshop because I just want to make some color changes so I've already got that selected in this case what I'm going to do is I'm going to do that again I'm going to right click choose edit of the new combined material and then I'm going to come over here and I'm going to choose edit a second time it's going to send it automatically to photoshop for me so that's kind of cool it sent it straight to photoshop now here I'm just going to add a few correction layers in this case I'm not sure I think it's a little dark so I'm going to boost the brightness up just a little bit and then I think the color balance maybe needs a little bit less yellow you tell me I think maybe have maybe a little sorry not red um you know maybe just a little Greener a little Bluer a little less yellow I think that looks pretty good and lastly I want to really pop the color of the ocean so I'm going to I'm going to deselect the shrub here and I'm just going to try to select I'm trying to select just the water and if I was doing this proper I would spend a little bit more time doing this and I'm doing this pretty quick so in this case what I'm going to do is do one more and I'm just going to boost the saturation of the water up so that it's just nice and it's nice and happy so when I'm happy here I can do two things I can either save this image as and now if I knew I was going to make further edits or I wanted multiple variations I could do a save as and save that to something like my desktop or if I know I'm only going to make one edit I can just hold all of my layers here I can just merge them so if you go layer come down if you're familiar with Photoshop merge layers so if you're doing corrections as corrective layers as adjustment layers you can just merge it and then in this case what I would do is say file save and once I do that SketchUp Watch What Happens in SketchUp there you go it automatically replace the image with the new one I'm going to hide this this is our old one just in case we need it I don't think we do I'm just going to hide it but now I've got my new brighter happier image now here's what I'm going to do I'm going to show you that one more time and I'm going to show you because there's two ways to do this let's undo that let's say I had a Photoshop file and I want to make some other changes in this case I'm going to select inverse who knows maybe I just want to come over here and just take the saturation out it's all about the water in this case I want to just pull the saturation out from my rocks I'm just going to do another save as version instead of just merging that and saving it so that SketchUp automatically updates I'm just going to save this as a JPEG here to the desktop I'm going to call this terrain black and white and there we go so now I've got a JPEG on my desktop here that's kind of cool thing is if I had multiple versions of this I could just go ahead and Sample that again and instead of choosing edit and making the changes straight in Photoshop I can just load it from in this case my desktop where I've saved that black and white version so whether you do it straight in Photoshop or you load it and you have multiple versions either way it works now once you've got it in here I don't know whether you like the black and white or not I'll let you be the judge now the trick is is to get it on top of the train so the first thing you want to do is go into your group so go into your Image Group that was originally the location snapshot not the location terrain and double check it by going texture projected so what you want to do is make sure that the texture is projected and then from there we can sample this texture and then I would go into this group and it doesn't matter right now if it's made up of multiple images because what I'm doing is I'm going to replace all those multiple images and I'm going to replace it with just one image so I'm just going to grab that one and I'm just going to come in here and if I turn my textures back on and just give it a second and paste and there it is so it didn't Auto replace on the terrain and the reason why is because the train was still made up on the multiple images to me it's kind of always nice to work with a flat image first and then you make those adjustments to it you make that edit and when you're ready you bring that down or you pay you just basically sample and then paste onto that lower terrain and that's cool if I don't need that I can just toggle that off and now I'm ready to diagram or I'm ready to do some mapping or whatever it is that I wanted sort of this color or stylized image of my terrain that I thought would be cool for for my study purposes so that's it pretty quick I mean in this case you don't necessarily need to use Photoshop but you definitely want to have an image to swap it out with for example if you found a Terrain image from a different source and you just thought oh I like the satellite image I want to go back in time or I want to hand draw over the top of it to show my notes whatever the process is that you use where you want to bring in a different image or you want to make changes to the images that you have on your terrain this is a great process to use and also I want to think about and to keep in mind because like I said it comes at a trade-off you may depending on the size of your area you may have to use that right click combine textures technique or trick and you know you you may lose a little bit of pixels in resolution and ultimately it really just depends on what you're doing with the image and what is more important but either way don't be afraid to get in there make some changes and play around and have some fun make this terrain your own and with that said I will leave you with a big thank you let us know in the comments if you like this trick if you've used it if you didn't know the combined textures trick that's relatively new to me and I've been working in SketchUp for a long time let us know your feedback in the comments below and we'll make sure to read those and respond so thank you so much see you next time foreign [Music]
