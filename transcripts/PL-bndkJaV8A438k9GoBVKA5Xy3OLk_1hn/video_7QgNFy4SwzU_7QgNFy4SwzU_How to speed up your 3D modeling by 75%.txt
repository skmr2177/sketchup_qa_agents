hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to make a table with one quarter of the work um so we did a video last week on components and it was kind of just a fun little thing you know use components to make a snowflake it was short it was simple and it kind of showed the way that that that works but I wanted to go a little bit deeper and actually make uh kind of a fancy if I can say that piece of furniture uh with a little more practical application right like how would I actually make you know some more advanced geometry and how would I do that and save time by using components and we're going to talk about that right now all right so there's a couple ways to do this I could just go in and straight up model one quarter of the table I want to build make it a component then copy it but uh I want to do this as I go so I'm going to start with uh a square on the ground I want to make a table that it's like 3T by 6t so I'm going to draw a a rectangle on the ground that's going to be um 3 foot by 1 and2 ft all right so this is a quarter of my table gosh this seems tiny now that I did that but uh yeah six it's not a really big table but that's okay this is still going to work um all right so I'm going to grab this rectangle before I have anything else else and I'm going to say make it into a component and this is a order table not a kind of table but a quarter of a table all right so now something real important is how I copy this right because if I take this component right now and I just say option copied over here and then grab two of these and option copied over here and then what I end up doing is coming in here and saying okay take wh pardon me Teddy if I take this geometry and I raise it up and then we're going to push pull it down okay so far so good but then I'm going to come in here and uh I'm going to put a table leg right here and I'm going to pull that down you can see oh that didn't work right because I took that same component and I copied in the same orientation multiple times so I'm going to undo a whole bunch of times to get back to just my one rectangle so what I need to do this is where mirror comes into play or flip so I'm going to say flip I'm going to hit my modifier key to make a copy so it's the option key on Mac and I'm going to drag the green AIS over so what that did was it actually made a mirror along this green s this green uh AIS right here now I'm going to select both of them and again I'm going to say flip hit the copy option come over to here flip that so instead of just taking it and moving a copy and then moving two copies I actually flipped it over flipped it o over you know so so these are all the same now all right so I'm going to start by let's drag this down give this table uh like a let's let's like an inch and a half depth here something like that that'll be good and then uh let's come in here and I want to put a profile on to this piece something you know fancy that's what I'm looking for is fanciness that's the name of the game with this model right here um so I'm going to put a little cup there I'm going to go grab uh maybe a circle and I'll stick a circle in here like this give me that really I'm just looking for a half circle something that comes out like oops and go all the way down there we go something like that I'll pull that up to here and then maybe we'll come out like this this that and uh let's put let's put you know what let's do this let's let's bring an arc back in like that and then we'll come back to the table like that there we go so we get rid of that get rid of that right something like that I'm going to take that now and I want to run that that around I only need to run on these two sides and say grab those two sides we're going to click follow me click the shape and there we go it goes all the way around you can see it in its Glory right there that looks awesome um let's do a little bit more on this tabletop before we throw a leg on here let's say I want to I want to do an like an inlay I want to change some materials a little bit so I'm going to grab these two edges offset I'm going to pull that in once and then I'm going to pull it in again like a much smaller like that that looks cool um yeah that looks nice so actually get rid of these two pieces and then uh grab all of it and I'm going to fill it with uh just nice deep brownish color and then we're going to have kind of like a lighter color inlay just for this this piece right here so I'm just going to grab this kind of golden brown that right there I know the question is going to come up I can already hear in the Forum where do you get the extension for these this is a Mac default color selection tool uh sorry if you're in Windows you can't have it all right let's put a leg on here now um actually here's what I'm going to do I'm going to come in here and make this a little more realistic I'm going take these two offset this in like an inch and then I'm going to actually push this piece back up there we go that's nice now we got a little skirt around there a little trim um and then our foot our leg will come down from there I'm going to actually create the leg as its own component so uh I'm going to start by just putting a square right here um we'll make it like 3x3 No 2 by two 2 by two there we go third TR is a charm I'm going grab that I'm going to make a new component and call it leg uh one of the reasons I did that is because it's going to make it easier to do things like put this in the corner and then pull it out and I can play around with this a little bit right so I can say uh come out half an inch and then come this way half an inch and then we'll drop that and grab that I don't know what I just did I just I deleted something I shouldn't have there got a little little excited about my my new leg so uh I think I push pulled it back up into itself that's what I did all right so I'm going come into the context of this I pull that down my leg length say like 31 in and then that looks pretty good you can see how as I'm doing this all I just have to do this one corner and then everything else follows along so this is really I mean if I'm doing just a if this was my leg that would be pretty easy but as I go in and I start to put a little bit more detail in here uh it's going to be if I grab this here actually let do this grab just the outside edge I'm going to double click to select the face and then I'm going to shift click on the face itself that's G me just the edges and then I'm going to copy that piece up to here what that's going to do is allow me to come down to the bottom and deform so I'm going to go scale and bring this back like this to make the leg long shorter or I'm sorry thinner at the bottom and see up at the top because I put this geometry in here it kept that it didn't bring that change size all the way up so I have this piece here and that looks good and you'll notice because of the way I did that again CU I mirrored and copied the right geometry is going on the outside it's super super simple all right um let's go I'm trying to think what else to do let's let's put a little bit of let's put a foot up on here uh so I'm grab this I'm going to move it vertically like uh yeah something like that and I'm going to bring it down like I'm going to option bring that down I'm grab this scale it back out a little bit and then bring that down to create kind of a just kind of a cool little just a little foot you know a foot that's it get rid of these extra edges I don't need those there because this is a smooth piece on the this side but on this side we got that transitions looks kind of cool all right and with that we're pretty close to having I'm going move this up to the origin so it's above above grade um pretty close to having a finish table the only reason I wouldn't call this finished right now is these ugly lines cutting right through the middle like this I don't like that so I want to clean that up uh I'm going to double click on one piece I'm going to go up to view component edit and I'm going to say hide similar components that's going to get rid of everything else and I'm going to come in here on the edge I'm going to go like this and select that's going to get me all those edges well actually first thing I'm going to do I'm going to get rid of this face I'm select got a little break right here select that face delete it same thing over here select delete it I don't need this little Edge between then I'm going to come over here grab these lines from The Edge see it's just those lines none of the others are getting selected go to empty info and just hide them all right looks good I'm going to come back in here do the same thing on this side grab those edges hide them and now a click out now it really is going to look like one big table so there we go we have our our terrible terrible color brownish green uh inlay I believe that's called Dijon um and we have our our fancy legs with our little fees on there uh our fancy edges and uh because we model a component on the corner those all came together so what do you do with this now well I do have some options I could grab all these pieces make it into a new group and then that group is now or that could be a component too is my main table um I could come in here if I know I'm not going to ever make any edits ever again I could actually select this and explode this all and make it back into one piece using components just to speed up the input uh it's kind of nice to maintain that separate piece because if I had to come in and make a change say uh you know I want to do a second inlay or something like that um I could do that now and uh I could do it once because the component pieces are still there those I still have those four different pieces so um yeah so there you go uh one quart of the work one whole table uh using components to model speed your process up quite a bit so this a little more PL practical application if you followed along last week and made a snowflake good for you that's awesome uh but maybe this is something you could actually use while modeling real things that you have to create whether you're uh you know making a symmetrical door or you know there's lots of things that have can be bisected or broken into quarters or even six or E depending on the geometry and if there's ever situation like that it's great to do that cut your work down um and one of the things that's nice about this is something like a table I probably could do the follow me all the way around it wouldn't have been a big deal but then when I go to place the legs placing each leg so that is half inch half inch off half inch half inch off half inch half inch off half inch half inch off so you had to sit through all of that so I could really make the impact of that lesson uh it speeds up the process so um yeah check that out if you don't use components already we do have some other videos you can check out on our Channel talk about components and the difference between components and groups that sort of thing uh but they are there for you to make repetitive input quicker easier and cut down on the amount of work you have to do so hopefully that helps you out if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below let me know how you have found components save you time when you're modeling and if you have an idea for a video that we haven't covered yet leave that down there too we love making these videos I even more I'm showing you something you want to see thank you [Music]
