Kind: captions Hey guys, it's Aaron, and as of this recording,&nbsp; SketchUp for Desktop 2025 just released, and I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to tell you my five favorite new features&nbsp; [Music] This is actually a tough one this year&nbsp;&nbsp; because, it's probably been said elsewhere, but I&nbsp; feel like this is the most feature-packed release&nbsp;&nbsp; that SketchUp has had maybe ever in terms of&nbsp; things like well I mean, like this — this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a SketchUp model right behind me. It doesn't look&nbsp; like a SketchUp model. Looks like something that&nbsp;&nbsp; got rendered, but it's not. This is just SketchUp.&nbsp; So you still have the ability to run SketchUp just&nbsp;&nbsp; like you did before. If I want to work with just&nbsp; plain white faces and shadows or whatever I can&nbsp;&nbsp; work with that style, but I can also work in&nbsp; something that has much deeper richer... I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; getting ahead of myself! Point is, there was a&nbsp; lot of good stuff in this release and I had to&nbsp;&nbsp; carve it down to five things that I like the most.&nbsp; And it was tough. I left some things out. We have&nbsp;&nbsp; other videos going out — Matt did a video that&nbsp; ran through all the release notes and everything,&nbsp;&nbsp; but these are my top five. Let's take a&nbsp; look at what they are right now. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp; number one is not actually a feature, but it is&nbsp; an extension that is available. And that extension&nbsp;&nbsp; is right here. Extensions / Migrate Extensions.&nbsp; What Migrate Extensions will let you do is grab&nbsp;&nbsp; an old version of SketchUp that you have installed&nbsp; and actually see the extensions that are in that&nbsp;&nbsp; version that aren't in the current version. So&nbsp; what this lets you do is—in a click—you can come&nbsp;&nbsp; through here and get all of your extensions&nbsp; installed. So, in the past I have definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; been quite vocal about saying that, "No I don't&nbsp; want all my extensions to just migrate over." I&nbsp;&nbsp; like the process of going through going, "Okay&nbsp; which ones" — going to Extension Warehouse and&nbsp;&nbsp; saying — "Which ones did I use? Which ones&nbsp; am I missing? What features do I need?" And&nbsp;&nbsp; then kind of bring them on because I end up with&nbsp; extension bloat. I end up with too many extensions&nbsp;&nbsp; installed, and being able to pick and choose which&nbsp; ones to bring over is super helpful for me. The&nbsp;&nbsp; nice thing about this the migrator is it actually&nbsp; lets you choose which one you want to bring over.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it'll bring you up a list it'll say which one&nbsp; of these you want to bring in and you can pick and&nbsp;&nbsp; choose which ones to bring, which ones to leave&nbsp; behind. It's amazing, and that's why it is number&nbsp;&nbsp; five in my top five list. All right, number four&nbsp; is kind of a funny one. This one this is probably&nbsp;&nbsp; something a lot of people will overlook,&nbsp; not notice, or maybe not even care about,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is some changes to the rotate tool. You&nbsp; guys have seen me use rotate a lot. I like to do&nbsp;&nbsp; things like I use rotate to make copies and to&nbsp; mirror things, before the the the flip command&nbsp;&nbsp; was in there. But I still like it. I use it a lot&nbsp; when I'm modeling, and some things changed with&nbsp;&nbsp; this version. So, one is I have the handles. So,&nbsp; see that by default when I bring this up I have&nbsp;&nbsp; center handles so I can center—or rotate off the&nbsp; middle. So, that's in addition to things like the&nbsp;&nbsp; corner points or midpoints of edges, that kind of&nbsp; thing. And, actually, just like—I have a modifier&nbsp;&nbsp; key just like in move—where I can actually tap&nbsp; and get the different spots to rotate from. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; here's the center of the component that I can go&nbsp; off of. Corners, edges, middle of edges of sides,&nbsp;&nbsp; then the middle of each edge and then back to the&nbsp; center. So, I have those snaps in there, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; super cool. The other thing that shows up is these&nbsp; little little handles right here. And I—these&nbsp;&nbsp; are normally in here, so when you go to move,&nbsp; right when you click and move on something you&nbsp;&nbsp; automatically get these handles. There's an option&nbsp; to toggle them off on move if you don't like&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing them there. I've always liked this because&nbsp; something like this where I don't necessarily want&nbsp;&nbsp; to rotate off a corner these handles let me&nbsp; move about the center which was really nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it was only in move. So now in rotate I have&nbsp; the ability to pick a point to rotate, and I can&nbsp;&nbsp; choose what direction I want to rotate as well,&nbsp; red, green, blue or if I want to set an axis&nbsp;&nbsp; to rotate, or I can just come up here and hover&nbsp; over a handle and I get that same functionality&nbsp;&nbsp; where I can just go right off of that point and&nbsp; then rotate there. It's a little thing. It's,&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess a quality of life less clicking kind of&nbsp; thing, but the fact that they've taken a command&nbsp;&nbsp; that I use so much, I like using rotate so much&nbsp; and made it so much easier to work with. Man, that&nbsp;&nbsp; gives—that makes—that's why that's number four on&nbsp; my list. Makes that so much easier to move. I get&nbsp;&nbsp; even more out of rotate. For number three, we're&nbsp; going to hop over real quick into LayOut. LayOut&nbsp;&nbsp; is something that—LayOut has actually gotten a&nbsp; lot of attention. There's a lot of lot of things&nbsp;&nbsp; in LayOut that are better—performance stuff,&nbsp; also you know hooks up to the new visualization,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a bunch of things that happen in here&nbsp; rotate, but my, that—again, I'm a simple guy. But&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that I like so much are the way that&nbsp; the modification tools have changed so I'm talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about move, rotate, scale. Move, for example, if&nbsp; I come in here, I pick this and then I hit move,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the ability to use the the same modifier&nbsp; keys that I use over in SketchUp. So I can say I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to copy, to make a copy of it, or if I want&nbsp; to stamp I hit the modifier key twice and now I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; stamping these things into place. This is the kind&nbsp; of stuff that I just—feature parity between the&nbsp;&nbsp; two programs LayOut and SketchUp—is so so cool&nbsp; because LayOut is starting to work more and more&nbsp;&nbsp; like SketchUp does. The inferencing and now the&nbsp; modifier tools with the, or the tools with the&nbsp;&nbsp; modifier keys. This kind of stuff is so nice. So,&nbsp; rotating in the old one you would select—I should&nbsp;&nbsp; point out that the old tools are still here. So&nbsp; if I want to scale or rotate using the grips that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm used to in LayOut I can do that, but if I'm&nbsp; used to SketchUp I can click on the rotate tool&nbsp;&nbsp; and then I can say rotate it just like I would,&nbsp; inference and rotate like I would in SketchUp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scale works the same way. I have the inferencing&nbsp; tools so I can actually pull off of corners and&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff like that. Just so nice to have what feels&nbsp; like the exact same tools in both programs,&nbsp;&nbsp; so that's why that's number three on my list. All&nbsp; right, we got two more that I want to take a look&nbsp;&nbsp; at, and they are both very closely connected. So&nbsp; I'm going to back up here and look at something.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's very noticeable if you're a SketchUp user, I&nbsp; actually have a skydome going on. So, the skydone&nbsp;&nbsp; is that 360° sky that's all the way around. Which&nbsp; is awesome in and of itself, but the cooler part&nbsp;&nbsp; is that it is actually connected to lighting.&nbsp; So you can see here, as I'm rotating this back&nbsp;&nbsp; and forth see that Shimmer? That light that just&nbsp; flickers and plays across the roof of my building?&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the environment and that is the lighting&nbsp; that comes from it. So over here we have this new&nbsp;&nbsp; panel called Environments, and it lets me do a&nbsp; lot of things. I can choose to have a different&nbsp;&nbsp; environment which is going to set this in a&nbsp; different thing and you can see not only does&nbsp;&nbsp; that change the skydone—I should probably come in&nbsp; here and, let me go turn off my ground plane real&nbsp;&nbsp; quick. That's why that's, it's covering up some&nbsp; of the goodness! There we go. And then back into&nbsp;&nbsp; environments and you can see as I click through&nbsp; here, again not only is it changing that skydome&nbsp;&nbsp; but if you look, see how the colors are actually&nbsp; changing on the model? That is all effect of&nbsp;&nbsp; environments. And there's—I did a whole separate&nbsp; video on this. We'll be going deeper into this&nbsp;&nbsp; in different videos, but I can actually change&nbsp; things in here. I can change, you know, where does&nbsp;&nbsp; that light come from? How does that skydone hit on&nbsp; there? Just amazing stuff that makes it so nice to&nbsp;&nbsp; work inside SketchUp. SketchUp functions exactly&nbsp; the same as it did before, it just looks that much&nbsp;&nbsp; better without having to go to render or anything&nbsp; like that. I get a nicer cleaner looking—not&nbsp;&nbsp; to talk down rendering. Rendering still has its&nbsp; place, absolutely. I'd still take this over into&nbsp;&nbsp; a renderer and take it into V-Ray and get some&nbsp; photoreal shots out of it, but as I'm modeling&nbsp;&nbsp; I can actually see closer representation of what&nbsp; this would look like in the real world, and that&nbsp;&nbsp; is why the lighting and the environments is my&nbsp; number two spot. Which, of course, brings us to&nbsp;&nbsp; the ultimate spot. The Final Spot. The number one&nbsp; spot and that, is you probably already noticing&nbsp;&nbsp; it, these awesome amazing looking materials. So&nbsp; if I come in here let's go drop down here and look&nbsp;&nbsp; at this brick right here. No, you know what?&nbsp; I'm going to do—let me do this. I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp; change to a more extreme lighting environment. So&nbsp; let's go ahead and hop over here and get something&nbsp;&nbsp; where I got a nice direct, a nice, I want a warm&nbsp; light. I want something to just hit this thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and light it on up. I guess we could look at this&nbsp; right here. Look at the roof right here. See how&nbsp;&nbsp; this is changing right here? That's because of—yes&nbsp; the environment—but the environment is playing off&nbsp;&nbsp; the actual material of the roof. So if I come in&nbsp; here and drill down into this material right here,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can actually change and edit that material. So&nbsp; if I bring up my paint bucket I'll get my colors&nbsp;&nbsp; window, and I'm, of course, on the Mac UI. The&nbsp; Windows UI is going to look very similar, but,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course, you know, Windowier. So if I look at&nbsp; the material that's on here, let's see, let's pick&nbsp;&nbsp; it. All right, so that's this material right here.&nbsp; You can double click on it, and this material I&nbsp;&nbsp; can actually change the material, how it works. So&nbsp; I can change the metalness, how reflective is it?&nbsp;&nbsp; If it has a roughness. In something like bricks I&nbsp; can look at my normal map and ambient occlusion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can actually take this material and change how&nbsp; it interacts with the environment around it while&nbsp;&nbsp; inside SketchUp. So if I have something like&nbsp; a brick, let's go, I'm just going to make, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to make something to look at. So I'm just&nbsp; going to draw a rectangle right here—I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp; draw two rectangles right here—and then I'm going&nbsp; to throw some brick material in here so I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to come here go into my brick and I'm going to&nbsp; drop some brick right on here. And then maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll go grab a nice reflective metal and put that&nbsp; on here and what that's going to let me do is,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I flick that around, look at that. Look at how&nbsp; that, see how that plays? So here on the brick I&nbsp;&nbsp; get a change in light as I go across but don't get&nbsp; a reflection because it's brick and it's you know&nbsp;&nbsp; it's bumpy and it's it's flat. But the metal here&nbsp; is shiny, so as I do that I don't just get light&nbsp;&nbsp; reflecting I actually get the environment. Look at&nbsp; that. I can actually see the trees and the grass&nbsp;&nbsp; in the skydome reflected behind me. And this is&nbsp; just the tip of the iceberg, like I said, I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp; showing you what it is, but this right here is&nbsp; why my number one spot for SketchUp 2025 is these&nbsp;&nbsp; PBR materials, these better-than-ever materials&nbsp; and how I can still—I keep hitting the B button&nbsp;&nbsp; instead of spacebar—that's me. That's not, I can't&nbsp; blame software on that one! But these materials&nbsp;&nbsp; are why they are my number one. Look at that.&nbsp; Look how cool that looks. Look at the material&nbsp;&nbsp; playing—that light playing across the material—but&nbsp; those materials are my number one aspect my number&nbsp;&nbsp; one new feature in 2025. So, like I said, it&nbsp; was hard to bring that list down to only five.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's so many more things that that I like about&nbsp; this new version but those five were, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; after consideration, those are the big ones. Those&nbsp; are the ones that that I'm going to be geeking out&nbsp;&nbsp; on. So as we do our weekly live streams here on&nbsp; YouTube come check that out. You'll see more of&nbsp;&nbsp; this stuff that we're doing right here. More of&nbsp; these features. And of course we'll be putting&nbsp;&nbsp; videos out every week showing, you know, for&nbsp; a little while here it's going to be focused&nbsp;&nbsp; really on how you can use these new tools to make&nbsp; the best looking SketchUp models you've ever made.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like that video, click like down below,&nbsp; and if you haven't already, please do subscribe.&nbsp;&nbsp; We create several videos each and every week and&nbsp; you be notified of all of them if you subscribe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly though, the most important thing,&nbsp; leave us a comment down below. Have you installed&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 yet? Do these features make you consider&nbsp; upgrading or purchasing a license? And if so,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have, did I miss something? Is there&nbsp; another feature that you think is better than&nbsp;&nbsp; my five? Because I'd love to hear about that too.&nbsp; If you have an idea of of a feature that you think&nbsp;&nbsp; that would make a good video tell us about that&nbsp; too. We like making these videos a lot, and we&nbsp;&nbsp; like them even more when they're showing&nbsp; something you want to see. Thank you! [Music]
