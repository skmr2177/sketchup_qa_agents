hey everybody Eric here and today I want to share with you how to create a sweet looking existing conditions model kind of like this building here behind me using just free images found online so when I say free images found online I mean that sometimes we need uh to build a building uh especially if we want to show a context building or something that exists in the real world and uh we don't really have CAD floor plans we don't have ads built drawings we just have an image of it so question is is how can we model from just an image and not only that but how can we use more than one image where do we get them how do we import them into SketchUp let's go ahead and cover that process now now I will say right now this is just an overview of the process because I'm going to plug a campus course that we've done that shows the entire process so right now I just want to kind of show you what are the three image sources that I can use to build a model like like this this is an existing building in Portland Oregon H it used to be a trimble office so I thought hey this would be really cool to see if we could build this and maybe do a redesign adaptive reuse who knows so the first thing I want to just kind of point out and this sounds obvious but you know I like to start with the footprint so in order to do that I need to go to plan view so when we go to plan view then when I say reference image I think it should be obvious but maybe not that I'm referring to this aerial image so there's different sources that you can get especially depending on version of SketchUp you're using but for me if I hide this and pretend like we're starting from the beginning this aerial image is really important because it kind of tells me some things it tells me where the sidewalk is tells me maybe where the cars or where this ramp is you know where maybe the existing trees are there's a lot of information that can be gathered just from the aerial so we have other videos on geolocation so I won't spend a lot of time but I will point out one cool feature I'm going to go ahead and say add more imagery because I've already kind of geolocated this model you can switch between a satellite photo or a street map so the difference between the two is that the satellite gives you more information I think as far as like the context around the building so the sidewalk maybe some cars an air conditioning unit some of those details that I think are going to be important to bring this existing space to life in 3D but the street map gives you some information that you don't get maybe necessarily or gives it to you in a different way like for example Le you get the building footprint you get maybe a parcel line you get kind of you can estimate better where the street center lines are so what I'm going to do is grab uh since I already have the aerial I'm going to grab just this regular map so you can do both you can go back and forth and grab both the satellite and the street map so I'm going to hide this for a second um what I want to do is pretend like I'm starting from scratch you can see here that if I was going to start from scratch this makes it a little bit easier to see compared to the aerial where my building footprint lines or edges are going to be now the aerial itself is taken it's a taken from remember the roof down so depending on how tall the building what you see as the roof may not be what's actually touching the ground so I do like get my building Footprints from this sort of non- aial more diagrammatic map view and then once I've done that let me go ahead and get rid of this don't need it that was just for reference once I've done that then I can go in and extrude my building and then start to populate out the pieces around it so that first piece of information here is going to be both the aerial and the street map that you can get from geolocation and if you don't use geolocation or you don't have access to it you can always bring in an aerial from a different place or you can bring in something from near map or placemaker there's other sources that you can get aerial information from Beyond the geolocation feature so definitely start that process there so now once we've got sort of that footprint here and we just maybe bring it up and we're ready to kind of start the 3D part the 2D to 3D part so what information can we work with here so this is where going down to street level in something like Google Maps or Bing Maps or Apple Maps and grabbing a street level view that you can then bring in to model from in this case I'm going to start with match photo so match photo is a feature here so when you import into SketchUp you can go import it's going to give you the option to use it as an image use it as a texture or this third option which is use use as matched photo so if you select use as matched photo what you get is sort of an interesting way that it brings the image in not as a watermark not as a texture but as sort of an overlay so you can see when I zoom out here what it's doing is it's fixing it's locking that image into perspective and then I can go in and align my models perspective like if I come over here and open up my matched photo panel you can see here is that it gives you some settings that I can then go in and turn the Grid on and off I can adjust these grid lines so I can basically match the model to the photo now I'm not going to go into too much detail on how to do that because we've got tons of great videos actually already existing that go into way more detail about how to get the perfect match photo in this case the point is is that you can bring an image in you can use it as a match photo and for example I'll give you an example why this is really helpful if I was to go in and place uh my utility poles you can see it's ma it's matching the perspective um it's locking the perspective of the photo so that when I go to place it I can just kind of place that right where I want it and I know that's going to be U pretty close to what it is in real life so that's really helpful for me so I'm going back and forth between my modeling view you know if I rotate I lose that match photo perspective I'm out of it and I can go back to that match photo I can bring that back in anytime so that was two that was two ways the plan view the street view as matched photo the third way that I like to do is now match photo is great but not every angle works for match photo especially if you're doing an elevation where the perspective you don't get that two-point perspective as well so I like to think about it as a watermark as well for those that uh have seen my videos before you know that I love working with the watermark feature The Watermark you can see when I zoom out here let me just go and toggle that section cut off when I zoom out unlike that matched photo it didn't zoom out with my model it stayed fixed and that's because this image is not being referenced in the model it's not being referenced in the match photo setting it's actually being referenced as a style so under the style under whichever style I'm have that watermark for you can see if I go to edit under watermarks I can turn the water mark off and on I can change the watermark from above the model I can switch it back to below the model so I can switch it you know the order of where I want it to show up and I can also go in and select the watermark and edit its transparency or or opacity settings so let me see probably better if I do that above the model where it was in the beginning and then come over here and I'll just change that so if I want to see more of the image I can see that but of course the line work gets hard to see so in this case I'm going to push that image back where I can still see it as a reference but um it's not super bright or super bold because the point is it's not for me to keep this image it's really just to model for so click okay and let me go back to that scene now I from this point on it's basically just moving the model and maybe zooming in and out and using the pan and zoom tool to sort of align this it's a little bit different method than if you've used the match photo before and again it's not going to be perfect and that's okay it's just a reference that I want to use to work so I know if I kind of look closely here I know that there's a tree well here I know there's a tree right here I can see that in the photo and and it gives me kind of a pretty close approximation on how to start so that's pretty cool so if I switch to my working view I can pop out at any point so I can switch kind of back and forth between the watermark view um and then I can switch to the working View and that pops The Watermark out and I can kind of see how this building is coming together or if I'm in the match photo View and I start I start using that as my reference to kind of align things and I switch back to that working View and as soon as I um orbit I lose that m photo and I get to actually start working on my model so I'm going to go ahead and pause here I'm going to wrap up to say that I built this entire building I mean it's not 100% accurate but it's pretty close and this was built using just those three images or used actually three images in three different ways so what I want to do is like I said in the beginning is that I'm going to go pretty quick because the point of this was actually to plug a course on SketchUp campus so our latest course that we've launched here as of the day of this recording is architecture building from reference so this process that I use to bring in these three images and Trace and draw from and reference it's all here for you step by step through a much slower Pace where you actually can download the files and you can follow along with us and you can go ahead and practice each one of these techniques whether it's the match photo method The Watermark method or the geolocation method and then of course we go beyond that where we go to 3D warehouse and we look at some other details that don't show up in the images and just kind of how to basically approach a process like this where you're modeling from just images so that was it that was basically three images brought into SketchUp three different ways and basically just using what I see in the images to model a building um that then I can use in my r renderings or I could use in a concept design or I could send off to um you know another team and then you can start doing some test fit exercises so whatever you the use is for something like this this technique obviously that's up to you but hopefully you found uh something in here useful uh take that campus course let us know there's a CH place to give feedback there as well so if you've taken it already let us know how it went if not go check it out at learn. sketchup.com and I will leave you there with thank you and see you next time
