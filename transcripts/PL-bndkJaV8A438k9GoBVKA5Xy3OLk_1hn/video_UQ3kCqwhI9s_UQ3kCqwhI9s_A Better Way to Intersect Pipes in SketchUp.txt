hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to talk some more about intersecting [Music] pipes so we have done a video or two about this um the interesting thing about intersecting pipes is that pipe models themselves can be solids right and they usually are they're they're they are in and of themselves manifold solids so you can use things like solid tools on them the issue comes in that when you connect or overlap to solids and you use solid tools on them there's Parts in the void that end up being left behind so it's not super simple and straightforward um but I came up during one of our live models with a kind of a quicker easier way fewer steps to actually intersect two pipes and we're going to take a look at how that works right now all right so just to to demonstrate what I was talking about here uh I have this and this I'm just going to Triple click make this a group uh triple click make this a group so now each of these groups are solid solid group solid group so what I would normally do here with the solid is take this one we're going to slide it in I'm going to slide until I hit that Middle Point right there and then with normal solids I could take those and I could do something like let's just take this one and we'll say uh come in and we're going to trim that where trim let's trim trim uh trim that to this one and what happens is okay that one worked okay because we got this piece so I come in here and I could grab this and I could delete this piece out kind of that kind of worked it was close uh the bigger problem happens when we go the other way in if I take this one and trim this one see this this is what I'm talking about is see the AP no matter which way we cut one or the other we always end up with this extra geometry so this is why it's not quite as straight forward as we'd like it to be basically um if I take this back over here uh I can't unfortunately again this is the struggle is now I can take this and I can say grab these inside and outside intersect this face with the model and that'll break that so I could come in here delete all these pieces out and then like this something like this and then we get rid of this piece out here and then when I'm done I'll have these two pieces directly overlapping each other but that delete these delete this all right and now if I look at this one I'd come in here here and I got to get rid of this this this uh let's see how that works that comes pretty close to covering it up um it's it's a mess right so it's it's not difficult it's just a bunch of extra steps I explode these join together reverse faces blah blah blah not the way I want to spend my time when I do this so like I was saying during our live model uh we were modeling a part of a bicycle uh the top of the frame where the handlebars come through and it's made of two pipes intersecting in a t and I realized there's a quicker way so what I ended up doing was just this so I'm going to take this first pipe I want to intersect the same way I'm going to grab the inside and I'm just delete just D all I did was double click on the inside that grabs the inside face plus the edges that form the top and bottom hit delete and I'm back to just a cylinder same thing here double click delete and I am going to Triple click make group triple click make group again just like I did before I'm going to intersect so I'm going to pull this across until it hits that middle piece this is just perfectly uh overlapping right in the middle and I'll take both of these and I'll just use solid tools Union or outer shell either one does the same thing in this case uh and there we go so if I look at x-ray this is just two cylinders intersecting perfect easy awesome now I got to make them tubes so doing the the inside tube afterwards this is where it saves me time so I'm going to come in here I'm going to offset uh two I'm going to pull this down to the bottom all right pretty simple pretty easy do the same thing here offset here double click do the same amount now here's here's the fun part because here's where I could have even more time saer depending on what I'm using this model for uh like in the case of the the bicycle I really just needed this to be through I had another tube coming in here and something dropping through here this would have been enough I don't actually need in some cases this circle this inside face to carry through and cut into this inside face in a lot of cases that might be it I might be done so that versus just figuring out how to get these two to even intersect I'm already finished now in the case that I do actually want that to come through it's it's a a te pipe or something like that where I actually need uh the the holes to come through maybe I'm 3D printing this as a connector whatever the reason if I do need this to go through not a big deal it's still less work than what I did before so I'm going to do is I'm going to use Push Pull again I'm going to bring it all the way through to the middle here so that this should tie in right to the end there Edge perfect and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a group select so I get this face this face and of course this face and I'm going to grab this face right here here so all the pieces that should intersect I'm going to select them all right click and say intersect face with selection and now it's just a matter of clean up if I delete this Edge and this Edge and I select this and delete it I now have two pipes that completely tie together I don't know why this isn't a thought that immediately came to me I guess I just had to do sometimes you just got to do the painful thing and and spend time hurting yourself on something before you figure that there's a more elegant elegant easy way but this cuts the steps in half literally half the step Pro probably less than half the steps uh by doing it this way um the reason again the reason this is an issue is because those solid pipes are solid on the outside voids inside of a space don't subtract from uh Boolean operations so I end up with chunks left over not a big deal pretty easy to take care of this way uh like I said not something I thought of before but definitely a quicker easier way to intersect than what we were doing uh with trying to use solid tools and then cleaning up afterwards so a simple trick yeah but something to think about and again we did this with pipes because I don't know why pipes come up a lot you guys ask a lot of questions about pipes on YouTube I'm not sure what the reason is but it's got a lot of pipe models out there and that's cool do your thing um but the this is something that could be considered for other Boolean or or solid Tool uh intersections if you're intersecting geometries where you have voids in them solid Hollow pieces inside uh it's something to think about does that solid piece need to exist before you do the intersection do these solid pieces need to intersect and cross over each other do I actually need to worry about that kind of stuff think about that as you do this uh because it might save you some time and some energy to add those openings those those voids after the fact rather than before trying to intersect the main sections so uh yeah check that out let me know what you think of that is there is there other cases where you've run into this sort of thing let me know about that if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you run into this are you one of the pipe guys who've asked questions before for let me know what you think of this or if you have another idea that you think would make a good video for us let us know about that too we like making these videos a lot but we like me even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
