hey y'all my name's Tyson today let's talk about 3D printing so many of you will probably be familiar with this concept but if you have not tried uh 3D printing what we're going to talk about is some tips for taking your SketchUp models to 3D printing software and 3D printers and just some General guidelines or considerations that uh that you should keep in mind so let's get to it so the first thing to think about when you are 3D printing is that you want to send a solid object to the 3D printer this is a pretty generic shape but if we look at the end of the info it registers as a solid group now if we went into this and just drew a line that would make it nonsolid now that line probably won't interfere if we actually exported this but there's a lot of things certainly missing faces that will cause problems so just keep in mind that you want to create 3D solid objects just make them groups or components if we look over here for example if I look at the x-ray mode we can see there's some stuff in here extra edges extra surfaces going on various ways to make this a non-solid so in the follow-up video to this one we'll look at some of the extensions out there such as the solid tools extension that will help clean this up but generally just keep that in mind that you want to create solid objects so that's principle number one pretty straightforward um the principle the second one that I want uh to show let me show that under model info my current uh default units are inches and if I export this as an STL file so if I export as a 3D model stls uh one of the default export options I want to go into the options and make sure that I'm exporting this uh as millimeters most of the software out there slicing software will prefer millimeters if you export as inches it might convert it for you or it might bring it in as uh you know um at the wrong scale because of this so I have found generally this helps just change this to millimeters and then test it out I've already exported this out let's have a look at what this would uh come across as now this is ultimaker Cura um I'm not this we're not partnered with them or anything this just happens to be a good allpurpose slicer but any slicer of course will do this same thing so our object is brought in in we could move it around on the bed but ultimately we're just going to slice this now there's a lot of settings in here 3D printing um you can go deep into the weeds based on the materials you like to use and and a number of factors let's just create a pretty generic pla4 nozzle slice and then if I preview this is going to give us kind of an idea of how it would build this up from the base and build it up with a lot of interior supports and that's how it would print and it would take nearly six hours for this particular print so let's look go back that's the basics you just take your model you export it as an STL file import it into your slicing software and then slice and send it to your printer now let's look at a few other considerations when you're in SketchUp creating a model these are both from some um Skill Builders that we did in the past few months this one was on a scill builder using boings if I were to create this with the solid tools a number of subtractive and additive Boolean functions at this scale there might be some problems as a I build it it might H result in some missing faces and here's another example of that if I took this model and I want to create a little bevel around the base of it so I'm going to select this surface use the follow me tool okay and I'll do the same in here and this example was from our follow me and we showed there as well that this is pretty small and there's some gaps in here when you're dealing with really small geometry SketchUp doesn't always resolve all of those gaps so you want to keep that in mind as you're building models so let me undo that now there's a couple ways to deal with this um where you scale it up I could scale this object itself larger by a known Factor let's say 10 and then I'd scale it back down point .1 but this is a component so I could also just make a copy of it move it over here scale up the outer version of this to anything and then I'm going to come back in here use follow me and by doing it on this larger version you can see that it actually works just fine but I'll delete that because it was a component it happened also on our uh real scale and it actually resolved it correctly this is commonly referred to as the Dave R method so we you know thanks as always to Dave for sharing this in our forums just remember that if you have a small object and you're having trouble with the details scale a copy of it or a copy of it if it's a component or scale It Up by some known factor and then scale it back down but things work better when bigger but you can still make that work for you so that's the uh the idea of Go Big all right let's talk about nozzle size by default and we're talking about filament fdm type printers here by default printers are going to come with a 04 mimet nozzle that's pretty standard it's a good balance of you can get a print done in a couple hours but also have a fair amount of detail but you can change those out for larger nozzles so a point six or8 nozzle so with that in mind that you can have different nozzle sizes you may want to build your models as some you know close factor of that and in this example I've got all of these boxes in this sort of grid system and the walls of these boxes I've made 1 mm thick and if you think about 04 a04 size nozzle then it will take roughly two beads of plastic to fill a 1 millimeter or at a08 size nozzle I could do it with one and fact that's what we'll see so let's take a look at this I've exported this out as an STL if we come back to our slicing software and ort that box right now I've got a point4 nozzle so if I slice this this box is going to take uh over eight hours to complete and indeed we can see why because it's got to go along each of these walls twice it's got a lot of infill to to do if I instead printed this with A8 nozle now we've cut the time in half and in fact we could go into the the settings here and reduce the amount of of filler and we could get this time down even lower but the main point is that with a one millim wall modeling that then I know I'm going to get you know one bead at 08 nozzle so just keep in mind that that you may want to keep your nozzle size and your modeling size and keep a relationship between them and for some predict some predictability when you come on over here uh and these boxes work fine we won't go into to the weeds of materials pla if you were printing this you might have some concern with separation whereas I've printed some boxes out of petg and had really good success but that goes into the weeds uh the weeds and the fun of 3D printing but there you go keep in mind that you can change the nozzle size of your 3D printer and you know use extrude more or less filament and that you may want to consider that in your model uh window another consideration with nozzle size is how much tolerance uh or how much space you need to create for your models and what I mean is this in this example this is a marker holder for a CNC machine so that this attaches to a CNC and this can move up and down and this holds markers and you can draw um it's not my original idea this is just my version of that idea not only do I want this piece to be able to move in this chamber up and down and we'd put a spring up here but also the print itself is not exact so I want to make sure that the wall of this piece has a little bit of room between the wall of this chamber and again not just for movement but also because the printer is going to have a little bit of variability so this was modeled with a little bit of space and it was modeled with a little bit of space oops here on the top so that once this is enclosed again it has a a little bit space to move here's another example of that if I move this piece in this piece slides in here but you can see it's not meant to touch the bottom here it's meant to have a little bit of space on these sides and then this would be a friction fit that that slides in here so again keep that in mind you need to model if you have interlocking pieces you need to model with some idea that you're creating a little bit of a tolerance because the print sizes are not exactly perfect and that will vary based on the Noel nozzle size um again a 08 would give you a little more variance that you'd need to account for whereas a point4 would be a more precise model but of course take more time all right now another concept to think of when you're 3D printing is how you send the file so let's say I've modeled this I could select all of these pieces and send this file over but it would come across something like this um this version we can see was broken out a little bit but I if when I exported I selected all of these and exported them as one file now I'm going to have to go through and it treats this as sort of one model and it it's it's kind going to be kind of a hassle to fix this but there's no need because I could simply have from the start either exported these out as separate pieces or laid this out and sketch up like this where they're all sitting on the ground and then I could export them all out and import them and that's going to work much better I don't have to fix anything about how this sits on the model another thing that uh you'll become very familiar with as you enter the world of 3D printing is the idea of supports and the idea that you're going to want to orient your pieces to minimize supports so this piece could go to the printer right it's going to be used like this where it's vertical but I could take it vertically I could take it like this I could take it like this and in the printer it's going to have to print supports for all those places that have overhangs so even at a point 8 nozzle let's slice this and in here it's not showing supports let me make sure that under so I'm going to say generate support there's settings for how much of that but this is this is what we'd be seeing in order to Pro print for example this overhang or the lip under here or this it's going to have to print supports to build up to it and as best you can you will learn to avoid supports not only because it takes more time and material but because you then have to go in and clean all of this out and uh and clean it up so keep it in mind as you're learning to 3D print that you will want to regardless of what your piece is supposed to be at the end which is this version this version is the best one for printing because it has it minimizes supports so I would export it like that all right one last concept that we can cover here and then we've dragged it out long enough it's the IDE a that often for 3D prints you will create little bevels and that's that's a great that's that's a really nice piece to add when you do you may want to consider whether you are creating angled bevels and chamfers or whether they have a radius and I apologize if I'm using my words a little incorrectly the idea of bevels and chamfers and radius e and all of this but let me show an example of why y keep in mind that for these bevels the you know the slope here is consistent whereas what happens for a radius is the slope starts to be more and more basically of an overhang so when we look at that in our software or as we prepare it for a 3D printer you see what's happening under here is we're getting farther and farther away even um we're being shown that this bead of filament is going to leave a gap here and a gap here and the gaps won't bind together and this this is going to be a problematic area of this print and that doesn't entirely have to be on an overhang it can also be down here as well whereas if we use just a straight uh ramp then we're going to have more consistent results now that's not to say don't ever use a radius it's just to say be aware of this and uh and you may not want to take it all the way or just have other considerations if we had more layers in here that might help remediate that as well just something to be aware of and to experiment with all right that was a whirlwind of throwing different concepts at you hopefully it was helpful though I know we didn't actually take anything to a 3D printer as you saw actual prints take hours to to go but once you export that STL file then you can slice it up and then from there uh run to your 3D printer so many possibilities 3D printing uh opens up it is a lot of fun if you are brand new to it prepare to be frustrated a little bit uh or a lot bit but the barrier to entry really is better now uh than even just a few years ago machines are far more reliable uh the price keeps coming down for better and better machines it's pretty fun but you will do some experimenting based on the type of models you create so just be that you know mentally ready for that with that said let us know um what you think about you know the three printing 3D printing in your own industry or your own world what you use it for um we' Love to have that thought let us know if there's other things that you want us to see in these videos and like I say hopefully in the next video we will look a little bit at some of the extensions that will help you prepare your models for 3D printing otherwise like And subscribe if you haven't and as always have a great day we'll see y'all [Music] later
