hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at rotating geometry with the move command so we are going to find out we'll spend a little bit of time this is kind of fundamental anybody who's used move knows that you get handles on there you can rotate with um but I want to talk a little bit about why you might do that or or where to where to put that in to play uh there's times where it's going to be good to use and there's times where the regular rotates going to work better let's talk about how those those are how those what's going to work where when to use what that's basically the point of the video so let's hop in and do that all right so I have a bunch of these models of uh plastic interlocking building bricks non-name brand uh and I want to take them and I want to I don't know maybe I want to do something like just make a little square out of them or something like that um I might take one of these right here and maybe I'll use the move command to slide over here if I wanted to copy it and just stack one on top of course I could always just hit the modifier key to make a second copy pretty simple but if I wanted to make a square where I had one going this way then one going this way then one going this way I'd have to rotate this so I make a copy copy it over here and I would use rotate maybe to come over here like this rotate at 90Â° and then I would flip back to move move it over here and I could work my way around doing that so uh yeah at that point I'd probably just copy this one and then put it over here but let's say I wanted to use move or take that I could rotate that um it's not a difficult process this is not a time consuming process this is not hard to do I'm just tapping modifier keys and then rotating a brick at a time tap tap the key back to go back to move and then put it there okay so simple not difficult to do but let's see how this would work if I just went into move right now I'm in move I'm going to grab this one bring it over here and now I'm going to copy it and this one I'm just going to spin using the handles when I'm in move if I move over a face I get these little red handles clicking on it allows me to turn it and then while I'm still in move I can put it right back here now a couple things about those handles when I rotate using those handles it's going to rotate around the center of that face so you can see it's not it's not rotating on the corner like it was before when I did it on the other side it's rotating about the center of this top face when I say center of the face I'm talking about the face of the object the group or component so if I come here you can see that red line that's representing where it's going to rotate from see that that's actually the center of this blue outline not the green rectangle so what I'm actually doing is rotating about the container it's not taking into account where there's geometry and where there's not so if I was to spin it I'd always be spinning around the middle so this is it's not it's I mean this is how it works it's not as simple or or it's it's not quite the same as how I would rotate with rotate of course because I pick a point pick a point to start pick a point to rotate to and then i' have to hop back into move now to move this back to where it goes so uh either way works but it there's there's just something nice and simple to being able to say okay move this and then we'll move a copy over we'll rotate it real quick and we'll move it so I never had to leave the command to do any of that and I'm I'm doing this a little bit in a drawn out way I'm probably not doing the quickest series of commands but I wanted to show you why that is a nice quick and easy way to do this um a couple more points that I do want to make about the rotate command one is that these handles only show up on faces you can clearly see right so I can hover over this little face right here this face right here I don't get handles because I can't see it very well it's tooo far away from the camera the tops I can hover over there I see my handles here I don't get them I open it up just a little bit more now I get handles the other thing that I hear a lot from people is that I don't like the the rotate handles because they get in the way of move yeah sometimes that's true so when I come in here I want to grab this brick and I want to move it I click right here oh I'm getting I'm hovering over the rotate handle instead of the snap point and that's irritating me absolutely my question to that my retort my comeback is why are you trying to move a brick from so far away zoom in come on get in here look it's just a scroll all you got to do is scroll that middle button and now I can grab any of these Corners I can grab a middle point here I can even grab midd Point here which is right next to that handle but because I'm zoomed in it's super easy to get to so if you get you don't these get in your way all the time just zoom in a little it's it's a pretty simple problem to to solve um but once you get in there once you get used to it doing things like moving components and rotating them using just move can be a huge timesaver and it's really makes modeling just that much easier so it is it's a small tip but I do want to say that these are the kind of things that start to add up when you're modeling so a couple weeks ago Eric did a Model where he used one component just scaled it all it was kind of a crazy example right it was something where well you probably won't do that but you could but thinking about things in how you can optimize your model is the key to being a faster more efficient modeler and this is an example of that if you get really good at using move with rotate you might not have to use rotate hardly ever and you don't have to move to another command to spin something and those are the clicks that end up saving time in the long run you cut your Clicks in half time in half every time you got to move or work with the component eventually that's going to show up in how long you spent inside of a model did you like this was this a good tip did this help you out did you learn anything here if so leave us a comment down below go ahead and like And subscribe too that's important stuff but really tell us what you thought about this kind of uh this this form of a tip or if there's something else that you come across a time saer that you know of that we haven't mentioned here leave that in the comments down below too we like making these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you than you
