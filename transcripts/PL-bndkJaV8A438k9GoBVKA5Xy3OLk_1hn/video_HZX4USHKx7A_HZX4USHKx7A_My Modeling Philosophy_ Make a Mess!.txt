hey y'all my name is Tyson and I'd like to invite you to sit with me and let's talk some SketchUp [Music] philosophy now philosophy may be misleading um I want to talk about kind of an approach to modeling that kind of bends some of the the typical rules that I think I think are good rules that I think you should you should follow where you're usually using components to separate most of your geometry uh naming them well that sort of thing and we're going to talk about an approach which is kind of sloppy a little messy um and why that might be uh something you use on occasion now again this is sloppy it's not best modeling practice practices but let's jump in and you can decide if this is something you want to use on occasion uh as an approach so let's say I am just designing some tables or some sort of furniture or something let's come back here this example is what you would typically uh hopefully see even this this taable toop is a component it's named correctly this is a table leg there's four of them it's a component and uh these stretchers so uh each piece uh is a component and if this table if we'd made something different from the front from the back we'd make that a unique component if we were making um let's say we're just you know exploring some ideas when we move this um out of the way we need to remember to make unique uh these components especially you know depending on what changes we're making maybe we are going to make this um a little narrower so we make these unique we move these back four inches grab the rest of our s you know pieces move those back for inches but what happens is uh something like this where I'll grab the tabletop also move it back for Ines but I often depending on the complexity of the model um you you may forget to make it unique and so now depending on how many iterations you've got you you've you've got some errors to to fix or or problems introduced now the correct approach really is to be in a in the good habit of of always making things unique when you need to make them unique but I I tend to at times uh take a different approach which is this table and this table is made up of basically a corner assembly so I don't have a full full tabletop I don't have a full stretcher I do have um a leg but you can see that uh I'm just got this kind of corner assembly and that alone um would create problems if the time comes to let's say break the model out into its parts so that we can start introducing some dimensions and and uh now we've got to rebuild this uh into its parts so it's it for that reason it's it's not you know it's not a long-term model there's other reasons why this could fail the other thing about this actually let me just undo the other thing about this that's a little bit kind of against the rules is if I go into my assembly this tabletop despite that it's in an assembly that it's component it's a group this leg is a group if I take this leg copy it paste it outside uh I'm editing it without making it unique because it's just a group sitting in there but that is also the point that is why I will do this sometimes because I want to make fast um simple changes and so I will take this approach typically in an early stage where I am just saying I I want to explore ideas more than anything else so I know I'm going to have to rebuild some of the geometry I know I'm not necessarily getting uh fully into um every detail or joinery but it's easy because all I have to do is grab my four assemblies and make them unique and then when I go in everything inside is a group so even though the assemblies thems elves I'm not worried about this piece that I just left behind because uh they groups inside now again that's that sort of works sometimes it sort of doesn't work sometimes that's I don't think this is a great design but that's the point so I'm coming in and saying you know what uh um let's make this whole thing two inches deeper and how's that look I don't know not great good that's the point I'm going to make another copy make those four corners unique and try again and and keep messing with some iterations here um so that's I let's walk through a quick um setup I this should make sense um as to how this uh is set up should be pretty pretty straightforward to understand it does break down the efficiency of this as you get more and more complicated or as your geometry is non-symmetrical it does break down and and will work or not and then you have to introduce kind of components back into the mix that you make unique Etc okay with that in mind here's a couple things if you do want to try this sort of um approach again messy not necessarily um you know just definitely it's it's best if you're you only model and you're the only one who's going to see this a year later and you're like what this is a wreck so if you're going to do it a couple things to keep in mind mind let's take this tabletop or let's say this one this tabletop in this case just um the legs down here are the assembly I do like having this assembly because when I say oh you know what I want to play with let's move that in two in and move that together one inch um let's move this back and um very quick to to move move and have the whole assembly move but the top here um I didn't include it easy enough to to adjust that if I want to say you know what we we want that top to be 2 in longer on either side easy change but let's let's set it up like we did back here one thing that can happen uh in general is try try to get your initial set up up um pretty basic so that you you're not always adjusting details and in this case if I wanted to make this top I can't simply um if I want to embed this top into this corner I have to now do something where oh I I've I've got to intersect with model because I've got this detail this chamfer down here or I've got to take the time to you know cut this apart so I may I I will have probably wanted to do this originally before I put that chamfer in there because now I have to go through and draw it not that it's that detail that hard but the more detailed this is the more difficult this would be to construct or to fix and we'd have to use some other stuff other method but let's cut that out paste in place another thing to do um if you're going to use this method that is really helpful is just be comfortable with hiding and unhiding edges so to visibly right this whole thing is is an illusion but visibly I want to go into this tabletop select these edges hide them select these edges and hide them and then turn my hidden geometry on and off set make sure you have a keyboard shortcut for that you can you can find it through uh the view menu or uh but it you're I'm not even sure where it is because I have keyboard shortcut for so long anyway keyboard shortcuts it it's super important because let's take these two assemblies let's move them over and now we want to extend the tabletop let's say I move that let me move it exactly 4 in now I want to extend this tabletop 2 in but I've hidden the edges so when I go to select these edges or this surface or to push pull this surface there's nothing to select nothing I can grab if I turn on hidden geometry I can go in select those edges move them by 2 in or later on if I needed to move these together again if I have hidden uh hidden geometry turned off and I go to move this I mean I can move it but I can't move it from this Edge uh so I it's hard for me to grab this I I may be able to grab a point but if I turn H geometry on though it's easy to grab that edge and move it over so with this method do become comfortable with turning your hidden geometry on and off and being able to select geometry and hide it or show it as needed but that's kind of that's the idea it's it's more of depending on how you like to work this may this may drive you crazy and and you like there's no way um that you wouldn't want to use names and and be more meticulous and and build out a full set of components but if you also just like to say you know what I I want to commit to creating six iterations six design different iterations that I can then take you know one of these and say this one I'm going to make you know this one out here and then this one I'm going to make a few tweaks on it is a quick way to go in and just do that just be non-committal be loose with I know I'm just take this and this and move those in another two Ines and take this tabletop move it out because we're extending the sides and now I can evaluate that it's not that it's that it it doesn't take a whole lot of time if you've set this up properly but it's just it's a really fast really to me sketchy paper way to do this um again it's not going to work in all situations it it but it can be kind of just an approach you take and then you get a mess like this but that's the point okay um let me know probably for some of you you're you're just like go let me have it Go type it out and be like this is the worst approach and you're going to confuse people and you have messy models and you can never share them with anybody because you've created a whole weird assembly of groups and components yeah all that's true all that's true um but I I like doing it for just iterations just fast iterations to me it helps me like I say just be non-committal and uh and treat this like a sketching exercise I do I I will I will have to spend time when I find one that I like to kind of rebuild it or fix it into a more robust model that's part of the process but that's why I say it's it's just kind of a different philosophical approach so if you hate it that's it's okay if you want to try it please try it if you have your own weird rule breaking scenarios let me know what those are because again SketchUp you you kind of can do a whole lot of things with it and you can get in a lot of trouble but that's up to you so thanks you all um do like and subscribe if you haven't and we'll see you next time bye [Music]
