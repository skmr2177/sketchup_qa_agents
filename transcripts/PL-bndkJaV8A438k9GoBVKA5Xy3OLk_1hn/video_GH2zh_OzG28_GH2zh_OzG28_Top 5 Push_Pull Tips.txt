hey guys I'm Erin and today we're going to look at top five things to know about Push Pull I can already hear it I already know Push Pull I'm sure you do and you probably know pretty good and you probably know some of these tips but we get questions on the Forum all the time about push-pull being used in a certain way and people being totally surprised to find out that there's a modifier key or that it push pulls geometry based on other geometry around the face you're working with so these are kind of things I want to jump into and show you right now so here's my top five things to know about using push-pull all right so we're going to zoom in here and I got two just simple faces they're just they're rectangles one was drawn flat one was rotated up so if I look underneath here you can see gray face facing down white face facing up so the way this works I'm gonna hit Push Pull so I'm just gonna click on Push Pull I'm gonna click and drag this up when I do that the bottom turns white everything around it is now the outside this is basically this could be grouped and become a solid I have six faces this is what happens with push pull on any face that is all by itself and now it does not matter so this is my first thing to note is uh this sounds like I'm peddling software here but use the most recent version there's changes that have been made to push pull in the previous few versions that make it so that you're more likely to get proper faces on push pulls so you can see I take this and I drag it down or I drag it up it doesn't matter I get a white Cube or box I should say box I say Cube sometimes and I mean box because all the sides are not the same but I get a white Cube either way that happens whether it's flat on the ground like that or like this right here this I have it at some angle to pull up this way or pulled down this way it doesn't matter I get that all white box either way so that is something important to notice and if you're using the most if you're using like 2018 19 you might have the situation where you pull it certain directions and it turns gray You Pull It other directions it turns white uh the most recent versions like in the 2020s are going to have this updated uh I don't know intelligence Push Pull is going to work gooder where it's going to actually make sure that this is on the outside to get white no matter what all right let's look at the second thing is know how Push Pull is going to work with connected geometry so this is that same square I had over there and all I have here is a little box connected to one side I'm going to go ahead and pull that up and we're going to take a look underneath it basically performs exactly the same so if I have just an edge connected or a single face connected it's going to perform the same way however if my geometry is completely connected to other geometry like this when I pull this up the assumption that push-pull is going to make is that this is on a surface of some larger geometry now remember it doesn't push pull doesn't recognize anything other than the face I'm hovering over so as I pull this up it goes oh I'm surrounded by geometry there's a good chance that there's more geometry beyond that so what it does is it pulls out of that surface and does not make a new face like this so the Assumption like I said is that this connected geometry has other connected geometry maybe I'm pulling this out of a solid or the side of a building or something like that push pulling or pushing in same thing if I grab this and push in I'm going to get this it assumes that you know maybe this is a countertop and I'm pulling a sink down or I'm pushing a window in regardless of the actual use if your face that you're push pulling is surrounded by other geometry it's going to treat it as though it is part of a much larger world and not just a standalone shape like we saw in the previous examples all right thing number three learn about your modifier Keys modifier keys are so important and yet it seems to be one of the last things people learn or or acknowledge exist every command you use in SketchUp is going to list some modifier Keys down at the bottom and they're going to change depending on your if you're on Windows or you're on Mac so I'm going to refer to them as the modifier for what it does rather than say click option because if you're on a Windows machine you're not going to see options it's going to say something else here so what I want to look at here is there's two modifier keys for Push Pull so first I'm just gonna do regular push pull on the Square same square again I'm going to pull it up into a box now if I hover over any side and push pull again I'm just grabbing that face and stretching out right this is how pushful works this shouldn't be a surprise to anybody this is what it does now if you hit this first modifier key you have the option to toggle create new starting face what does that mean I'm going to go ahead and tap it once you don't have to hold it down you tap it and you you'll notice you get the little plus right next to your your cursor there so when you pull up look what happens I'm going to pull another one out this way see that line there that's indicating that there's a new face there so let's go in here I'm going to go ahead and grab these three faces and delete them this is what that created so it's creating brand new faces and pulling that up as if it were a new Surface there are situations where you might want to do this if I'm creating some kind well I mean hey if I'm creating a unique cubby design like I just did that might be it uh if there's some issues we'll touch on later where uh Push Pull stops you from extending past a certain geometry you want to pull past you might have to create a new face uh there are situations where this might happen it is worth noting that as soon as I do this I'm going to go ahead and undo my delete this is not a solid shape anymore because it has interior geometry so if you do something like this and create that new face just be aware that it's in there so even though I can't see it I'll turn on x-ray even though I can't see it from the outside these two faces are in here so this is not a solid this could not you know I could use solid tools on this or anything like that because it has those new faces but if you're in a situation where you want to intentionally add that geometry on top you can do that with just a modifier key the other modifier key is a little I don't know a little more the use case for it's a little more obscure so if I come in here and we'll go back in a push pull uh whoops that was that's the wrong button let's try Push Pull in this push-pull video so I have this option down here toggle stretch mode so again if I just come in here and push pull this up it's going to do this right this is what just like we saw on that that previous uh example but if I toggle stretch mode on again I'll tap that to get a little icon little icon is a face with an arrow pointing away from it what that's going to do is grab that face I have and move it like it's push pulling but rather than push pulling and creating new sides perpendicular to the face it's grabbing the edges that are already connected and just pulling it with so those of you who are paying attention out there and use SketchUp may already have said this but what about move is that what move does if I click move and I start moving vertically exactly what that does so why would you use Push Pull with that modifier Cube rather than just moving well I don't know maybe this this is one thing so that sounds I don't know maybe this it's because of this like if as I use move I do have to make sure I lock into that vertical otherwise it can bounce off and you know connect to this other geometry over here on accident whereas Push Pull with the modifier key is going to only go just like push-pull only goes directly normal to a surface so does this so this is this is a case where you might want to use it it's probably not something to use a lot the one the example that I was able to come up with for this was if I was ever pulling geometry that I wanted to stretch and I wanted to go perfectly 90 degrees to wherever the face was I don't have an inference for this I don't have an inference that says go perpendicular just to this one thing I could create it I could come up with some other geometry to hover over and figure out an inference to make this happen I could put it into a group and reassign the axes but this push-pull with modifier is going to stretch that geometry and the connected geometry without having to create extra geometry inference and it doesn't matter what angle attack is just like Push Pull it's going to pull at 90 degrees to the surface that's selected all right we're doing good number four this is a thing to know is the way that Push Pull works with other geometry nearby so I have this thing got some blocks some steps I don't know what this is but I got steps here I got some steps if I go to pull this face up I'll have the opportunity to use snap to end at this this plane right here snap works you know just like anything else in in uh SketchUp I can inference I can finish the middle over here but if I come up to this right here I'm not going to go past it I can't inference up to this uh there is certain geometry that is you know fills the whole Edge like this that will stop your push pull from happening most people who hit this do here's what here's what most people do when they do this right so I click here let it go grab it push pull it again that works great so what you're trying to do is inference all the way up to this height I could do that with two push pulls super quick not a real big inconvenience but what if I want to pull this up exactly five feet from where it's at now I come up here it stops me at four foot four and a quarter so what I could do is stop it and now drag it up the remainder but I would have to know exactly what that remainder is that means I'd have to do math and you guys know I'm going to resist that at all costs what I could do instead is that modifier key remember the toggle create new starting face when you create a new face it kind of creates this new whole new set of geometry and it doesn't care about the inferencing or the limitations of that previous geometry so that means I could pull up here and I could type five foot enter and it will snap to exactly five foot now the downside of course is you have some extra geometry if I wanted to maintain this as one piece I would want to come in here and just real quick maybe delete these edges I do have to be conscious of the fact that if I turn x-ray Embassy I got one extra Edge dangling in there I want to get rid of that too again if I wanted to keep this but it is important to know that as you're modeling that modifier to that modifier to appointed the erase modifier the toggle create new starting phase will allow you to push past geometry where normal Push Pull will stop and limit you all right final thing to know is pushing through walls this this is probably of all the issues people run into this is probably the biggest one so I have two walls here this is a perfect rectangle pulled up the front and back are the same distance apart on either side if I grab this and I start push pulling I can come through and I can actually inference to the back you see that it's just snapping right in the back and I can release every once in a while you can't do that for whatever reason you're at a weird angle something like that it's hard to hard to snap to that face right there if that's the case what I would recommend is try a corner right here see right here here I have a very simple snap point and as long as this wall is perpendicular to the world axes then that's not a problem but what if it's not perpendicular we'll say I had this and I oops took this geometry now it's it's not perfectly it actually doesn't matter I can still snap back because I'm pushing perpendicular I can actually still snap back to these points so super easy way to do that now what happens when the world's not perfect it happens I know that I want to say we can live in a perfect world but we can't so here if I try to bring this back I get some weird stuff when I try to inference the back wall see that's just kind of like it's changing color and like just running through if I inference this right here it doesn't push through but inferences over here it turns blue and runs through to the other side there's an issue with this wall in that it's not perfectly Square this end is just slightly wider than this end so I don't have parallel this face and this face are not parallel so what do I do in that case well fortunately it's kind of it's not a terribly difficult fix if I just drag my geometry through like that triple click to select it all right click intersect face with selection then I can just grab this stuff delete it delete it I mean the ideal solution is to get your wall back in plane these the front and back should be parallel but if for whatever reason it's a remodel it's an old house it really looks like that whatever if you have to you can just run it through cut it off and you'll be good just like you had interacted or inter intersected with the back face so there we go those are five things to know about using Push Pull as I do this I'm thinking there's there's probably a couple other use cases I could come up with that would be good to talk about but man top five lists are cool aren't they don't just want to know the top five things six and seven they're probably good to know but I'll pick them up on my own top five
