hey everyone Eric here today I want to share with you a couple of tips that will hopefully make the process of adding crown molding to your model a little more [Music] fun now I don't know about you but who doesn't like crown molding or at least who doesn't like modeling crown molding so as you can see behind me we are going to add some to a little interior design model that I have but I want to point out that it's not all fun in games there are a couple things that we need to consider especially when the fact that the molding has to go through openings or doors or the fact that you are using a complex profile so let's go ahead and look at all of those different things right now so I've got my molding I'm actually already done see quick video we can just stop there but I don't know about you it's probably a good idea to start from the beginning together so we can see the whole process I'm just going to come over here and erase my molding so what I have instead is a four group and a Wall Group that's it I'm just starting the process of detailing out my interior model here and what I want to do is think about how I want to approach this now I already know that I can use the follow me tool um in order to make the molding but I want to think about what am I following do I want to come and grab the the Wall Group here and then go this way but then I stop and then I have to come over here and grab this wall group and then do it again so do I want to do it on the uh manually so I've cut a few options now I don't know if this is the best way but this is the way my brain says to do it it actually says don't go along the wall at all in fact go along the floor let's start by copying a piece of the floor off the side I'm going to do that because I want to kind of go back and forth between being able to see what the crown molding looks like in context but also being able to work with it a little bit independently so you can see just you know exactly what I'm doing every step of the way so here if I turn on my X mode and I kind of zoom in you can see that the floor group is actually does not follow the wall the floor group goes all the way to the outer edge of the wall but not the inner one so for me the first step that I want to do is sort of get a profile that I can tell my crown molding to follow so I'm going to pop in here and I'm going to say intersect faces with model now be careful because if you've got furnishings and a bunch of other stuff it may intersect with everything now I've got nice fresh model so I can do that with confidence but just again keep in mind where you are in the process it may or may not be something you may want to actually intersect with selection and select the walls instead but up to you depends on the model you're working on so you can see what happened there if I undo that because I was talking I'm going to do that again come over here select intersect faces with model and watch this is the reason why I pulled this to the side because you can't see it with the walls is now I've got this much more detailed profile it goes in and out out and around that's where my built-in cabinets and my kitchen counter and my bookshelf and all that stuff's going to go so now I actually have not the outer group anymore but I have the Inner Line that represents where I want my crown molding to go and you can see here that even if I wanted it to go around the columns all I have to do is just pull that column back just the width of the crown molding and now all of a sudden you can see what that inner group looks like not worried if it's going to go behind like my fridge and stuff I'm just going to go ahead and ignore that I know some of you probably are noticing that why go through the effort actually I'm not this is the easier way to do it I've got my profile ready now I need uh sorry I've got my path ready now I need my profile so if I zoom way in and I'm going to use the right arrow key so I can lock this along an axis I'm going to type in one comma four because that's kind of the size that I want to use so it's very small so I'll zoom in and then I select the path that I want so not just the path but actually the face that represents the path that I want and then come over here to follow me and then click follow me and then click this this profile once and you can see there it is I've got all of this done now I have to be careful though because right now I this is on the they're all on the same group together so what I might want to do first don't have to do this but you may want to come in and think about giving it a material first and the reason why is because then when you do that when you do that follow me step you can then rightclick it and say select all on the same material and then select and then you can come over here sorry not select make group so now my molding is independent is grouped independently from my face now I like to do that just helps me to know that everything is sort of safe and does not stick to each other so let's talk about those openings maybe it's best here to pop back into the model with the walls so that you can see exactly what I mean by openings there's a doorway there now that profile that I did here it's so simple all I got to do is just push and delete so in two clicks I can just get rid of that molding because I'm using a relatively simple profile we're going to do this in just a second with a harder one you can see what I felt like when I did this when I was testing some different methods I felt like doing the whole room in one click including the columns um and then pushing out the doorways that that was sort of the easier way to go was pretty quick actually it was slow because I was talking but was actually pretty fast if I was to do that over again now but what if you have a more complicated profile because it push pulled then maybe isn't the best solution so let's look at uh an alternative way to basically accomplish the same task so what I'm going to do is go back in we're going to delete we're going to go into my floor group since I grouped those separately I'm going to delete my molding and we're going to do this one more time so same thing I'm going to come over here I'm going to say one comma four and I'm going to also paint this a material I maybe paint it a little bit lighter just so I can see because it's going to be a little bit more complicated I want to make sure I can see all of the details that I'm going to draw so start with with my arc tool and I'm just making this up so if you're a woodworker or molding expert out there just you know forgive me I just for this demo I just wanted something that has kind of an interesting shape to it something that you know looks plausible and and I'm just going to stop it there so find that tangent so I don't need that bit there so same process applies I've applied a material to that so I'm going to select my same face group U my same floor face come over here grab the follow me and in one click there it is so then I'm going to come over here and same thing I did before select all them same material and make that a group okay so now I've got my group let's pop back over and see how it looks in context it looks good but as I said you cannot just push pull this anymore doesn't want to do that it's too complex it's got all this extra geometry well you probably thinking why don't you just use the Eraser tool all right let's try that I'm going to erase problem is I just lost my top face and again now I'm you know it's just erasing I'm going to end up losing information that I don't want to lose so I'm going to undo that a different way to think about this would be to turn this profile or turn this crown molding into a solid so right now it is a solid so a solid basically means there's no lines there's no edges it's complete it's got the it's got a bottom face there's no holes if you have a solid group like this then you can just bring in a solid group that you can then use to create like what I'm calling a cutting component so by a cutting component I mean something that you can use let me actually make this a different I'm going to group that come in here push this up and pull this back out maybe change the color that a little bit so basically what that means is is that you can if this is a solid which it is and this is a solid which it is then you can basically say I want to take this object here and I can open up my solid tools palette and I want to find this one here that says subtract I want to subtract this from this and then there you go it's gone so that's how easy it is now I'm going to do that one over again because if you noticed I actually have more than one opening that I need to cut so I actually can turn on my hidden geometry and I can come in here and I'm just going to unhide that because you can see I did that same step but I already placed one two 3 four and five so all of these are just loose geometry they're just little extruded rectangles and they are also a solid group so they're both solid so I'm going to do the same thing I want to take these and I want to subtract them from my crown molding so I have to make sure that these are in the same subgroup so subtract those from my crown molding and there you go it's punched out all of my holes all at once and it does not matter how complex the geometry is it'll just punch it because it's a solid now I've got my nice ornate detailed crown molding you can see how fast that was now I'm ready to move on to lay out my furniture and I'm good to go so I'm going to leave you there in fact actually I'm not going to leave you quite yet I want to plug behind me now you know me I like to plug stuff um if you like the model that we're working on and you want to see that step but a little bit slower and also with a lot more detail as far as what came before and then of course what's coming after you can check out our course on Commercial Interiors here on SketchUp campus that's learn. sketchup.com there'll be a link in the description and then you can go through not just that lesson on crown molding but you can go through a lot of these other lessons for doing the walls and doing the adding materials and of course setting up camera views and getting ready to export your scene when you're all done so I hope you learned something new I hope you enjoyed that hope you had as much fun working with molding as I did and I'm going to leave you with thank you and see you next time [Music]
