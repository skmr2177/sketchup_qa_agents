hey everyone Eric here and today I want to share with you some of my tips for taking sketchup's default style capabilities and pushing them to their limits so what do I mean like pushing style capabilities to the limits I think most of us that are familiar with SketchUp have already explored the Styles menu we know that we have control over edges whether that's thickness or even color and we know that we have control over some overrides whether that's monochromatic or color by tag as far as the face style but there's a few things that actually get interesting when you combine those things so that's what I want to do I want to do a little bit of exploration a little bit of tinkering and uh I think the results are going to be fun so stay with me let's do this speaking of style I kind of wanted to start with a stylized model and not get hung up too much on realism for this uh for this lesson or this demo so I've got my little fox here that I modeled kind of created a little forest scene that I'm in the process of building out this is just kind of a starting point where I was playing around and um you can see it's low poly and that's perfect because what we want to do stylistically is not focus so much on adding materials in this case um we just kind of want to focus on line and color and Shadow and light so with that said I'm going to go ahead and expand both my shadow and my Styles pallets and kind of push them off to the side here make them bigger if I need to and I want to start by kind of pointing out a something really quick so by default if you are familiar with how Shadows work you can adjust both the lightness and the Darkness and what happens is is that when you're looking at something like orange like this is a single color in my model it's orange but you can see that the orange displays differently depending on how much light or Shadow light or dark I want to play with so for this demo I actually want to push my darkness up toight 90 and I want to push my lightness down to zero and what that gives me is it gives me that true color so you can see that's actually the true color that I've got that I've applied so I'm actually not working with light in this case I want to work with just color and just Line work and we're going to come back to Shadows here at the end so don't I've got a surprise on that one so even with the Shadows turned on you can see my Shadows are on you see can they don't show up they don't show up because I've slid my lightness slider all the way down so they're on but they don't show up anyway so now let's kind of take a look at one of the first options that we have with Styles um that's I'm going to kind of I'm going to ignore Shadows for right now but we'll come back to this so under Styles um I have the default style that most of it it's mostly default and what I mean is is that um if you look over here if you start at the far left which is Edges most of the default style is set like this edges are showing profiles are showing and set set to a thickness of two and your color is all the same and it's set to as dark basically solid black as black as black goes so that's pretty much how whenever you open a new SketchUp model even if the background might be a little bit different color most of the time that's the setting that we all get so most people don't change that style which means that when they post their model or they share it theirs is going to look a lot like other people's because that's the default style so what I want to do is do a couple of things let's explore what happens when we start to customize starting with just the edges I'm going to go ahead and for this I'm going to turn edges off completely so what happens when I turn edges off I get just the profiles so a profile is kind of flank the outer line of the group so if I turn my edges on you can see that I've got some 2D trees here if I turn my hidden geometry on some of these are 2D face Mees and some of these are sort of 3D I'm playing around stylistically with the geometry um but so if I turn those hidden lines off and I turn edges off you can see that all those interior edges that make up the polygons are gone so even with hidden geometry on those don't show up I get just that sort of outer profile which is kind of cool stylistically um and I'll give you an example why two that helps as you can see the rings on this tree this was actually done if I switch to monochromatic mode you can see that those edges actually show um and I may want to just use that alternating material between light and dark of the wood grain create that wood grain so by turning those edges off and leaving my color on you can see that I get a nice kind of stylistic color there so that's one reason kind of why you might want to um just turn the edges off completely just depending on what it is the level of detail that you want to show now for me here though I want to look at a couple things number one is the profiles I can push this up if I'm going with a cartoonish style I can push the profiles up higher which might actually help me now if you get too much it starts starts to get a little blocky maybe it starts to get a little messy so I might kind of try three that looks okay little heavy you know the default two isn't too bad if I go to one two if you go to one if you've ever noticed this that's basically the same as if you didn't have the profiles on and you had your edges turned on so that's that profile uh set to one you'll notice when I turn profiles on and off it shows up on round objects but on these objects it's no thicker than it normally is because our default edges are set to a thickness of one so if you do like that sort of outer edge if I turn my edges off completely and I just want a nice thin profile I could leave that set to the lowest setting which is one same as my edges or you know if I'm okay with just something a little more cartoonish I could push this up personally the thicker the edges are the darker the more that that sort of black uh I don't want to say bugs me but it starts to read as like heavy so one cool trick here is that under Edge collar you can c click color here and that highlights and it means that the colors are active so this is black I want to kind of show you what happens when we go black little bit lighter and I'm just going to kind of Step through I'm going through my crayons here I know if you're on Windows or PC you don't have crayons but you can do this again with the color wheel if you just wanted to start with like slide it from black and then just kind of pull that edge style I'm going to go all the way until we get to White and see what that looks like maybe that's too thick so I'll set it back to one and that's an interesting look you can see the difference between white and black is that white lightens the model and black kind of darkens it or makes it more heavy so black white or gray light gray black now personally for me I like to kind of step it down just a little bit two or three Shades so it's somewhere in that kind of charcoal gray color what's nice about that is you get the definition of having those darker edges but you don't get the um you don't get the really heaviness that you would see with black while we're on edges I'm going to stop with the color here because instead of changing it to a single color that's what happens when the color of the edges is set to all the same if I change it to BU material what it's going to do it's going to pick up the underlying material that's underneath it I'm going to bump this up just a little bit to something like two or even three for this so you can see this just a little bit better you can see that those edges are there if you look closely those edges are there but it's pulling the color from the color of the object so if I change the color of the object I can change uh the color of that edge so The Bu material is kind of nice because you can see that there's just a little bit of definition but it's really subtle and I kind of like that now one way to do that though is you kind of want to think about you may need to think about how this is grouped like for example if I have this whole Fox group here and I apply a color to it and I'm just bear with me here um nothing's going to happen because I've got subgroups so if you depending on where you want to apply Color you can either pick up the color from the face or you can pick up a color from the group that's a little bit confusing I confuse myself when I say that you can actually have two different colors on a single object but what I mean is and let's maybe use the rock that's a better example because it's not made up of multiple pieces but I've got this rock here and if I select this you can see that I've got a color applied to the outside of the face but I've also got a color applied to the face as well so both the face has a color and the object has a color so if I change in under in my entity in info box if I change the color like something like again I'll try that pink see if that works you can see that I have now a different color from the color of the Rock and that's because I'm using it by material so if I set it to all the same it's going to be all the same if I set it to by material then it's going to ask me well which material if there's no material applied to the outside like if I set this back to say the default color then it's going to grab it's going to just use the default color which is the same which is this color which is the color of my um default Line work so by applying a color to the outside if you wanted to say go lighter you could go lighter and you can have a just this object have a different color Edge than the other objects in your model in this case going lighter might be kind of weird going pink might be kind of weird maybe going let's try this again maybe going just one shade darker if you see if you look really close it's like one shade or maybe even two Shades Darker than the actual color the face color of the Rock and again this depends on your lighting because if you have your lighting uh then the face color is going going to um either show or not show so right now it's why I turned the light off because I wanted to deal with just the Pure Color and not deal with um with sort of how the color appears with the way the light is hitting it so I'm going to wrap up here by doing one more thing I want to close out by kind of doing a an interesting trick which is colored Shadows now I know that's something that some people have been asking for for a while I know that's something that maybe um is in the works but for now there is kind of a little bit of a workaround you can see that my shs are still there but they're not showing but if I change the color on the Styles menu if I come over here to the background color I can set a background color that is different right now it's set to White which is why you're not seeing anything but I can set a background color like let's say blue and then make sure that the Shadows are showing which means on ground so right there I kind of had them off by default which maybe I shouldn't have but I should be on by default which is on ground so when I turn my Shadows back on what's happening is that my Shadows you can see if I zoom out my background color is sort of blue almost like water but my I have this plane this is my ground plane and it sits it's sort of sits above the background or just underneath it maybe just slightly underneath it so when I zoom in I have essentially even though my lightness sliders turned all the way down I have this ability now to show colored shadows and what's cool about that is that I can just kind of play around with the Hue so the lighter the color is the more it might feel like it's picking it's letting that brown the sort of light brown of my ground plane come through um and then of course the darker it is the more it's going to feel like it's standing out from the background so finding that sort of right balance as if it's almost like a natural color that you might see um if you were out in the landscape is kind of cool now there's no Shadows actually on the tree or the objects itself these are just Shadows that are on the ground and that's why I say it's a bit of a trick and it may or may not work for what you're trying to do and of course if you zoom out your background is going to be colored which is why I have this ground plane so if I zoom in I get sort of an interesting stylistic um choice so those are my style choices and I think there's actually quite a bit more you can do I'm not going to go into it but if you wanted to play around with face style for example uh um and you wanted to play around with now face style and background color like if I turn that background color to white you have just really really a lot of control with how objects are expressed and of course I didn't even really go into color by tag mode when we go into color by tag mode uh there's quite a bit let's see color by tag is on there we go so really cool stylistic things that we can do uh just depending on what you're um what you're after what you're going what you're going for each of these settings I think give you a lot of control on their own so changing the color of the edges changing the uh lightness of the faces the color of the faces based on the shadow settings each of those can be done individually to give you your own personal style but what's really cool that I'm trying to show here is that when you start combining methods now all of a sudden I'm playing with background Ed color Edge thickness lightness I'm combining these things and I'm getting something not only unique to me but I think unique to a lot of people who use SketchUp who haven't seen SketchUp sort of expressed visually this way so I'm going to stop there I'm going to encourage you to take over and start playing around and let me know how some of these tips or how some of these Styles can be used in your work so as always post it in the comments below
