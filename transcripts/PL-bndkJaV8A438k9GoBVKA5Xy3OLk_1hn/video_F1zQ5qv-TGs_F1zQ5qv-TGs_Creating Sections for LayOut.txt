hey y'all my name is Tyson and this time around let's create some sections in SketchUp in preparation for taking them to layout yeah so this will be part one of two videos and here we're gonna just stay in SketchUp and create some section cuts and share some tips and tricks but this will be kind of a high level overview of creating sections for layout and then in part two uh the next video we'll build out some pages and layout with these sections again this is a high level overview of sections but with that said let's have a look this model is um The Whistler Library Whistler Canada it was designed by The Firm hcma and let's Jump Right In I've created this model I've built it with a number of tags they may not necessarily be the ideal tags for what we're doing but that should work out now when I add a section plane I can tap the right arrow key left Arrow key up Arrow key you can align sections and lock them to the axes so I'm going to tap the right arrow key and cut a section let's say right through these stairs and this will be let's say our East Elevation I don't actually know if this is East but we're going to pretend that it is when you create a section like this you have a couple options Under The View menu you have section planes section cuts which is the poche section sorry section cut is turning the cut on and off in section fill now I've added these options up here on my toolbar for Simplicity so here you can see that is the section fill the section cut will actually be cutting through the model and the section plane is turning this on and off now because this is along the axis I could let's say jump through some of my views find the right one go up to camera term perspective off and I've got my orthographic elevation however that said I'm going to turn my section plane back on if this was not on the axis you can right click on a section plane and say align View and that's really handy like I say especially if you have suction cuts that are not on an elevation or if you just want have a sec several suction cuts and just one automatically jump to one so with this setup I'm pretty close to what we want maybe I don't I may add people let's say in layout but the one thing I'll do here is uh let's turn some of the Entourage elements off and then let's change the style just so that we'll create kind of a few different styles this one will just be a simple black and white Style um I think I will simply turn the axis off the one other thing that we may want to do here I think I will leave this as it is but we might want to turn Shadows on and then adjust them here now you do have some control in layout but it will probably be to our advantage to do that here if we wanted them I say I'm actually going to not uh not bother with shadows but go ahead and do that and then we'll go to scenes and save this now in layout one of the things that we'll do is we'll clean up some of this other the other pieces here so that this looks a little better it's really helpful to have tags that you can turn on and off and can those carry over the layout but some of this stuff will clean up in layout directly so that's a simple introduction to creating a section plane let's create another creative floor plan I'm going to turn my previous style back on and turn that section cut off now this section Let's uh say we want to put it right around here and I'm going to tap the up Arrow key and so we'll go to a top down view when I look at this I think what I want to do on this one is turn off some of this other some of the surrounding area here so let's turn off all the Entourage which will turn off the ground let's turn off let's say the sidewalk and the garage level I'm going to generally fill my view here now a couple things that you can do I I actually like this style um I will turn off the action display this looks fine I'm actually going to save this as a scene right now but you could some of the options you have let's say in the styles is to come in and say well if your section fill I think I just got a dark gray as a section field but you can change this to anything you would like and another thing to note uh particularly in this View I'm going to dig into my model now the way I built this um originally probably wasn't set up very well for breaking it down because I think the floor and the walls I was I was just going off of a um some of the drawings I could find but when I look at the floor now I sort of broke it out separately if I hide the rest of the model you can see that this is just a really basic floor but I have broken it around broken it surface so that I can have some different materials and that's just aligned with the walls but it could be really helpful to build your model out you know as different um walls floors elements again different things you may want to turn on and off the other thing to point out here is that these doors I did put them on their own tag but we did a skill Builder just within the past few weeks about how you could take something like a door and combine several components inside it so I could have a closed door an Open Door a door swing symbol or various elements put those on different tags and then import that entire component and then I'd be able to close all the doors at once open them at once so if that sounds like something interesting and you haven't seen that scale Builder go check out the skill Builder just uh within the last few weeks all right so we've got our floor plan our elevation let's do one more so I'm going to turn perspective back on and toggle these off let's say in this one it's um we kind of want an illustrated look where we cut a section plane just through the roof so that we can look inside the building and highlight something well a section plane will cut through whatever context you put it in as we've seen so far the section planes we've just put them on basically in the model as a whole so anything we put just cuts through the entire model but if we wanted to we could go into a group or component and cut just through that however and if I examine this it looks like my roof I've got my roof I've got the the beams that's supported I've got a different piece for a roof so I'm going to combine all of those into one group so select the ceiling the beams this roof and I'm going to group those together and let me put those back on the roof layer roof tag old habits now if I wanted to put this section cut aligned with let's say this part of the building that's not actually aligned with the axis and there's a couple ways that we might try this one is we could simply put a a section maybe aligned with here and then I take this section I can move it in and right click on it and reverse let me do it up here and reverse so remember that you can reverse a section cut and it might be easier in our case to do that I'm gonna just to show one other way we could do this I'm going to turn off the roof assembly and let's say I put a section cut using the inside and it's facing the right way and I pull it back a little bit I'm going to cut this out of the model so I could go edit cut or use a cup board shortcut I'm going to turn the roof assembly back on and then I'm going to enter that roof assembly and paste it in place you can copy and paste section cuts uh just like anything else so by pasting it goes exactly where I wanted it earlier and it's cutting just the context of the roof group that I've entered so like before let's turn the section planes off choose a view I don't know if Shadows at this point might be useful or not actually let's turn our Entourage back on this looks fairly dark uh so let's lighten these Shadows up something like that and let's say you know this is just a we'll use this as an illustration purpose being able to cut just through the roof so view something like this and I'm going to save that as a scene now let's double check make sure these are all working correctly so we've got our floor plan our East Elevation all right perfect that we can take the layout and build some pages from great we're set up like I say in the next video we will take these same examples take them over to layout and build some pages out um let us know if you have questions on anything we covered here like say there's actually more we could do with sections and certainly uh some Advanced tips if you were going to do um in-depth construction documentation but this is a good introduction if you have any other questions in general or any suggestions for other things that we can do in these videos please let us know in the comments as always give us a like a subscribe and thanks all for joining us we'll see in the next one foreign
