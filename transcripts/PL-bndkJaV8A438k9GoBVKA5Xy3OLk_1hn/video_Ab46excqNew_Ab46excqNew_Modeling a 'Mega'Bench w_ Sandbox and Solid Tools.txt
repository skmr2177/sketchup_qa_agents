hey everyone this is Eric and today because it's summer and I like to go out and sit and people watch we are going to model a park bench together but not just any bench actually the biggest bench I've ever seen it's actually called Mega bench so what you can see behind me we're going to do that stay with me so what exactly is a mega bench other than just a really big bench this is actually a specific bench let me pull up an image I was traveling recently in Vancouver BC and if you take the ferry across from downtown into North Vancouver there's a new Plaza that is built in the shipyards uh of the lawdale neighborhood or District now this bench here comprises of over 1,000 wood slats that undulate it's 50 m long by 3 m wide so by Mega bench I think it earns its title so now here's the thing though that's the bench how are we going to model this in SketchUp and how am I going to do it in just 10 to 15 minutes that is a mega problem for me to solve and for you to see if I can do it so let's get let's just go ahead and get to it so um actually before I do that let me just kind of talk to you a little bit about the complexity of how we're going to do this so number one you can see that the bench goes up and down and up and down it has a grade change so you can see it's higher in the back and then lower in the front and and it has a batter to it so that's like a slight uh tilt or lean so that when you lean against it it's comfortable so we go flat to battered to up to down to up to down to up and then finally down again so let me show you what I mean here if I click on my section cut you can see here if you watch the profile growing watch as the profile of the bench changes as it reveals itself here it's now it's down then it's going back up again and then all of a sudden it kind of levels off and it becomes these two platforms with the the batter so a lot going on of course I don't have a thousand slots here I have a little bit less than that but let's um let's see the hardest part about this thing actually is not the modeling it it's just thinking about how the brain interprets the ups and downs and the lefts and rights and the tilts so let's go ahead and start with a brand new file so there I am hi Eric let's draw out let's go to units so we're going to go model info units and I'm going to go decimal because it is in Vancouver and we're going to change this to meters and again I might have to flip back and forth because I work in Imperial normally so we're going to type in 50 m long comma 3 m wide so this is sort of how big this bench is because I know that this comes up 18 in which is sort of the seat Wall height and I know that there's a grade change of another 18 in and that's kind of why you get this back to the bench so if I go up another 18 in you can see here there's stairs at the edge where you'd go from the upper Plaza to the lower Plaza not really important for our purposes but you can see that it actually works as a dual-sided bench so you got 18 inches on the top side 18 inches on the bottom side so with that what we need to do is think about that batter now I'm going to go ahead and just put this batter in now by batter what I mean is that kind of tilt so if I push this back I'm going to lean this back Edge Let's push this back I don't know what the right amount is I'm kind of guessing so I'm going to say 6 in because I feel like that looks right and I feel like that looks comfortable if you were to kind of lean against that now the second thing we need to do is figure out how many divisions we need in order to be able to do the ups and downs and where the flats are I'm going to grab this whole end and I'm just going to copy it and I'm just going to times this by seven again I've already kind of done the hard thinking I know there's seven pieces 1 2 3 4 5 6 seven and then I know that this one stays flat this far right one stays flat bottom flat top which means the undulations start if I go back to this image just really quick you can see that the undulation starts here and it goes up to a high point and then it drops back down three waves one two three if you look really close these back waves these other two actually go up higher than the back of the bench whereas this first wave looks like it sits flush so I'm going to go ahead and sit that first wave flush and then I'm going to pull these second waves um two and three up higher so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to take my arc tool and I'm going to start my wave here so I want to come up to about there and then I know that this one here comes down down so that's kind of my this will be my first wave and I'm not like making sure that this is any particular radius I'm just kind of drawing it now here's where the next waves are going to get taller so what I'm going to do is come up and I'm going to inference and I'm going to come up an extra foot I'm going to come up an extra um not that high maybe 2.5 ft and what that does 2.5t there we go so now this extra line here is a foot it comes up 11 in and that's okay um I'm just guessing again it just means that there's going to be a little bit of a slope as you come up and that's the peak of the wave so I'm going to grab that one here now that's this one goes up and then it goes down and then it goes up and then down again so let's stop there let's grab this here going to do the same Arc tool for this wave I'm just kind of eyeballing it at this point just to kind of move quickly you can see I did that wrong I was trying to go up to this peak there and then I want to go up to this peak again there and I'm just kind of making sure that these um I don't need all of this extra stuff you're going to see here in a second that I'm really just using this these little wav lines almost like a scaffolding so right if you think about this as the framework for running sandbox from Contours that's what we're going to do in just a second I've already got my sandbox tools up and running let's just get rid of all of this extra line work that I don't need that's just so that I knew where things touched this one's a little bit trickier here because this one um goes up but it stays flat so this one is where okay that one's fine I need that one but I have to kind of think about this because this back part needs to stay flat so I want to do is get rid of those all those extra lines but um maybe I'll keep that for right now we can always delete them afterwards so what I'm trying to do here is get just the scaffolding that I need I'm using the word scaffolding maybe that's not the right term but I'm I'm wanting to use the sandbox tools so I'm going to come over here and I'm going to grab this and that and this and that and that not the bottom only the edges and if I have to get a little flat part in there I can and you can see what I'm doing so I'm skinning I'm about to skin this whole thing there we go so uh this stays flat so this is all skinned so I'm going to go ahead and press sandbox from Contours and it should if I pull this up if I copy this up for a second you can see that that has made a nice little terrain skin so that's cool so what I'm going to do is just for fun I'm going to make a copy of this because I want to see where we're going where we've gone where we've been so let's make a copy of that this is where it's going to start to get a little bit interesting I now have the shape that I need if I turn off my hidden geometry I need to make sure that this is a solid group so I'm going to explode everything I'm going to use my x-ray mode and I'm get rid of any interior lines that happen to be in there because as you know if you know anything about solid groups in SketchUp you can't have this interior geometry um or else it won't be solid so in this case I might even have to go in and group and then delete this and then here we go so if I turn off my x-ray mode now we need to make this a group so not just a group but a solid group you can tell if it's solid by opening up your entity info and seeing solid group if it doesn't say that it could be that there's a stray line for example there's a stray line no longer a solid group if I go back in delete that stray line and you can see if I select it solid group we are good so now if I want to get complicated I can go in and create more fancy shapes but I actually don't need this this is not the bench this is going to be the thing that we cut to make the mold to then cut the bench from the slats so this is where the again the the modeling is not difficult it's the pre-thinking that is hard so let's go ahead and grab the thing that we are going to skin so here I'm just going to make a simple rectangle I'm going to pull this all the way to the end I'm going to group that and just to differentiate it let's go ahead and give that maybe um a transparent color so we can see so what I need to do is I need to remove essentially I'm going to remove this from this and that's where solid tools comes in handy both both of them are solid groups I'll leave this open so I can see solid group solid group now I can use solid tools that's the second tool set that I pulled out here I've got my sandbox of course now what I want to do is I want to remove this from this so I believe if I click this one first and then hover over this icon it says subtract and then I can choose my red box and then you can see what happened is I've sort of inverted my bench right so I now have everything except for the part that I need for for my bench and that's because I'm going to use this to cut from my slats so let's go ahead and model some slats now I'm going to grab this here just so that I kind of know how big I just want to kind of remember the dimensions that I'm working with so I just need to know that this is this is the start I don't I don't need these lines here I just want to know where the start and where the end is of my 50 m so I'm going to draw something like around here and then I'm going to give that a thickness so I'm going to pull that out now the slats in real life are probably closer to 2 in but I don't really want a thousand Slants in my model I kind of want half of that so I'm going to make this um a 4in thick wood slat and then I'm going to copy that instead of copying that a thousand times I'm going to go ahead and copy that uh let's see here hang on let me make sure that okay yep so let me do that again let me copy that over and snap it at the edge of place we're going to use the um modifier so I'm using the modifier copy uh move and then instead of hitting the number of copies I want because I don't know how many I want I'm just going to hit divide by and I've already tried this and I think somewhere around 400 copies works so I'm going to do that and the reason why I'm using 400 is because I'm wanting a gap in between them but I want the Gap to be much smaller than the actual slat the wood piece itself so now I can just just basically select all of those wood slats subtract hold shift to subtract my cutter and make those a group and if I did this right you're going to see that this is a solid group so I didn't actually make these components this is all loose geometry so each slat is actually just loose geometry and that was done for a reason because as a group now I have them as one solid group and I need that so that I can then do the same thing that I just did I'm going to select this one first instead of this one and then that one I'm going to select the cutter so I'm going to want this is my cutter and I'm going to say cut from here which is the um slats now because there's 400 of them it is going to take I don't know anywhere between 30 seconds and a minute for me on my machine to process if you're doing a really really complex operation like I am where you're cutting lots and lots and lots of geometry using solid tools I would suggest being patient and just taking your hand off the mouse for a second and just letting it do its thing and there it is you can see it's done cutting I'm going to go ahead and um it used the the um sort of transparent color that I used from my cutting object so I'm just going to go inside this whole thing and let me just go ahead and remove any of the materials um so I can start fresh with a nice wood color what color do I want to do I don't know doesn't really matter but let's just kind of Pop something in there and then let's take a closer look at the final result so if I turn my hidden geometry on or if I turn my back edges maybe just my hidden geometry on you can see those undulations you can see we go up we start down we go up and then we go down and then we go up and then down and then up and then we level out and again if you get any extra straight lines like I have here that's all right you can just hide them it's not a big deal it all just depends on where everything kind of lined up and I'm kind of okay with having to hide a couple of straight edges um but you know really really cool the fact that it didn't actually take me that long to do the actual modeling what took me a long time was to figure out what was up what was down where does it step back where does it batter where does it start where does it finish that's what sort of took me um the most amount of time the actual modeling you can see using only two native tools which is sandbox tools and the solid tools so two native tools and I was able to create this you know fairly complex bench in a short amount of time so hope that that was interesting and that you um hope that was not just cool but Mega cool so I'm going to leave you there I hope that you learned something new I hope that uh my point here in doing this bench was to reinforce again one more time is that the hard part is the thinking the easy part is the modeling if you know which tools to deploy whether they're native tools or if you felt like maybe in the future you want to say how would an extension handle something like this of course there's always that option and you can go that way too so I'm going to say thanks for watching as always if you haven't already subscribe so that you get all the notifications when we release these videos especially the live streams that come every Friday and I will say thanks for watching and I'll see you
