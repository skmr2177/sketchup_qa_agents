hey y'all Tyson here and we're gonna go into part two of our introduction to snaps yes so hopefully you've seen our previous video on this new feature in SketchUp snaps and in this video we're just gonna dig in and kind of go into you know more methods of how you can create them and manipulate snaps and just some ideas around how you might use them let's jump in so let's start with um just creating some snaps from scratch and methodologies you might use so if I look uh we had these shelves before this one you know has a few snaps set up but this one doesn't yet let's set those up now let's do that in two ways maybe I want to create some guides first the nice thing about snaps is it lets me create a a point here where one doesn't exist based on the geometry and so I want that point in the center of this shelf and I wanted I'll lock this at the floor so that's where I want this point right there I'm just going to edit this one level deep and say right click make edit snaps now one of the things you can do with snaps is use the arrow keys to lock a direction just like other tools so if I hit the right arrow key it's red left for green up blue in our case it looks like I need the green so I'm going to hover over that where those guys cross and double click done easy peasy I've got my Snapper I want it's oriented correctly that's that's great let's do that a different way so I'm going to delete that snap into the and I'm actually going to delete my guides too what if we said well let's just create the snap so I'm going to come in here make edit snaps and I'm just going to put it right here I know it needs to face forward so I'm going to double click on this Shelf and place the snap then when I hit the selection key I can select that snap and it kind of acts like geometry so I'm moving it down locking the blue Direction so now I'm locking it to the floor I'll move it over lock it to this midpoint and then I will move this back and lock to this back corner of the Shelf and so I've still got that snap exactly where I need it and you know again you can create it in place or you can create it to the side and then move it into place either way it's pretty easy to create snaps let's create some more this time I will draw a line let's say from this box out I don't worry about exactly how far but again the idea of this is that I have several versions of these shelves and I want to easily be able to snap them side by side so let's right click make some snaps this looks like it's in the correct orientation already but again I can tap the arrow keys to change that but yep red I believe double click on that line and uh we don't need that line anymore so we've got one snap there I want one on each side one thing you can do again I'll just select the snap and then toggle the flip command and I'm going to make a copy so tapping the modifier key to make it copy and then again I'll find the center point here of my shelf and we look at that it did indeed so we've got a copy on each side perfect one of the things that you should get in the habit of doing when you're making um snaps is testing them so if I take my shelf I say let me see how that lines up I will move it from this snap make a copy and snap it right here now that might look okay except actually what I did is I made a mistake I because I based those on this box I really needed to base them on the outside of the legs no problem I'm going to come in here and just grab this snap use the move tool lock the red Direction and lock it to the leg same thing over here I'll start moving that out lock the red Direction move it to the outside of the leg just a simple mistake a quick test again and that is exactly what I want so that's pretty easy and the great thing about snaps as you've seen we're sort of just moved them like regular geometry and now I want to have snaps in this shell so I'm gonna edit this component shelf component select one two even drag select I've got the three snaps I just created I'm going to copy them on my keyboard close that and hit my shortcut key or go to edit paste in place let me be sure I selected these so I'm going to copy paste in place I made a mistake there I was trying to paste snaps into open space and that's not how Snaps are created snaps only are embedded in groups and components so it wasn't pasting them simple mistake easy to correct because I pasted them into this Shelf and now I'm going to select move them say by that mid one and line them up to a midpoint here so it's easy to copy and paste snaps where you need them and now if I move this Yep looks like they are working correctly awesome so that's a little bit about creating snaps one of the things to keep in mind with snaps we've talked about before that snaps have a front and back face and in this case the front face is oriented outward and you can see the back face here this is corresponding to the style so a typical front and back face even though my style is a little bit different than the default one if I go into Styles and edit this style I can say you know what let's make that back color up bright red and we'll make that front color a nice light blue now you can see that that front and back they take on the front and back colors and if I move that indeed you can see those changes there so if you want more visual um Separation on your snaps you can change the front and back color I'm gonna revert back but that is an option now let's look at something that is very uh enjoyably named the tractor beam when I take say one of these pipes and I move it from a snap and it's going to snap as as we'd expect but I can tap the command key I'm on a Mac or the ALT key on PC and you see how it creates this blue line and gives us a basically an indication of not only where it could snap to but how it would Orient to that so it is just going to pick the nearest Snap and give us a preview of what that could look like and I don't even have to actually hit the snap point I can from even from out here click and it'll snap to where okay if I hit command but invoke tractor beam it'll do that so that's tractor beam it'll give you a preview of what Snaps are going to do and one of the ways that that could be useful to you let's make a copy of this uh piece out here change it and let's say that I am going to copy a few of these now if I use the move tool one of the options is to cycle through copy and Stamp so if I do that before I've selected it copy stamp so I'm going to stamp this and from here is going to keep repeating but if I tackle the um Factor Beam on that could be a good visual way to see what I'm going to get as I move through this so whether or not you use it with stamp tractor beam can be really useful for visualizing how Snaps are going to interact that's a you know kind of an overview of some of the other features of snaps let's dive I've got my um I've got my scene here called into the weeds and that's where we're headed next this is kind of just some theoretical ways that you may or may not use snaps they may or may not be useful but I've created if I look at this it's a simple component and I've got a snap right in the middle one of the things that we talked about is that you should try to avoid embedding snaps deeply into nested groups and components it doesn't tend to work that well but that said let's say and this is not a great example but we're going to use it anyway let's say I'm going to take this and I'm going to copy this geometry a couple places I think I actually want to flip these but then I will Orient these a little differently however whatever we like and now I'm going to take this picture frame copy it I'm going to edit and I only have just the the three um the three snaps I created but I'm going to paste that picture frame in here it has a snap that's just oriented to the front so I'm going to move that by that snap and then any of these that I choose you can see it's automatically rotating to a line that two those exterior snaps that I created now again that's not the best example um but it's just one way where you could do something like this embed your snaps into um just other geometry that you can then turn off and it can help you just to play snaps or place objects in your groups and components another thing that might be useful maybe maybe not if I turn that back on if you're trying to put snaps in a tricky orientation or on a corner or something and you're having trouble getting it to work remember we can copy paste snaps so I could move this geometry into place then if I'm more comfortable using the geometry to rotate then I can come in copy that snap from here go into my geometry paste it in place here so now I've got that snap in that orientation that I wanted again is that going to be useful most of the time you're putting snaps in a pretty obvious place on flat surfaces it may not be but it is something to keep in mind now as far as this idea of um visual representation of what a snap is doing let's jump back to these pipes now I've put some of these sort of L arrows and those are just simple components black components that I have set in here and I have made these to orient the way that the snap is working so they're sort of for me just a visual guide and the reason I did that is because when I'm laying out let's say this pipe I may want this pipe to um you know come out this way and then I need this to turn right or to turn left well I can do either with this particular elbow based on which side I choose so if I need to turn left I can choose that one and if I need it to turn I'm sorry that's turning right and I need it to turn left then I can choose the other side but in this case what if I needed to turn up or down well it might seem oh well I'll just make a copy of this and rotate it now I'll move this here but that's not that's not how it's going to work and the guides help me realize that because they they helped me realize that even though I've rotated this if I place it here and then I'm going to extend this out you can see it is acting correctly it's sort of rotating it back into place the way it's the way it's set up so I made a unique component of this pipe and changed the snap Direction this time it's going this way and this one's going up and in that way I can take and say this one I do want to go up or down you see by selecting this side I'm going to go down and if I choose this other snap I can instead turn up so that is nothing more than to say um you know you can this only works because I'm changing the the snap Direction on this one but I'm leaving them the same here but if I change the direction here that changes the behavior here they're going to align and sometimes I can get confusing if you're trying to do a complex assembly so whether or not that's helpful you may want to create some guides that are totally separate but that just can give you sort of some visual representation of how you might um Orient different pieces so that they snap in the way that you want and then just go to town and have fun I I hope that wasn't too much in the weeds for you and it and it is it's a little bit I don't know theoretical because not sure how you plan to use snaps um you may use them very simply or you may create you know very complex assemblies and um whether guides or not will be useful to you whether the tractor beam will be useful to you it's at least cool that you can now invoke a tractor beam in SketchUp it's going to be fun to see where this evolves um I'm very excited for snaps as they are now I'm excited to see what y'all will create with them I know our community always just blows us out of the water with you know your ideas and how you push the envelope beyond what we even imagined was possible so I'm very excited for what's to come let us know what you think again let us know if you have questions on it is as it is now and let us know if you have feedback on how you want to improve this new feature of SketchUp that's all for now thank you again remember to hit that like And subscribe if you're not already and we will see you next time
