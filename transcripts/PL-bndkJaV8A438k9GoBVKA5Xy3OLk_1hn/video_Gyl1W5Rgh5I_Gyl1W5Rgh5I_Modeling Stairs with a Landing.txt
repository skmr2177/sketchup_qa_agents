hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at modeling a Stairway with a landing a landing and a turn we're going to go up hit a landing turn 90° finish going up that sort of thing now just fair warning our my plan is to get that model in there get proper Treads risers that kind of thing um We're Not Gon to do framing we're not going to go in and and put stringers in or anything like that but to get that initial geometry in uh is enough for this video so uh you know if if you decide that framing is really important let me know in the comments and we can we can do some along those lines too but now let's go make some stairs all right so I have this situation um not a lot of information here like uh I don't know exactly what any of these dimensions are but I'm in this scenario I want a little bit of lead off of this door maybe a foot and a half something like that at least uh have the stairs go up have you know I'll do a 3ot wide staircase so we'll have a 36x 36 Landing it's going to continue the rest of the way up until it hits this height up here so again I'm coming in without a lot of control over where I got to put this um but let's let's let's take a look at that so let's start with the landing so if I know that it's going to turn here and I want three foot wide stairs I'm going to make just on the ground I'm just going to draw up a 36 by by 36 square so that rep rep rep repents represents where my Landing is going to be all right now coming up to this Landing we are going to have some steps like I said I want at least a foot and a half of space there might be code for this I I don't know off the top of my head I apologize if I'm any any big uh code fans out there are appalled at the fact that I don't know this but there's might be some code for how far off of an opening I can have stairs I don't know what it is but I'm going to say I'm going to put a foot and a half so I'm 1 point5 ft all right and then I'm going to bring a line out 36 because that's how wide my step is I don't really need this Edge anymore all right so now I'm going to take that and I'm going to offset that uh by my tread width so I'm going to say I want uh 11 in steps so I'm going to push this off this way 11 in enter and I'm going say do that 3x 4X okay so if I have 11 in steps that means I can put one two 3 four steps before my 3ot of landing and still maintain my minimum of uh a foot and a half here so that means I can take one two oh the other thing I did I did lock this geometry so means I can do things like come in here and do a group select like that scoot this over and I got no problems um all right that looks pretty good I'm going to go ahead and do the same thing here I'm going draw a line right here take that option copy that over 11 in and I'm just going to say something like 15x I don't this take 15 Steps to get up but uh wow I did not plan that look how close I got to the edge of the room I don't to take 15 Steps to get up to this this uh floor height up here but there we go that's there all right so now we need to do is figure out our rise so I'm going to say I'm going to come over here I'm just going to do some scribble on the wall a little bit here I'm going to say I want to hey uh I don't know exactly what my Height's going to be I want to make sure that my height is less than the maximum pretty much as close as I can get to the maximum Riser height so less than 7 and3 quarters so I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a line all the way up like this I'm going to select that line and I'm going to divide and I'm just going to start sliding my cursor and as I slide it you can see when I stop stop moving my slide my my cursor it's going to tell me how many segments and then how big those are so I want to get those under seven and 3/4 there we go so if I put 16 steps that that's 7 and 1/2 in I'm going to click right there so I know this is basically my step I don't need all these delete those this is my step so what I'm going to do is I'm going to temporarily I'm going to make that a component I'm going to call this a stair it's going to have more in there but uh right now we're going to call it a stair I'm going to take that now I'm going to move it option copy here to here and I need three of those 3x is to get me to there now I can take this which is my Landing my height is 7 and a half so I'm pull that up 7.5 enter I'm going to do this now because I'm afraid I'm going to forget make that into a group all right and now let's let's just take these four steps we've already got going to option copy that and modify key move the same as copy I'm going to rotate that rotate it 90° and then we can take that option copy that up here two times there we go we got one extra delete all right so there's our steps and our Landing I don't know this doesn't look like much yet but it's going to come together as actual stairs pretty quickly all right I can delete my placeholder my my little tick marks there let's go into one of these these and let's draw up what our uh let's start with our Riser I'm going to take my Edge right here and I'm going to pull it up uh I want to say 1 inch piece of material so I'm going to I'm bring that up 6.5 in and then we want a little bit of a nose on there so I'm going to pull this out this way um I like 3/4 of an inch I know I apologize again Code Heads I'm sorry if I'm getting this wrong um and then I'm going to take this Edge bring this back one inch and then triple click make that into a group and then separate from that I'm going to come back that same 3/4 drop this down like that and there's our Riser get rid of that grab that that make that into a new group I can make these into components too I'm just I'm using groups for reasons unknown all right so now I can take this I go into this one say this is going to be 36 in watch how quick this happens because we have all of our components set up uh come into this one same thing double click all right there we go now each of our steps has a legal rise and tread um I have to come on here grab this Edge drop that down an inch and then bring it out 3/4 of an inch to match the uh the rest of my steps that looks pretty good um yeah I mean the last thing I would want to do is maybe take this one and offset this but I don't want to do that I'm going to have to make this grab this make that unique because in this one this group he's going to have to go an extra 2 feet to make a legal Landing there at the top so with that I've made steps let's go just uh you know just a a teeny bit further with this we got a couple minutes uh we can still play with let's put up like a a railing wall so a solid wall that's going to fill all this in um I'm going to come down here I'm going to come out like one inch and if I come up like actually let's go a little bit further I want to get past this uh this little the edge of the step so I'm going to go two inches out um I'm going to come up this high and then add another 30 in I honestly I don't remember uh what that height has to be for uh code either I know I'm I'm I remember rise and run but that's that's that's about it so what I'm going to do I'm going to copy that this is the where my wall is going to start and then I want it to match the slope of the of the stairs so I'm going to go like this and then I can just kind of continue that I'm just going to run that long all the way up along that magenta line till it hits the wall like that and then what I'll do is I'll bring this back to this corner right here and then go up there we go get rid of those pieces get rid of that get rid of that um and then I'll take this put this right here and rotate that inre oh it's coming together all right now I can take this piece give it some width I'll like a 4 in wall something like that um that continue this on up again I I'm a big fan of just run geometry long right uh really like having to mess with uh there we go knowing exactly where every piece has to go sometimes the geometry has to tell you how far it needs to run bring it back to here this interior edges this this there we go let me pull that out 4 Ines little bit of clean up to do right here this is simple enough and drop a line down draw a line over erase erase anything else to clean up back here yes I do oh my I need a whole face back here how about that for a clean up all right reverse that face looks good and then last thing uh I'm making up some architecture here I don't even know what's I I don't know what's going on uh we come 4 Ines here 4 in here delete delete all right and with that we probably make that into a group uh actually you know what this probably needs to go up further that's doing 30 in no that's that's higher than I thought it was perfect we're good all right so with that we have a stair that goes up turns on landing and then continues on up to the second floor quick and fairly painless and I didn't have to do a whole lot of math there I mean I'd remember some numbers but uh I let the computer figure out where things were supposed to be we've done some stair videos in the past but um I don't know that we' ever had anything goes up to a specific spot creates a landing uh so the big thing to remember here was I guess this ended up being a how to do math and figure out where stuff is when you don't know how to do the math or figure out where the stuff goes um the big thing of course was The Landing requirements that's why we did all that kind of chalk line stuff on the ground and then uh just pulled our way up and in a couple minutes kind of had at that full staircase and I think everything's right there I apologize like I said you're going to do it anyway so yeah sure point out in the comments where I missed a requirement or something like that I won't be offended um but hopefully if you watch this the part that you caught which you actually came away with was how to use the software to do the modeling and the stuff rather than uh oh Aaron doesn't know what the minimum whatever thing I screwed up was so but hey if you like that go ahead and throw that out there too why not it'll be fun it's a comment you know take it if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please do leave us a comment down below uh if you got something out of this we'd love to hear what that is if you have a better way of doing this something that you've come across that other people haven't done let us know about that too and finally if you have an idea for a video for something we haven't done you think would be a good video we'd love to hear that we like making these videos a lot but we'd like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
