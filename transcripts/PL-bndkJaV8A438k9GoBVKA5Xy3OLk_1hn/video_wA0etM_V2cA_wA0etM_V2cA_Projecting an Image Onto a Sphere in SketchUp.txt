hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about projecting images on the Spheres so we're going to look at a couple of options actually to get a sphere we we'll make a quick sphere and uh I want to make it look like a pool ball so something that just you know literally printed on a sphere nothing nothing else uh and we're look at a couple different options we have some native tool well it's all Native tools but we have a way to actually like color and paint stuff that we don't have to to use an image but then I want to take a look at taking an image and having it wrap around uh something like a ball so let's uh let's make some pool balls right now all right first thing of course we're going to need is we are going to need a sphere so uh a while back I did a video on creating a sphere in six seconds uh I'm probably Rusty now so let's let's uh let's give it a shot uh it's two commands it is a circle and it is follow me so I'm just going to go ahead and grab a circle going to draw two circles one on the ground here one on the in the air right here grab this bottom one say follow me grab this one and we have a sphere all right so I'm going to make a couple copies of this sphere real quick I'm going say move option and do like uh 2x something like that okay so I want a to take these spheres and I want to make them look like pool balls uh you know the obvious one to go for is the eightball everybody you know whatever Geeks out on the eightball but I want to do a number four ball why a number four ball because purple's my favorite color and four is the like perfect shade of purple so uh I'm going to start by importing an image so I'm going to go file import and right off my desktop here I'm just going to grab this picture of a four and just drop it just double click to place it right there all right so this is what we're going for uh you've got a white circle in the middle the rest of it this nice purple color black four in there so before we actually talk about projecting this I do want to just see what I can do with the modeling tools so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to say View and show me my hidden geometry right so if I look at this I can see that I I have stuff broken into segments here right um so what I could do is I could come in with the paint bucket tool grab that bring it over here I could grab this nice purple color and if I wanted to I could actually come in here and start like coloring these segments in um I got that I don't got time for that so what I'm going to do instead is I'm going to come to a side view like this I'm going to zoom out a little bit and I'm going to grab a select window and I'm just going to grab guess like that much and that's going to select everything except these top two segments here and the bottom two segments here and then I can grab that same purple color and I can tap here oops I didn't go back into the uh command got you do have to actually tell it what command as good as we try to make software it doesn't read mins yet so I do have to say and tap the paint bucket tool to get that and all right so we're we're about halfway there uh if I go to view and turn off my H geometry all right I'm I'm pretty close to a four ball right now I'm going to need some text in here obviously the four there so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use 3D text to do this I'm going to go to tools and I'm going to grab my 3D text I'm going to type a you guys already figured out a four I could go through I I could spend some time finding the perfect text for this but in my afternoon of perusing four balls on the internet I found that fonts change so there may be official like I don't know pool guy world I don't know I don't know if the official controlling body is for pool ball creation but there may be an official font I personally I'm good with whatever this is times that's fine let's go ahead and do that I'm going to place it I know this isn't going to be the right size I'm just going to drop it on the ground here and then I'm going to come in here with scale and I'm going to start by making it taller and then uh let's also make it bigger let's just uniformly that's fine uh it's probably a little too tall okay so something like that might be I don't there may also be like you know a rule for how big the four is compared to the rest of the ball but uh I don't know I'm going to eyeball it nailed it all right so that looks pretty good that's that's about where I want it to be awesome uh so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to select this surface I'm going to right click I'm going to say intersect face with model that means any place that this surface intersects any geometry in the rest of the model it's going to break so when I do that I'm just going to take this and I'm going to drop it straight down so it pokes out the other side and then I'm going to go back to color grab my black there we go all right so we got a pretty good four ball there the other side of course is going to be well pretty much the same thing except obviously I'm not a math guy but I don't think that four is right so we're going to want to flip that of course so what I could do I this a couple different ways I guess there's actually all right I'm thinking of a lot of different ways I'm going to use select to pick it go to move and then just use the the this to flip it around like that flip it to 180 degrees awesome and then same thing I can can select this intersect face with model erase this fill that with black all right so there we go so I I could I can make a four ball with just modeling tools but let's take a look now how we might go about putting this image onto this ball instead all right so I'm going to bring this over here I'm going to lay it right underneath doesn't that doesn't have to be perfect well actually you know if you have the option perfect is always nice you know lining things up perfectly when possible is kind of cool and with inferencing I'm just going to grab the edges the middle points of both sides of the image and line it up with the center point of this ball now I'm going to hit scale and I'm going to modifier key to scale around the middle and just drop this down so it's almost that images almost smaller proba should go a little bit bigger just slightly larger than the ball itself now this currently isn't a sampl image or or samp material so I can't apply this so if I come into my paint bucket tool I can't say pick this see I get that little no sign it tells me uhuh that's the that's the title of that little circle with a line through it it's called a uh-uh so I get a uh-uh when I come in here to do that what I have to do a couple things I'm going to want to do here so first I'm going to select right click and I'm going to explode an image an image is just a texture that is on a surface that is locked into a special group once I explode it this just becomes a face that has a material on it the other thing I'm going to want to do is right click on just the image now you saw there before everything was highlighted I'm going to deselect pick just the image right click texture and I want to make sure projected is turned on projected says when I apply this to something it's going to like a projector push this image all the way across a material or a surface so with that I'm going to say Paint Bucket select see my my uh's gone I can just pick this material apply it right here and look at that I got a good looking four ball right there if I flip around the other side I'm going to see a thing that I'm not necessarily going to like uh I can just actually I can delete this I don't need this material anymore my Four's backwards over here see that so that's not ideal what do I do about that well let's let me let me think of some solutions uh one thing I could do is I could modify the geometry let's do that let's let's go ahead and go to view turn on our hidden geometry I'll look at it right from the side and I'm going to select the bottom half then I'm going to right click and I'm going to say erase get rid of that I'm going to temporarily make this a group because I'm going to use rotate to flip this copy I'm going to hit option to make a copy and there we go now I have for facing the right way four is facing the right way well if I wanted to I could I guess I could do this too I don't actually again I don't know what direction if the two fours are supposed to be the same way mine's upside down but they're both the same um at that point probably take those two make them into their own group I should probably triple click make this into a grouper component also but uh yeah so there we go I'm going to turn my hidden geometry back off I'm curious it's not quite centered on there but uh looks like my circle my guess of of two rings of the circle is about the right size all right so with that and again it doesn't matter that that's off center because as soon as I go to uh my view and turn off my in Geometry you know that's what's important but there we go so we have a couple options there for how we might want to create that uh four ball I I got a white ball here just because you know I wanted I wanted to paint a q ball too so knock that one out quick but there we go yeah so there's a couple different ways to go about creating uh a surface that wraps all the way around a sphere now there is some important stuff here uh when does wrap it's not actually wrapping so I said wrap but really it's projecting like I said it's projecting right onto it so if you have an image that doesn't fully cover the circle when you project you might get weird edges uh you know if you have a square where the image go out the side it's going to distort a little bit uh something like this is perfect because by the time it gets out the outside edges is just materials we have a little bit of reflectivity and stuff going on up here but it's really just that material that goes around the outside um but it's a great way to use projected and and on a on a Surface like a sphere you know it shows just how easy that is to do I hope you like that hopefully you liked that video If so click like down below and let us know that uh if you're not already subscribed please do subscribe too we create several videos each and every week and to be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment Down Below have you done something like this before have you used a different process a different method is there something that you think would make a good video that we should know about we like making these videos a lot we' like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank
