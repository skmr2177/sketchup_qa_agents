hey everybody Eric here and today I want to share with you how to make your construction details go from Flat to Fab using just sketchup's native tools so we've most of us in the environmental design industry whether you're in landscape or in um architecture or even interior design you're probably going to come across construction details one way or another whether you're working with them in SketchUp to build something in 3D or going the opposite so taking something from 3D and going to construction documents I want to kind of look at the difference now between going again the traditional method which is just kind of cutting a section slice or looking at something in plan View and drafting it in two Dimensions like something you'd see in AutoCAD and then instead going a little bit further which is adding some depth adding some Shadow and some texture and some realism and then of course you know looking at it from different angles so that we're getting one detail in a way can actually become multiple details so let's just go ahead and get to it so this is here what uh I've got it's a finished detail but I want to kind of start here like for example this is a landscape planter wall and stair and again this process doesn't have to be for landscape it can be for architecture or Interiors as well it just happens to be a model that I had details that I had access to and um you can see that now you know this tells us pretty much everything we need to know know but it's looking at one slice so if you were to draft this in CAD you would have to do this slice for this one and then you'd have to slice it again through the wall you'd have to do a separate one for plan View and I'm just wanting to do sort of one that then I can get multiple um pieces of content out of so I'm going to pop over here to my axo so you can see the difference here between the sort of 2D and the 3D so all the same information obviously there's some text call outs that I wouldn't do in SketchUp I would do those in layout and we'll do another video on that uh soon but you can see you've got all the information about what's happening with the footings I think I have something here that I had hidden so I'll just make sure that everything is of course showing and that's how easy it is just pop into that group and there it is so now this is an example of one where I had the detail and actually modeled from the detail but let's look at it let's look at sort of if we were starting from scratch so I want to take this away and I want to kind of look at at let's see here let's really quick take away that section cut so we can do that over again and let's look at for example this may be pulled from my model meaning that like this could be part of a bigger model so this doesn't have to necessarily be built just as a construction detail this could be built um as part of my model and I can just grab the stair and grab the planter and the handrail and all of the things that come with it and I can just copy those either into a new file or copy it off to the side you know you may or may not want want to use the entire model and add construction details to it because you know you may want to modify it you know and you want it to be a little bit different because again construction details sort of read um a little bit different than how you might have it um before so let's pretend like we're not let's pretend here for a second I'm going to go ahead and take this out there we go I don't want to jump to the next step let's pretend like we are starting from scratch I grabbed the stair and the handrail and the planter from my model and I copied it into a new model first thing I might want to do is come over here to tools and section plane now you can add a section plane on the outside the problem is if you had multiple details then what it's going to do it's going to cut through everything right so as a safer bet you may want to actually go into whatever group that you want to show a section cut through and do that same thing tools section plane use the arrow keys if you want to align it you know to an axis and then there you go and what's cool about that is then what I can do is if I wanted to just cut a section through in this case the stair so I can see what's happening underneath it I can do that fairly easily um without interfering with sort of like the other geometry like the handrails and things like that so now I've got a keyboard shortcut you can come over here and go view section planes I've got a keyboard shortcut for that just kind of allows me to toggle that on and off and then this is where you get to kind of decide here I purposefully extended these handrails um the post for the handrail a little bit lower so I kind of want to start there I'm going to let's see example I'm not going to do the whole detail I'm just going to do part of it but for example I'm hitting the modifier which is option alt and then I'm using the left Arrow key to make sure that I'm aligned to the green axis that way I'm getting a rectangle that is centered here and if I want to bring that up again I'm going to just make sure to snap that there I'll push use Push Pull to pull that back and you could leave that you could just use a rectangle and cut this out or you could offset it you know or I could kind of do something a little bit fancier let's see if this works is come over here and use something like the the um use something like the circle tool and I'll show you why here because what I want to do is I want to remove this piece to show that there's some space around it but in order to do that I kind of need to pull up this Arc which is a half circle and then when I delete that face maybe even take these and reverse these come over here reverse those turn the Shadows off just so you can see that so if I turn my hidden geometry on you can see that I've got that Arc there and it just gives a little bit more depth when you look at it straight on so if I change my camera to um if I wanted to show this almost like as a traditional detail I could set the camera to parallel projection and then you can see that depending on your light settings so your Shadow settings depending on where your shadows are hitting you're getting that depth that's coming in there and that's actually kind of cool I'm also using SketchUp version 2024 so you can see here if I go to edit and then my faces you can see the difference that the ambient occlusion makes maybe I'll back out a little bit so you can see that now again whether you like the sort of flat style um that works too and then you can add that ambient inclusion and especially works well when you switch your style to um for example hidden line style you can see that you still get that all that cool depth and stuff and I'm really liking the way that looks so let me go back let me leave all that stuff alone go back to textures make sure am inclusions on Okay cool so speaking of styles and surfaces and textures so once I get this done here I can group that or make it a component depending on how I want to use this again and then inside of that I'm going to open up under not my crayons here which these are Mac OS a lot of people asks where these come from these come from the Mac operating system so if you're on PC it looks a little bit different what I want to point out here is under patterns you get some kind of cool things that look a little bit like construction details they lines and there's textures and there's just things but more on a um almost like a handrawn or a cad drawn look so what I want to do is look for this one kind of here and I can apply that to the concrete so I apply that to everything within there and then that gives it kind of a concrete looking uh texture which I think let me switch my camera angle which I think looks pretty cool now depending on how you model this you can also come over here and I'm I'm going to copy this I'm going to delete it and I was kind of thinking ahead so I made this handrail um I made this a component so if I go in and place this in go up here to edit paste in place you can see that if only by uh pasting it one time and it shows up wherever this handrail shows up uh the footing will the concrete footer or footing will show up as well so now there's more to it here obviously um depending on whether you're making this up from what you know how it's going to be built or whether you're using construction detail as a reference like I showed in the beginning let me go go ahead and just undo that last step because I already have all of these things in here so if I turn this on I can come over here and say unhide and for whatever reason that one stays likes to stay hidden so I'll unhide that and I will turn off that so that's again super cool like I said in the beginning um you can look at it a few different ways you can look at it in a in axonometric you can look at it in elevation again I probably want to take the uh camera perspective out of that or you can look at it in this case in plan View and then you just turn that section off and then depending on how you've set up your file like in this case I have 2D plants and I have 3D plants um 2D as an assemble and 3D as in a face me it's not actually 3D it's they're both 2D you get what I'm saying it's kind of cool CU then I can look at this in plan View and I can look at this again I can look at styling it and then when I'm ready I can send this off to layout and add my annotations I wouldn't do that here so that's it you can see here if I move this around whether you are cutting a section through it whether you're showing the footer whether you're adding plants and details and notes and things like that it's really up to you on how much information you want to show the cool thing about this again like I said in the beginning is that once you get it into 3D you can choose after the fact how many different views you think you need to explain how this particular planter needs to be built or can be built and I just love the idea of having options as always and choice and control so if I just cut that one section and then I find myself contractor ask questions later you know this really helps kind of just add that extra level of detail and polish and dimension to your construction details so I'm I'm going to let you go there I'm going to say thanks as always for watching let us know what you think in the comments below uh have you used this method have you tried it are you worried about it does it is there something do you just like CAD it's okay we can um I won't tell anyone so let us know in the comments and we will see you next time [Music]
