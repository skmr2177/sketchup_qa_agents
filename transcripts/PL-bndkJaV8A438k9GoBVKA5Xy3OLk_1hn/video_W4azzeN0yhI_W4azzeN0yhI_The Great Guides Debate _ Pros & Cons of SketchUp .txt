hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about guides good or [Music] bad so those of you who've seen me model before know that I'm uh on the the the the I don't really care for guides that much I just don't use them very much and part of it is just how I learned to model my process that I go through uh guides never made it into that but I've also run into spots where they've kind of gotten in the way but because of multiple requests from you our viewers I have gone back and taken another look at guides and with that I want to present some information that maybe guides aren't so bad after all they might have some good uses so this is guides good or bad what we're going to look at here is I just have a couple of faces they're just a couple of rectangles on the ground so obviously the way guides work in here I click tape measure I click on an edge I pull that wherever I want I type a specific Dimension or I can just uh click a line where I want and I get that line I I can that guide goes in and I can reference that and if I want to I can come back and I can draw along that guide I can also use the intersection point between that guide and other things that and when I'm done done here's the nice piece about it this piece right here is one piece right so if I gra Push Pull and push that up I'm pushing that whole thing up the alternative to this of course is to come in and do something like grab this Edge right here and maybe I will move it over instead so I get that line at the same spot um I could also do something like come to this point say I want to come over 4 in take 4 inches enter and then pick up that point and draw a line across like that give me the a similar thing to what I got going on here um lines of course edges I can connect together just like I mean this is drawing with edges the downside here is this is now two separate surfaces so over here where I could grab this one surface and just pull it right up over here I'd have to do two and then probably come in here and clean this up again so this is the big difference right here is that guides don't break faces edges immediately break faces because this is what they're designed to do this is everything is acting according to plan right now so um the thing that gets to me again this is this is my personal thing is I don't like these edges shooting off in the middle of nowhere uh but it's it's really kind of becomes nitpicky at this point this really comes down down to how did I teach myself how to model and sketch up which is what I did uh and I was always drawing edges like this and accepting the stuff was going to break and then if I came in and deleted something like this this surface would heal and I'd have this here it is an extra step though it's not the best way to do it with with guides this piece is already two or one piece because it never got broken because guides don't break geometry the other thing I complain about these edges being here these lines being here um I could always grab these and put them you know put my guides onto a tag or something like that but I don't even have to do that because I can go into view and I can turn guides off at any time and they all go away regardless of context whether they're inside a group outside a group whatever I can just switch them off so my argument that oh these these guides are in the way I don't like this and we've all seen anybody who seen models from 3D Warehouse or has that that one person they know that that models with a lot of guides knows that spiderweb look where they got 100 guides floating all over the place but realistically even complaining about that's kind of silly because it's just so simple to toggle it off like that and to that end I also have this button to delete all guides so again regardless of context I can hit delete all guides and they're gone from my model so if I'm going to post something up on 3D Warehouse or whatever I could do that and you know that would be simple enough to to clean up so my complaint about how guides get in the way and I don't like the way they look is not really a valid I'm arguing against myself right now yes not really a valid concern because I have those those options where I can toggle guides on and off and I can delete all Guides of my model with the click of a button it's kind of silly add that to the fact that it doesn't break geometry and there's a lot of cases where simple geometry like this is great for using guides so is there situations where guides aren't ideal well I'm glad I asked so over here I have uh some geometry uh these are just kind of same rect similar rectangles just raised up um guides do work the same they work in 3D so I can grab this Edge and I pull it this way or I could grab this Edge and I could pull it down like that so I can go in three dimensions it's not like limited to a face or anything like that um again I can same thing though I can draw I could draw a line I could grab this midpoint and draw an edge across there so everything works the same um the danger of breaking geometry in my experience increases as you're working in 3D 2D it's pretty easy to clean stuff up not a big deal once you get into 3D like this though um the possibility of messing your geometry up where you have to go back and once beyond that when you have more geometry touching other geometry right when I have something like this it comes over something like that now I have connecting geometry and if I start drawing lines to reference um I'm breaking this geometry all over the place and it's connected geometry you know might cause issues with guides you don't have to worry about that so this is a spot where I don't really I don't know I have a harder time uh what am I saying I I don't know I'm I'm I'm I'm having I have a harder time saying you shouldn't create guides once you get in here in because it is so much quicker and easier look how quick and easy that was that's awesome it it is it it really is an easier way to break up your geometry now there is I'm going to undo a bunch of times because I do have one use case where making faces making edges is easier and that is with offset so if I grab offset I can come in here to this and I can just say oops that's scale I grabbed the wrong one offset so I come in here offset I have four edges they're pulled in I'm done doing that with guides that's just it's not impossible it's a little more work because I have to pull each side in type the dimension pull each side in type the dimension that sort of thing actually I'll type the dimension because it'll snap the same side so not terrible but this is a four-sided shape if I was doing a floor plan or something like that and I wanted to offset the whole thing it'd be a little more work but not terrible but it is quicker but even that so we're going go a little bit deeper how does that get get uh see look look at my guides getting in my way over here I'm just kidding let get quick so right here if I wanted to get a reference of you know what would this look like an inch in I could do that I could put one right there to do that with guides well there's not way there's there's no circular guide so like taking that even further if I wanted to do something like this I don't have that option with guides now depending on what you actually want to do why do I want that I could still you know assimilate the the snap points that I need for guides right because i' come in here and I could say you know give me a guide right along the middle and then then that this way too and then I have that midpoint referenced and then if the the thing is I need okay now I need to pull this out whatever couple of inches I could grab a guy like that and then pull the same thing this way and I could in theory you know get a square reference around where that circle is so there's still an option for guides in this situation um where I could get the if inferenced dimensions the dimensions I want to refer to I could throw in with guides so it is possible no I can't get this nice clean offset where every Edge is represented on this on the inset line no I can't do it with Corners are rounded like this but if the information itself is as simple as how far in is that yeah I'm not getting the uh exact um the corners aren't going to be exact this way but I could do that so it so it's it's it's not a question I guess I'm talking to myself it's less a question of in imitating the exact information you'd get with edges it's more about getting the information you need from the guide instead so worth considering check out guides if you don't use guides please don't use me as a reason you don't use guides because I'm I'm having a hard time arguing why guides aren't good and remember again I come over here I toggle guides off so I can see just my geometry if I want uh super easy to work with so yeah uh I don't know I guess I guess I'm still out I'm still I still haven't decided if guides are great or if they get in the way uh I'm not 100% sure so there you go you can see I I I I'm arguing with myself and I appreciate you guys sitting through this argument but realistically what I'm struggling with is at this point why don't I use guides I mean they're there I'm not trying to sell you anything they've always been there I just have never put them in this my part of my workflow and I'm really struggling to figure out why I don't do more of that so I kind of might I think I might have talked myself into using guides more uh I guess come check it out come to our next live stream we do live streams Friday at noon mountain time um and let me know uh catch me if if there's a spot I could be using guides and I'm not let me know so maybe I can implement this more but uh guides seem to be great they don't break geometry they they are toggleable I can turn them on and off real quickly and easily maybe I'm going to be one of those guys who creates a spider web of guides and uh maybe I'm a guides guy I don't know we'll see we'll have to figure it out if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do hit subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below did I miss a use case for guides that you like to use or do you have an argument for or against guides or are you keeping an eye on me and do you need to remind me of where I should be using guides if so it's all welcome in the comments we like making these videos a lot we'd like to even more when they showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
