hey guys I'm Erin and today we're going to talk about the common conceptions or misconceptions or thoughts on painting faces or groups and components so there's actually some pretty uh strong opinions about this topic out there in the world um I want to just talk about how painting on faces versus objects groups and components is different and then we'll talk a little bit more about why that can be an issue and where it can bite you a little bit so let's hop in okay so I'm here in desktop and I have my colors window open over here and my entity info open over here so real quickly real simply I I have this little little super simple house structure I want to keep this simple so you understand exactly what's going on so I have some faces here you see I picked the face it says it's a face it has the default color on there the front and the back white on front and then presumably I can't see inside the gray color on the back but this is I'm just going to go ahead and say nine times out of ten when you're applying colors to your model you should be doing it at this level that means if this is in a group you should double click to enter the group and then come in here to paint if I put red walls on here like that green roof click like that this is the level you should ideally be uh painting in and you can always use the the modifier keys well look at the bottom there we did a a square one video last year that showed all these different modifier Keys how they work check that out if you have any questions but um yeah so basically if you are going to apply materials this is the view to do it from right here just when you're in there where you can go to select and you can pick on a face that's where you should be applying materials now let's take a step over here so right here I have two groups so if I pick on one of them it says they're groups you can see their groups right here um if I grab that same red color I'm in paint bucket and I come click on that same front face look what happens the whole thing turns red and on top of that over here you can see in my entity info it's the info lists this whole group as being read all right now I'm going to double click on this group and I'm going to pick that front face and it tells me the front face is wait a minute it has the default material so this right here what we're looking at right here is the problem that people have when they get a model from somebody else and there's material applied to components rather than faces is it can be very very confusing because what I could do is I can come in here right now grab my blue and apply blue to these two faces so now if I pick one of these faces that's blue that's blue pick the red it's white and I come back out to the outside pick it it says the whole group is red but half of it's blue this is the confusion when you're painting groups and objects instead of faces because what it's telling me is any face that doesn't have a different material applied is going to look red so when I come in here this face with nothing applied is going to get red same here on here I kind of did like a material override you could call it and I told it don't use whatever the default material is use blue instead so both faces became blue this is what gets confusing now there are reasons you might want to use this right so here's my my second group totally different group you can see on here I have shingles painted on the roof but nothing on the walls what I could do using this knowing that if I come in here these faces have those shingles applied to them and then the rest of the house doesn't this means what I could do is I could grab a color I could grab green and click anywhere in the group even on the shingled part and it's going to apply any material that does not have another but or any face that does not have another material applied to it is going to get that green so what does my house look like if I paint it blue what if I painted my house red and I can go through and visualize like this real quick and I don't have to worry about like click of Facebook and Facebook and Facebook and Facebook Facebook instead it's only going to take those so if you're intentional when you create your groups and you put materials on some materials or you put materials on some faces but not others you can end up in a situation like this which is you know an easy way to to do that kind of visualization now that doesn't fix the issue so if I come in here and I select this it tells me everything's pink but obviously everything's not pink because I'm looking at shingles right here and here I go inside it tells me this is white because the face itself is white but it's deferring to the color of the object the group on the outside whereas this face has this material applied to it so it's not taking the color of the material of the group it's kind of like there's a hierarchy right so with a group any face that is not have something applied it's going to use whatever the group color is any face where it's specifically applied it's going to use that instead so this can be confusing this is where people run into problems especially if you're sharing models if I'm going to take my model pass to somebody else and I give this to them and they're like wait a minute this is red that could be confusing so generally speaking we're gonna I'm just going to keep panning back over here this is the ideal way to do it is to paint faces and then at some point I can triple click make this a group if I make it a group it's going to tell me there's no colors applied but if I come in each face has its own color so this is is generally speaking the safest way to apply colors now we've talked about faces we've talked about groups what about components well this adds a whole another wrinkle right components are connected together so any change I make to one of these is going to apply to all of them that's just how component works that's not part of this lesson that's just explanation same goes with color so if I double click and come in here and I grab this red color to put on the roof all copies of that component are going to get red on the outside now we've talked about this in other videos components will reflect anything that happens inside the container to all instances that's why when I painted red I I double clicked to open I painted red that copied to everything else if I grab the outside of a component component and make a change like I scale it it's not going to change the others because I didn't change what was inside same goes for colors so if I grab blue and I apply it to this component this component instance that this one is blue this one over here still White so I grab green and put it on here pink put it on here guess what they're all still the same components but the outside of the component has a different color applied so if I come in here and I change my roof to Brown that's going to go across all the copies of the component whereas the color that is painted on the outside still stays separate so again this is a tool you can leverage very similar to how I did it over here with groups it is something else you can leverage but at the same time this can be confusing to other people using the model so again if you're working by yourself and you know you have a system you've got it down you you do this no problem if this is you're working in collaboratively with other people you may trip up on this if nothing else it might be worth just you know coming up with a standard for how you do this but again I'm going to just keep just One Last Time come over here the ideal way to apply materials is the face because you don't have any issues with the materials showing up different from what they actually are on the face so with that explanation hopefully it's clear but you can see why it's not simple straightforward oh yeah yeah just do this then this it will let you when you start coloring things like components and groups it will let you create kind of a mess so it is important to note what you're doing and pay attention again if you're working collaboratively and you work with a partner or something you guys have a standard way of doing uh colors and materials then you know if that's cool work that out you guys make a system leverage it awesome but if somebody doesn't know and they look at something they're like this says it's white but for whatever reason it's blue that could be a little bit confusing hope you like that video if so go ahead click like down below
