hey y'all my name is Tyson and this is part two of using the scale tool as a modeling technique yes that's right so we do have another video released just prior to this one where we go into using the scale tool to manipulate geometry pull geometry out scale it up and down and in that one we stayed very symmetrical and cylindrical but in this one we're going to break away from that and do some different shapes and this plain example will be a good option to practice on so let's have a look this should be pretty interesting we have for example this bent wing and some things to try but let's start back here with the tail because this will a good way to introduce the simple idea like before we're simply pulling out a shape then selecting that new shape and using the scale tool to scale either side or from the center then we pull this out some more but rather than scaling from the center all the time which we were doing previously this time we may be scaling from one side or the other we might be scaling from the center but it's a little more freeform modeling as we move along now if you get to a curve like this you might add more steps in here than what I'm going to do because we're just going to keep kind of showing this idea but you can see here and and get the general idea of how this works maybe one more scale it from the center and of course we could come back in and select any of these and tweak tweak them as needed even select uh you know several and say let's bring these all Downs make that thinner but even though this is you know fairly low geometry if we were to smooth these edges it still looks pretty good so you again you can add more steps um and make this look even smoother along this curve but that's the basic idea is just using that scale tool pulling out sometimes using move let's try that again this time we'll see uh about building out this Wing a little bit I'm going to select this profile make a component and I'm going to do that so that I can make a copy of it and start manipulating it down here where I can see this now depending on how you set up your reference photos you may not need to do this because you might set these up a line better but this will be fine I'm going to align that a little better and maybe move it down just so it's close we just want to get the idea here so let's say we bring this down and we scale this a little bit and you may or may not if you're actually punching through your reference like I am need to turn x-ray mode on somewhat frequently but so we've scaled that in a little bit made our wing a little thinner now we pull that out a little more I'm going to turn this I'm going to try and turn this with uh not too much detail just in the interest of time but you might make a few more transitions but let's rotate this and see if we can move it up a little bit back okay I'm going to do that once more and now here you can see it's it's doing something a little weird it doesn't have if we look at Hidden geometry it doesn't necessarily have the geometry to move in the direction I want it to often when you use the scale tool it will create a whole bunch of Auto fold lines for you and you can move it around but if need be we may invoke autofold to move it where we want now let's say we want to scale this from here so if I hit the scale tool you can see that the grips are not aligned with that surface and if I wanted to scale it just say from the center but maintain that that plane this isn't going to work so there's a couple things we could try here one thing that's always good to at least see how well it works is say a line axis this is going to align the axis with this surface right I'm right clicking on the surface say a line axis and now if I hit the scale tool it is aligned with that surface now it still may not fully be what I want maybe I want it to be more aligned with the length of this Wing segment so if that's the case we may come back here and just say Let's either grab the access tool or I'll right click on an axis line hit place and then I will manually set the axis now if I hit the scale tool it's aligned pretty well I like that and I could let's say manipulate this Wing a little bit more let's add one more Bend to this and then we'll have that curve finished out so if I take this I'm going to scale it a little bit and I definitely want to be a little more careful of my reference photos but we're just trying to do the rough version here again the autofold is preventing it so I'm going to toggle my auto fold with the move tool and rotate this something like that should be pretty close that looks alright again if I hit the scale tool it's not aligned so I'm going to test a line axis probably I wanted again manually place this axis and that should now if I hit the scale tool that should give me a good starting point for the rest of this so if I scale this down now I'd want to reference this other photo of course but that is the idea is that we can continue working on this and shaping this wing once we've changed this axis a couple times it's going to ask us if we want to have that as our new axis for the entire component we're changing it several times you may or may not want to do that but that's the general idea another thing to be aware of when I am looking at this and the axis is different if I wanted to go to a top view to say model this wing if I look at the top view here that may not be what you expect because it's showing me the top view of this changed axis so I'm going to stop editing that component of the top view maybe toggle perspective off and then come back in to this I may have changed that axis so it may not do what I need but that's the idea generally now one thing that we did and this is a bit of a mistake that I'd want to go back and kind of undo if we look at our geometry here when I was scaling this geometry and extending it it doesn't always leave a a line here so for example if I align the axis scale from the center pull again well we did get one but depending on if you scale just from one side you may not create that line now ideally this is you know flat so we could simply fix this by drawing it in but you may need to go back um now stitching but you may need to go back always just be careful of that you have edges to work from or you can have some geometry like that so we need to take some more time to fix this up and make sure this Wing looks good um but that's the idea we'll leave it there for now one final thing that I want to talk about when using this scale method when we're doing the wing you know we may take this make it a component mirror it to the other side but the fuselage we could either do as a mirrored component or we could do as one object that we're scaling and we just want to make sure we're preserving the center in everything we do so we just want to be very careful that we don't do something like this where I scale from the other side if I look at Hidden geometry I've pulled a wave that's that Center Point so maintain that Center Line so if I scale this scale this down and so forth see I I wasn't careful I'd want to scale from the center and then scale from here it's it's pretty easy to uh you know as you're learning this method to make mistakes like that and you'll learn pretty quickly after you've done a few of these and you'll say oops I better go back and manipulate that a little differently so maintain that Center Line when you do here's one if I said that was the last tip here's maybe the last last tip or suggestion this um if it if you have a pretty cylindrical shape that you're working with it can work fine but depending on the profile you may have something like this where it comes to more of a point and again maybe we are creating this as a mirrored component so let's create a component out of this version and let's create a component out of this version and pull them both up similarly so I'm going to take this flip it and do the same here but on one of these because these are different components what I want to show is that when you have a point that is at your Center Line you may this is a personal preference but you may want to come in and resolve that in a way that it is that comes in perpendicular on both sides something like that just a little bit even just so slightly and the reason you may want to do that when I bring this up and I select this and I start to scale it I scaled in and I bring it up some more oh I got to be careful where I'm scaling from if I did something similar here so I bring it up scale it back scale it in full scale so I'm going to turn up in geometry and over here let's hide those center lines and let's smooth some of these others and then we'll do the same over here hide the center lines and smooth smoothies this is primarily visual but what you can see is that we still can see that Ridge pretty predominantly now you may know that one thing that could help that is to come in and delete that interior surface and we could do that here as well but even when we do that because this came to a point we kind of have this visual Ridge line now if that's something you wanted that would of course be great but just that little bit of an edge here makes this transition smooth so be aware based on how you draw your profiles that can you may want to have just a little bit a small Edge that will bring those two mirrored components together in a nice parallel way where they meet as opposed to a Ridgeline okay was that um I hope that was I hope that made sense we sort of jumped around there and and I get it this topic this technique of using the scale tool I love it I it's so much fun even after you've practiced fit for a while you'll still sometimes mess up and scale from the wrong grip and and have to fix some things but it opens up a lot of different shapes and objects that you can model using this technique and I wanted to sort of just introduce a couple of the things that you might run into like again changing the Axis or using mirrored components together go have fun with it if you have questions on it please let us know we'll try to answer and as always if you have questions or suggestions for future topics let us know please do subscribe give us that like if you so like and uh thanks y'all we'll see you next time
