Hey guys, it's Eron and today I want to take a look at what it takes to import an existing image and make it a PBR in [Music] SketchUp. So PBR is kind of the fancy way of saying really good-looking materials. That's what PBR stands for is really good looking materials. So, in the most recent versions of SketchUp, 2025 or later, we have the ability to assign material properties to imported images that were being used as textures. And we're take a look at how to do that right now. All right. So, I actually have a couple, excuse me, of images that I want to try importing and making materials out of. So, right here, I'm in a default template. The only materials that are in here right now are what is on TomTom. Uh, I drew a couple of extruded rectangles. One's upright, one's laying down because I want to bring in some wall covering and some flooring. So, we start by importing the same way as any previous version. I'm going to go to file. I'm going to say import. Um, going to grab I have this orange peel texture. Not like an actual orange, but like a a knockdown. It should be probably called knockdown texture on my walls here. It's drywall texture. I'm going go ahead and import that. It's going to come in on my So, you can see this is this is the the material I'm importing. So, I'm going to go ahead and drag it right here. I'm going to drag it up till it's I don't know about the right scale. We'll we'll end up scaling it later. So, I'm just going to bring it in like that. Click. And there we go. So, that material when it first comes in, if I double click on this, you see that any imported material I'm going to actually use my arrow key toclick that so we don't have the blue dots all over it. But if I click into that material, you can see default material gets imported with a metalness and a roughness. This is a hard not this is a default that I have set up. So if you go into your settings, settings are located under SketchUp on Mac. They're in the window menu on Windows. But if you come in here, uh, if I go to I oh, I forget where it where this is. Right here under graphics down at the bottom, I have the automatically enhanced materials. If these boxes are checked, then imported materials are automatically going to get a 0.13 metalness and a.5 roughness. It's global. Anytime you import, it's going to defer to this. It doesn't look at it and say based on what it is, it's going to change it. Right now, it's just whatever is set up here. So, here I am. Here's my material, my 0.13 metalness, my uh 0.5 roughness, and that's what came in. So, I can adjust those. I can drop my roughness down. I can increase my metalness, make it shiny, which would be weird for drywall, but you can see there, see how it interacts with my environmental lighting. Um, so that's okay. So, for some materials, that might be enough. If I'm importing like wood, it's nice finished wood, and I want to get some shine on it. That might be good. In some cases though, I might want to go a little bit further. You could manually, if you had a normal map, an ambient occlusion map saved as an image, you could manually come in and import those right there. I could actually click that on and then go tell it what uh map to use. Um, another option is this little little sparkly button right here. This is generate material. So what this will do is this will use AI to generate a new texture based on the image here. So it will look at the image, it will look at the name I have given it and it will try to create a seamlessly tiling material and automatically generate roughness and normal maps. So we're going to go ahead and hit that. Uh this does take just a second or two because it is going out to that place of mystery, the cloud, and it is processing this image, running it through AI stuff. Magic, magic, magic. And then it will res bring us a result from there. Um you know, it's always fun making videos on AI because you never really know what you're going to get until you hit the button and then uh we got to work from there. The interesting thing too about working with AI is this is a work in progress. The AI engine is processing materials every day and getting better at it. So what you get from material today might not be the same material you get tomorrow. And in fact, if I don't like what uh the generator gave me right now, I can just go to file un or edit undo and get back and then hit the button again and it's going to run it through again. You may not get drastically different uh solutions when you run it backto back. But if I run it now versus two or three days from now versus a week from now versus a month from now, I may actually get different results because the AI is learning as all the users are going through and running this uh this thing. Okay, so here's what I got. So I can see a little bit of a repetition. So it is seamless. You can see it is all stacking together. But there is, and this is this is probably based on my photo, the the ideal material photo to bring in, of course, has the same colors, top, bottom, left, and right edges. Uh, is easier to seam together because I had a little bit of a shadow at the top of mine. I can see that shadow kind of carried through, but not bad. Um, it does, what I found is it does scale material based on what it thinks, what it thinks it should show. So, a lot of times the first thing I will do once I get done here is rightclick texture position and then use my handles to maybe scale that to what I think is a better material. I'm going to go a little bit large just so we can see the material better uh on this video. But, uh there you go. You can see it did give us that t that uh tiling material. Uh it did give us a map. Sorry, I should go back in here. It did give us both a normal and ambient occlusion maps. You can see as you're moving around, see how the light plays and jumps in there. It looks I mean it looks like we have varnished drywall texture here. So, that's not ideal, but we'll deal with that in a second. Um, so it looks like what it did was it turned off metalness. So, I don't have any metalness. If I did turn it on, I'd get that sheen that I don't really want. So, metalness off is probably good. I would probably, if I was looking at this, I would probably crank up my roughness because it's right now it's looking a little shiny. So, I'd probably come up like fairly aggressively. Uh, depending on the finish on my walls, you know, if I have more of a a shiny finish, a gloss finish, then I'd probably come over here. If I have more of a, you know, eggshell satin kind of finish on my walls, I'd probably come up over here. And that's looking actually pretty good. One of the things that happens with this normal map is it tries to figure out based on the shadows where the high points and low points of this texture are. Then based on that, it says, okay, if the if if I was coming down with light from above, which is this little see a little green on on here, here's how those shadows would fall. Sometimes clicking this button is going to give me a big difference above or below uh how that material looks. This one doesn't really seem to be changing too much. There's a little bit of a flicker as I flip back and forth, but uh sometimes I'll see a significant amount there. Let's crank it up and see if we can get All right. So, if I switch that There we go. So, you can see how that jumps uh that normal is applied above or below. So, this is going to depend on your material. I'm not going to tell you to do one or the other, but again, use the slider to get the right amount of relief on there. If I go real bad, then I'm like, "Woo, super craggly intense. It almost looks like uh stucco on the exterior as opposed to drywall." If I come down totally smooth, then I'm back to basically having a picture on there. So, I'm going to want a little bit, but not a ton. So, maybe go like 20 5% like was that 1.6? That looks pretty good. And then, of course, we have ambient occlusion. It does make a map based on those high highlights and shadows. And I can intensify or mellow out that effect. And again, this is going to vary depending on what I'm doing. If I'm doing, you know, stone or something like that, I want to get those heavy dark places. Something like drywall, probably not as much. All right. So, there we go. So, I said this could be made better by having a more uniform color uh in the photo. I just took this with my camera phone. out in the hallway before making this video. So, uh it's surprisingly hard to get a, you know, several square feet of wall evenly lit. I took eight photos to get to this. So, uh granted, like I said, I wasn't really set up for success, but uh yeah, that's something to consider. Um in fact, let's talk about that a little bit more. Uh I took a couple pictures of carpet as well. I'm going to pull these up and just show you a couple images I took. So, here's the first one. Whoops. Sorry, I dropped it on the wrong screen. There we go. Here's the first image I took. And then I went back and I took a second image. And I just want to talk about these real quick. Um, what makes a good image. So, you can see this one on the right zoomed in a little bit more. This one's a little bit further out. Um, but you can see, you know, this is this is carpet in my house. So, this has been actively walked on. There's footprints. uh you know the threads of the the carpet are going different directions. So I have high lights, dark lights, that kind of thing. But you can see what what you should look at is the edges. So look at this edge versus this edge versus this edge versus this edge. So you can see that like right here on the left and the right are much lighter than what's up here at the top. And at the bottom we have a dark spot, but that's and it's it's actually a shadow of me. It's not a stain or anything. Don't don't stress. Um this is not great. This is not a good section of carpet to bring in to AI. If I was cutting a chunk out in the middle and that's all I needed, sure, this would work great. But if I want to tile this, this is not ideal. Over here, we're zoomed in a little more, which means we're going to get a little bit more detail in our carpet. And you can see the edges are not perfect. There's a lighter spot here, a little darker spot here, but it's overall pretty uniform. This is going to make this carpet 2 JPEG is going to make a much better import than this one over here. This one will work, but when it tiles, you're going to see that tiling much more. What I want to get is a fairly vanilla, fairly uniform look. Uh, enough mo movement and that kind of stuff. I can see that this is carpet, but not more than that. All right, I'm going to close those. And we'll go ahead and import that carpet, too, real quick. So, I'm going to go up here. I'm going say file, import again. Grab carpet 2. Import it. Same thing. I'm going to drop it down here. Scale it up. And then you can see. So, you can see again it's actually it's not perfect because you can see the lines here, here, here, here. But it's not bad, right? Like it's it's it's passable. The thing that's not passable about it is again the default values I got in here, my metalness and roughness lead this to look like it is a laminate picture of a carpet rather than actual carpet cuz the sun or the light is hitting it uniformly flatly across the whole surface. So again, I'll hit the little sprinkling of magic on button on here. Uh, and that's going to go through and tile it and a couple things. It's going to give it all of the different normals, the the ambient occlusion, and it's going to tile it. So again, it does scale it down. So when you take any tile pattern and shrink it down, you can start to see the repeats. That's just the way it works. So again, first thing I do is go to texture, position this, and maybe scale that up because that was a little bit tight. And uh yeah, see that looks better. And when you scale it up like that, too, it looks less repetitious. and than what I had before. But there we go. And look at So look at how this is is is hitting. So I got that normal map. As you can see, the normal map is giving me highs and lows, giving me these squiggles here. Uh which is cool. But it's so shiny. It doesn't It looks like I don't even know what this is. Like somebody polished an orange or something. But uh yeah. So one of the things I would do here, of course, is bring my roughness way up. I don't want any really almost any shine on carpet. a little bit. Yes, because there are plastic fibers in there. They're going to reflect back a little bit, but uh not a ton. And then I probably bring up my normal a little bit because these are actual pieces of material standing up. So, I don't want them uh, you know, glossed over or anything like that. Uh, ambient occlusion again is going to make a lot more dark in there as we go up because there's so many nooks and crannies in here for potential ambient shadows to be created. So, I'm going to go kind of light on that because I don't want it to be super dark like that. Uh, but I'm going to keep it a little bit lighter. Um, and there we go. And there we go. Got some You can see I'm not I don't have the same reflection now. It's not actually shining on there. And you can see that that plays with the light still, but it doesn't reflect it directly back. So, there we go. Quick and easy. a couple of photos turned into PBR materials in just a few seconds thanks to AI. So, this is just a couple examples. Um, people ask a lot of times, well, what about this kind of material? What about this kind of material? What if I want to bring in bare metal? What if I want to bring in suede? What if I want to bring in grass? Um, my answer to that question is, go do it. Try it out. You're not you're it doesn't cost you anything to hit the AI button. Uh you can experiment. Take several pictures. That would be my number one advice is like you're going to go out and take a picture of your lawn and bring it in here. Go snap like five pictures. Pull them up. Look at them. Look at the tops and bottom. Look at the edges. Uh do they do are they about the same color? That sort of thing. And then go ahead and throw it in there and then start messing with the sliders. Worst case, you spend a couple minutes and don't get a good material. you're in the same spot you were in before. Best case, you spend those couple of minutes and have a material you want to use over and over again. So, that's pretty sweet. If you like that video, click like down below.
