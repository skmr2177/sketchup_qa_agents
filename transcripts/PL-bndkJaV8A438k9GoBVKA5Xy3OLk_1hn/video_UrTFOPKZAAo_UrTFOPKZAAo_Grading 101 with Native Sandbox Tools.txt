hey everybody Eric here and today we're going to do a little grading refresher by taking a deeper look at sketchup's Native sandbox tools so if you're new to grading and terrain it might be a little bit intimidating at first because it's uh it's a little bit more at least complicated to think about maybe not so much to work with than it is to do things like objects rectangles triangles squares sort of basic geometry shapes but sketchup's got some really great tools called The Sandbox tools that if you're not familiar with this is going to be really helpful for you and even if you are it's probably not a bad idea to brush up just to remind yourself what they are and how powerful they are without the use of going to extensions so let's get to it so I've got a few exercises set up here the first thing I want to do is start from scratch now I'm going to need to load my toolbar so if you don't already have or if you don't work with sandbox tools a lot you can go find it under view tool pallets um by default it's not going to load and then sandbox so it's kind of an independent tool set so in this case I'm going to pretend like we don't have any terrain to work with so we've got just a blank surface but we want something maybe it's a concept terrain maybe you want to do a skate park or you want to do some landscape Mounds or something like that so what we want to do is start with actually creating if if you hover over this second icon down it's called from scratch and from scratch lets you create a grid that you can use to then sculpt so down in the bottom right corner you'll see that it says grid spacing 10 ft so if I kind of started a grid like this you can see that that's a little bit it doesn't fit the area that I want to grade because it's uh I'm working in a module of five so what I'll do is I'll just hit escape and when it says grid spacing 10 ft I want a little bit of a tighter grid so I'm going to press 5T so I can actually set this grid spacing here before I set the grid so you want to kind of think about how much detail maybe you want to work with so I'm going to click down and you can see there's my terrain Grid or my mesh grid that I'm going to work with now if I turn my hidden geometry on you can see it's not just the squares but they're actually triangles with hidden um middle middle lines so from here what I can do is we can go over to What's called the next one down so underneath from scratch is the smooth tool we want to be actually either in the mesh or we want to explode the mesh for this because we need the raw geometry to be able to work with so I'm going to come over here to smooth and then you can see what it's asking me for is for a radius in the corner so if I type in something like 30t you can see that the circle changes and if I type in something like 25 ft it changes again so what this is asking me to do it's saying find an area within this Terrain click down and hold and pull up and you can see that there's this offset distance so this offset distance that's just telling you how high you're pulling it up so in this case I'm pulling it up to 6 feet and I'm just kind of manually doing this this isn't meant to be super precise you just click and Pull and then click and Pull and you're sculpting these mounts if you wanted a little bit more control over what you're sculpting you can pre-select an area first and then use this move tool and then come over here and what you can see what's happening here is that it's selecting it's making sure to start with this selection and then it's grabbing everything around the outside of that so it's kind of a little bit different way to do it if I wanted to just select a different area show you that one more time you can see that what I'm doing is I'm starting with this pre-selected area and then now when I lift that I'm lifting it up from around that zone so just kind of a couple different ways you can work work with the smooth tool from scratch so on that note if you wanted to work with a little bit more detail you can see that it's maybe not it's kind of like a low poly terrain if you felt like you wanted to sculpt in a little bit more detail to a particular area maybe where you want to put a house or a path you could always come over here where it says add detail and if I click on ADD detail and then you know for example I'm going to smooth but maybe a smaller area so I'll drop this down to 10 foot for my radius and I wanted to kind of do some like precise sculpting so the more detail you have in your um subdivisions or in your terrain the more you can kind of have a smoother looking terrain or a little bit more control so just kind of think about that maybe before you get started and again if you're new to sbox play around with it so you can see the difference lastly when you're all done you can just take the whole thing and if you want to some soften the edges or the c-l planer so that way you get what is just a smooth mesh and in order to see that a little bit better I'm just GNA give that a color and that one's done that's that first one is from scratch and smooth let's keep going so another way to work with sandbox tools is what's called from Contours so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select everything and because we have Contours already I don't need to have a grid I'm going to bypass that and go straight up to where it says from Contours so I'm going to click from Contours and there it is you can't see it because of the color but I'm going to go ahe and give that a color cuz my background's white and you can see there it is it made a mesh I'm going to move that so you can see that the it's following the exact same shape of those Contours if you get this extra little bit at the bottom there's a couple different ways to deal with that if you turn your hidden geometry on view hidden geometry you can come over here and delete those just kind of erase them like that it can get a little messy depending on how complicated your edges and terrain are personally I like to if I don't care about merging the Contours and the mesh you can just explode this and then that'll allow you to delete this in one go or what I can do is just take this bottom Contour here copy it go into the train mesh I'm going to edit paste it in place and what it's going to do is it's going to break that bottom Edge so that I can double click it and then I'm going to make this a group and delete it so there's that that's from Contours super easy if you've got Contours just use that you've got a mesh from here we're going to do from edges I'm going to delete that because that's our finished product so from edges what this means is that I have edges to start with I have edges that I want to then fill a Terrain in between them so I don't actually have the Contours I don't know what the slope is I just know what the bounding box is this is a sidewalk you can see the sidewalk kind of go ramps down and this is like a retaining wall for example so it' be like maybe planting in between a um at a park or you know in an office building or something like that so what I can do is I can grab edges from the geometry the existing geometry in my model so in this case I can grab this Edge I can hold shift grab this Edge hold shift and grab that edge so that's three edges one for the top of the walk one for the curved walk and one for the flat bottom of the slope walk so I'm going to pop out of that group and I'm going to come over here and paste it in place so now if I HIIT this just for example you can see I've got this edge here and that's going to be the inside part of my slope so now I can either draw a straight line if I wanted just to have a straight slope down or I can get a little Fancy with it and take something like the arc tool and then use the wall use this retaining wall as a reference so I'm drawing straight up or straight down depending whether I want a bio will or if I want to Mound and then what I could do is come over here and depending on how I want this I could either make that tangent or whatnot so maybe that's a little high for this area but I'm going to go for it I'm going to Triple click to select all of that area all of that bounding box and click from Contours so even though I don't have the inner Contours I have the outer Contours click from Contours and there it is again what I'm doing is I'm going to right click hit explode and again I'm going to do that double click group delete method I'm going to turn my sidewalk back on so we can see it and just to make it a little bit easier to see let's go ahead and give this a color and you can see actually there's the slope it's kind of like a mound that comes up and there it is so that's pretty cool so again now I'm just taking geometry or drawing geometry using it as a reference and then I'm using from Contours to fill in the gaps so let's look at two more tools just to make sure that we round out our sandbox tool set the next one is stamp so what stamp does is it basically asks you a question it says I'm going to do some grading so I want to stamp an object onto a Terrain so basically like this house I want to put this house down onto this slope but what I'm going to need is some of this terrain is going to need to get cut out and some of this terrain is going to need to get filled so you can see it's sitting inside the slope here so it what stamp does is it kind of tries to guesstimate at the difference of what is cut and what is fill and it creates a flat area for you to set your house or your road or whatever it is that you're building onto I'll give you an example so I'm going to come over here I'm going to find the one that says stamp so it's the the fourth one down and I'm going to select my house CU I'm going to stamp my house onto the terrain and I'm going to click stamp and it's going to ask me for an offset so the offset is that little red preview and it's saying like how far do you want to stamp outside of your building footprint so if I said one foot like I just wanted this little flat space and then that's it you know as a transition I could do that or if I wanted 10 ft like I wanted a big flat area in this case I'm just going to put something like 4 foot so I have like a walkway or I have like a landing that you can step out onto and then I want to um click my terrain and what it's doing is it's asking me whether I want to go up in which case I'm going to fill inside that slope or whether I want to go down in which case I'm going to cut into the hill so usually want to kind of balance it out a little bit you kind of want to balance your cut and fill so maybe I want to come up a little bit you know so that it's nice and flat there but not too much CU then I have to fill all that in so really just depends on what your needs are in this case I'm going to go with that and I'm going to drop that building straight down and you can see that's that 4ot offset so what I meant was is that it kind of creates that's the grade that's the slope or the transition between um where the grading stop stops and starts and then where it touches the building footprint or foundation so kind of cool little thing to know how to do quick way to do that so lastly assuming that I've got my house already placed and I've got it graded nicely and it looks like it's doing okay on the slope but then I might want to ask a questions how might I get there so for this I'm going to use the drape tool so this is where anytime you want to take 2D geometry and project the lines not an image but project the lines onto the slope this is what to use the drape tool so I'm going to click down on the terrain and you can see what it did is it projected the lines straight from the flat 2D path onto the 3D terrain now the only challenge with drape tools sometimes if you have really complex terrain or you have a really complex detailed shape it sometimes will miss um a connection point or there might be a break or a gap that it doesn't automatically uh seal or close up in which case you can see that the surfaces are not separate so I want to give this pathway going up my slope a different color but I can't do that so what I would recommend instead sometimes is to extrude your 2D Line work so I'm using the push pull tool just to extrude this and then again if you need to bring it down into the slope if it's not already I'm going to copy that I'm going to copy this pathway go into my slope group you don't always have to do this but I'm going to go ahead and do this just to be safe paste in place and the reason why is I can select my slope hold shift and select the pathway and say intersect face faces with selection so if you don't put it inside the group you have to do it with model and that's okay but it might means it's going to intersect with something you don't want it to so I'm going to say intersect with selection and then let's just say I didn't really need this it was just temporary geometry so I delete that and there's my path again but this time I can it I can see that it's separated from the slope so I can give it a different color so even if I was doing it from an angle yes maybe it doesn't work when I'm down at the grade because I actually have to regrade this and I haven't done that yet but you know if I'm looking at it an aerial or something like that that actually is useful to have that geometry projected onto the terrain so that's pretty much it I'm going to pull back here and just show you all that we kind of accomplished in such a a short amount of time which is we started from scratch from Contours from edges stamped draped and lastly intersected with the model so if it's been a while since you've tried uh sandbox tools or if you're brand new to sketch up and you haven't even attempted to do any grading or terrain I would say give it a go now you know all the basic tools that come with the sandbox tools which comes default with SketchUp so it's considered a native tool even though you have to load the pallet separately so let me know what you think what's your experience like grading uh do you kind of avoid grading have you never done it do you have somebody else do your grading for you let me know and we'll keep that conversation going in the comments box and I'll also o End by saying really quick that if you want some more grading tips you can see over behind this shoulder here is our landscape and site design course here on SketchUp campus so we've got basically all those tips that you just saw with a lot more and we even go into extensions and things like that so if you start here with us in YouTube play around with sandbox tools and when you're ready to take that next step we'll see you over at SketchUp campus so don't forget to share comment like subscribe let us know what you think and I'll say thank you see you next time
