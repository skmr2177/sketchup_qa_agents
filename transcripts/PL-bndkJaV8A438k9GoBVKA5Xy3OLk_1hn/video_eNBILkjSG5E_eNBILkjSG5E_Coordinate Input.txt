hey guys I'm Aaron and today I want to talk about coordinate input in SketchUp so with coordinate input what I'm talking about is going to an XYZ coordinate specifically from from a location to that location so rather than saying you know move my mouse in this direction this far uh actually typing in the exact coordinate of the point you want to get to SketchUp actually does this automatically it's not something we know a whole lot because the intended workflow is to use your mouse to set a direction and then type in the dimension um that's most of the work we do so you draw a line click one point move to where you want the second Point type in the exact Dimension and it'll adjust that same with rectangles same idea but it does have the ability to work with coordinates so if you're in a spot where you got to jump to an absolute coordinate or something like that we can do that let's look at how to do it right now all right so uh one thing to note is when we start talking about coordinates that the origin right this right here where all my lines come together this is zero zero zero zero to these more specific um so if if I go in and start defining an absolute point it is relative to zero zero zero being right here so let's talk about that let's talk about uh absolute coordinates I'm going to go ahead and just grab a line and I'm going to start from zero zero zero and let's say I want to go to the point that is over two feet of the green X is two feet and then vertical two feet so somewhere right up here in 3D space if I want to get there what I would do normally with edges is I'd move my my cursor along the red axis here type in 24 enter that'll give me that first Edge I come up to Green axis 24 enter and then go up to Blue 24 enter that point the top of this line now is two foot up over and above the origin so I draw a line there that line now goes from the origin to 24 24. now that's not I mean that wasn't painful I did that I was even talking that whole time and it went pretty quick but let's see how we could use absolute Point input to get to that same spot I'm gonna start the origin and I'm going to type square bracket if you look down at my measurements box on the lower right corner it now says length and I have two square brackets here I'll just type both square brackets in just hitting open square bracket we'll put both of those in there and now when I start to type a number it'll show up inside that bracket so if I put 24 comma 24 comma 24 and hit enter it's jumping that same point right there next to this this handsome fellow's leg this is absolute coordinate input and it does have to do with positive negative coordinates so if I come in here and I type in square bracket minus 24 comma 24 comma 24 enter it'll go negative on the red axis up the green axis 24 and then up the blue axis 24. likewise we come over here square bracket minus 24 comma minus 24 comma 24. I'm just leaving this all in the positive blue so I'm ending with a positive 24 that'll come up here and then of course one more start right here square bracket 24 comma minus 24 comma 24. that'll get us uh positive on red negative on green and then up the blue axis so that's what that does so that's two foot in each of the positive blue quadrants now again this is absolute so I'm going to go ahead and erase this fell right here and I'm going to grab a point kind of just arbitrarily right here now if I did that same input I'm going to hit square bracket 24 comma 24 comma 24 when I hit enter it jumps right back to here because again these are absolute points these are locations from zero zero zero so it doesn't matter where I'm at if I type square bracket 24.424 it's going to draw my Edge back to here now if I was to start right here and I wanted to go relative to this so I want I want to go this way 24 up the green axis 24 of the blue axis 24 . I want to get to that point from the end of this point right here I can do that by typing an angle bracket there's a little uh parity shaped ones a little little triangular guys down by the m key I'm going to hit that then I can type 24 comma 24 comma 24 and when I hit enter it's going to draw an edge 24 24 relative to the start point so that's how I could get to there so again if I come right here again it's another arbitrary point I hit angle bracket 24 comma 24 comma 24 enter it's parallel to this because it's moving the same distance relatively from this start Point as I did from this start point and that's that holds true for for any of these points so if I come over here again angle bracket minus 24 comma 24 comma 24. that one's going to be parallel to this because it's moving over to up to Vertical two just like that line was but it's going relative from this starting point which was apparently somewhere down below one of the dangers of uh of uh not working with points I suppose I just kind of clicked the spot well below the origin but you can see despite that doesn't really matter it still went up over and vertical to to foot and gave me a line that was parallel to this one right here which we know did that same same kind of movement so I know this was kind of short and simple but it's really kind of a short and simple process if you want to move absolute that is from zero zero zero to a point when you go into when you go to Define your length just hit that square bracket type in your XYZ coordinates if you want to go relative so starting at whatever point you have chose go to another Point angle brackets little carrot brackets and then put in your values there it's simple it's pretty easy it's not I mean it's not a tool where you're going to go in if you have to put in a hundred different points or something like that you can absolutely do that it's just not going to be very much fun be totally honest with you but uh it's there so if you ever need that if you need to jump to that point something like that you can do it it is pretty quick and easy to do if you like that video click like down below if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly they'll leave us a comment down below if you used compo or coordinate input I got the end of the video I forgot what it was called I just said quote it too many times used it all up couldn't say it again if you use coordinate input yourself and how has that gone for you you have an idea that would you think would make another good video if so let us know down in the comments we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
