hey guys it's Aaron and today I want to talk about component modeling or modeling with components and how using components properly can mean you do half or maybe even one quarter of the work so this is not a New Concept this is something we talk about regularly but it Bears repeating because we see questions on this fairly regularly um sometimes I'm GNA I'm going to say some crazy stuff right now but some people don't understand why to even use groups and don't know the difference in groups or components can you believe that so I wanted to just make a quick video to show the advantages of using components and copies of components when you're modeling a single thing so this gets away a little bit from like like if there's a repeating element in your model right if there's there's the same thing as in your model a dozen different times and you model this component once that way if you change the first one they all change that's still a thing that's valid but what I want to look at here is modeling a single thing but only modeling a portion of it and having it repeat all right so in here brand new clean model so what I want I just want to model a quick and and simple table so how I would probably go about this if I wasn't thinking about it I'd come in here I'd model the tabletop I'd give it some depth um this is ugly table uh but that's okay I'm going to move it up however far it's supposed to be up and then maybe I come in here and I'll do something like uh you know draw some legs and then we'll bring that down and then maybe grab all that and you know copy it over to here and then take those and copy it over to here something along those lines I would do those would be the General steps now I cut some Corners right I didn't use exact measurements when I moved the legs around I didn't componentize or group anything it's all raw geometry so there's some dumb stuff there but the dumbest part of what I did was if you look at this if I if I chop this table in half right down the middle it's the same on either side so let's talk about how we could make that with components so I'm going to start by drawing half the table and then uh you I'll come in here and I will give it you know actually before I give it depth let's let's say I want to round off the corners okay so that might be so I'm going to draw an arc from here to here double click and then I'm going to come up double click right here that gives me rounded corners and I'm going to take that push pull it to give it a little bit of depth and now at this point I'm going to grab it and make it a component and I will call it half table now now my half table exists so what do I need to do now well I need to put legs on it right so I'm going to go ahead and lift it up here and I got to get my legs on under here but before I do that I'm going to take it and I'm going to make a copy I'm going to put my copy right over here and this way uh when I make the legs on here they'll show up over here too now obviously first things first it was really obvious when I copied it over here that I copied it in the wrong spot right because my curves on here but if I had done the same thing with a rectangle i' taken that rectangle and copied it over here I would have been able to necessarily tell the difference right if I come straight over the two halves look the same so an important thing to note when you're modeling like this is how you get this other piece over here so I could take this now I could scale it I could rotate it I could figure out a different way to do it but I want to tell you the easiest way is using the flip command so if I grab this I say flip I hit my modifier key down here at the bottom it's going to tell you modifi modifier to make a copy I'm going to copy right over to its face now what that did was it inverted the whole thing so that means when I come in here and I go okay I'm going to come in here and I'll make round legs here I'll inference this circle right here there we go I'm going do that and then pull that down to to the base here like that see how both sides got them on the same spot again I'm making I'm I'm working smarter not harder I'm going to copy that over here and soon as I do that as soon as I copy this leg over it's going to show up here my four legs are done at that point quick and easy now this is a great way uh people call this out fairly regularly to me while I'm modeling people point out oh you when you uh uh model that building your model modeling both halves of it and a lot of it's the same that's absolutely true and uh this is what I should be doing split something at symmetric down the middle model both halves even if they're not perfectly symmetrical right maybe there's some features on this table that are only on one side maybe there's a keyboard tray I don't know I'm making up stuff probably not on a table like this this looks like a play table for a kid but if 90% of of something is symmetrical go ahead make your component make your changes and then you know halfway in make this unique and then make those other changes that don't have to be the same with something like a table even a rectangular table uh I could go a little bit further with it right so I could come in here I could make my corner of a table give that a little bit of depth and then I'll grab that make that into a component I'm going call this a quarter table and I'll do the same thing I will select it I will say mirror that hit my modifier key to make a copy mirror this over here then select both of them and then mirror again again modifier key to make a copy bring that over to the edge there and now I have four pieces of my table now if I come over here let's go under here let's add go into one copy right just one of them and then I'm going to put in my leg like even less work than what I did over here I only to make one leg and again I'm making this super simple you guys but I could put as much detail as I want in here it would all be the same uh and it would only have to be done once now here's the thing I got a big X in my table that's not ideal right I'm looking at my table I don't I don't want to have that that's simple enough I'm going to double click on this one and here's a thing that I run into a lot is when I'm editing this one piece it's hard to necessarily to see everything because all the other copies are here so if I go over to view and I go to component edit and I hide similar components not rest of model rest of model is going to get rid of all those other tables right so if I go to component and say hide similar components it hides just everything but the one I'm working on now let's clean this up so it works good as a component I'm going to go ahead and erase this line right here erasing that line just erases these edges I don't need those they'll always be covered up and then I'm going to use the hide modifier with the erase so if I come down here shift is going to toggle hide shift going to drag it across both these edges both these edges now when I click to come out of here I have what looks like oops I missed one I missed two do that again shift get rid of that little one and then over here we going to have one more get rid of him too all right there we go now we have what looks like one solid piece and again because it's still a component I could Comm in I could do something like um I don't know maybe I want to grab this and slide it over this way because I'm making it some cool looking table thing I can make that change once and because it's a component it's going to go ahead and do that on all four sides now there's downsides to this of course right so if I'm trying to make this a solid because I want to send a miniat version of my 3D printer these four pieces will have to get Consolidated into one piece if I'm trying to come up with a cut list how big is this piece well this isn't a piece it's four separate pieces so there's going to be a point at which you might want to go grab all of this and then we'll just make a copy of it over here here's how it would go about that with all four pieces selected right click make group now go into that group select my four uh component copies and explode with that now this is one piece and I could come in I could do some I could do some additional cleanup right because I did I did break that so I could say show me my hidden geometry get rid of that geometry all together tie that all together I could do a select get rid of my little line there around this side little line there there we go and with that now it's one piece so if I did want to make this a solid to print it I could if I wanted to check you know what is the length of this piece of material it is one piece now so I could in theory get a cut list with a with an extension or something like that but with that uh I did model that table one quarter of the work and again it's simple but if I had fancy legs and you know uh some follow me skirt or something like that around the outside uh it would all be able to be done one quarter of the work to get the same final table at the end so this is some of the true power of components like I said there is other things if I'm doing a you know a model of an exterior and I have a traffic cone and I put a bunch of traffic cones on there I can make them components that way if I want to change the color height size whatever I just have to do it once so that is definitely a powerful piece of components but people don't always think about using them to model a single thing so if you ever have repeating geometry look at your model beforehand and Save some time by modeling it fewer times and using components to duplicate uh yeah that's what we got today if you like that if you learned anything or if you just enjoyed the video go ahead and click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week around here and to be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment down below let me know what you think of this process do you use this do use something like this did I miss something or can you think of something else you think would make a good video on our Channel we like making these videos a lot like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank [Music] you
