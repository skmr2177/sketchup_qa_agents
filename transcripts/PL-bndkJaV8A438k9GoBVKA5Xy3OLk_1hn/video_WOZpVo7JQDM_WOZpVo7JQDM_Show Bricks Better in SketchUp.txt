hey everybody Eric here and today I'm going to share with you three different ways to work with bricks in SketchUp so when I say work with bricks in SketchUp what I mean is showing bricks on a facade so brick wall brick cladding whatever even brick paving if you wanted to put it on the floor and there's a few different ways to go about it especially considering that bricks I would imagine you would have a lot of them so first of all would you want to model each brick maybe maybe not or would you want to go with the texture let's compare a few different ways now what I want to do is first think about this wall and I want to I'm going to just make this a brick wall we're just going to pretend like this is maybe a building so bear with me here first thing we want to do is think about well do I need to draw the bricks do I need to come in here and figure out what a brick size is and actually draw them on the wall or could I kind of shortcut the process and as we know those of you that have already explored the default material library or even found images and textures online one place to start is right here we've got a section in the uh in our materials editor or materials browser for bricks cladding and siding so I'm just going to apply the bricks just like that now the nice thing about using the materials in the library is that they're already scaled so if I was to kind of check the measurements of one it would be uh the scaled to the size of the brick wall so that kind of saves a little bit of time so let's kind of go with this gray one here and say that's my first option super quick now the challenge or the limitation of just going with whether it's a default library or whether that's one you find online is going to be that you're going to be kind of showing the materials and you may especially earlier in the process may not want to show color yet or you may want to render it in black and white for some reason and add your own color if you go to if you go to monochrome mode though of course the texture is just an image so it disappears now another way to do that which is to sort of leave the brick Line work but maybe show it uh in monochrome mode or not worry about the color which may not be the color that I want would be to come over here back to the materials editor and instead of looking for a brick texture come over here to patterns So within the patterns you can see some of these are kind of diagrammatic or construction maybe document oriented but you can test out a few different ones like for example I think this one here so I might try a few different ones see depending on whether I want you know I want to alternate the coursing um or if I want to just kind of stick with something traditional like this sort of running bond so let's go with that for right now because that sort of matches the scale and the look of the brick that I've got over here now the same same thing applies with the monochromatic brick pattern or Texture is that if you turn if you go to monochrome mode or you go to shaded with texture mode you're going to lose the pattern of the brick because there's no geometry it's just an image but the nice thing about it is that if you have your shaded with textures on you've got sort of this black and white brick texture and that's kind of cool because if you're early in the process and you want to apply Color later using Photoshop or hand coloring um that's kind of nice maybe we haven't picked out which brick that is we want the brick to show so lastly what we're going to do is we're going to look at drawing some Line work so let's put our materials tab away and let's draw some bricks for this I'm going to zoom in just maybe zoom in a little bit here and I'm going to start by making a rectangle I'm going to create a modular brick and I need to think about in this case the not just the brick itself but the grout in between the bricks and so that's called nominal size which means that it's the taking into account the dimensions of both the brick and the grout in this case what I'm going to do is type in 24 in by 8 in and so if you're going with kind of a typical standard modular brick this is kind of a good number to go with which is a nice round number that you can remember 8 by 24 so let's go ahead and use the I'm going to select use the move tool plus the modifier which is the control option and then I'm going to drag a line down and I'm going to hit backspace and three to basically divide that by three I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to copy this using the move modifier I'm going to copy this side over this time I'm going to divide this by four and what I'm getting is sort of a grid of bricks that sort of fits this 24 by uh 8 in dimension I don't need all of these in fact I only need one brick um I just kind of was using that Dimension so I didn't have to do the math and I'm also going to make this brick a component you can't see it because of the Z fighting so I'm drawing on a Surface but if I double click the whole thing I can make this a component and I'm just going to call this brick I've already got one in there so I'm just going to call this brick two and then there we go now this was the nominal size of the brick so basically that means with the grout so depending on your grout size typically 38 inch here if you're using imperial units which means I'm just going to take that off or 28 in so I'm going to go so what would that be if I'm doing my math I'm going to go 1 18 in and then that's going to count for the grouting now remember it's going to double because you're going to put two bricks next to each other you're going to put one on top so think about that thickness of the grout that you need so let's copy that don't need those that was just so that I knew that the brick was sized properly and I didn't have to worry about weird Dimensions where we get into fractions of an inch so now I'm going to lay this out on my wall depending on where you want to line it up you can line it up where the brick ends or the grout ends in this case I want the brick to be the edge of the wall so I'm going to kind of ignore that grout line and then I'm just going to copy this from the grout Edge all the way over and I don't remember how many I need so I'm just going to say time 18 that's too manytimes 17 and that gets me right where I need to be of course maybe it won't be so clean for you you may have to cut bricks but in this case I sized it so that I had an even number of bricks so this is where it gets interesting as well we can then decide whether we want to copy one up in this case I'm copying it by the midpoint and then we're going to copy that again and then times I think 16 in this case now the problem here is we have if you're going to cut the brick then you're going to need a secondary brick module so one for the main brick and one for a half a brick I may want to come in here and just hide the edges of the grout and for the reason for that is because I actually don't really want to see the grout but I would maybe turn my hidden geometry on so view hidden geometry and then there's my grout I can still use that to sort of line things up I just turn my hidden geometry on and that's nice so here's a keyboard shortcut I can see my grout lines for spacing but in this case I can just turn them off now I've got this one here I could just cheat it if I was in a hurry and I could scale it but of course it's going to change a little bit the grout dimens ions you can see it's shrunk that grout so to do this proper you would want to make this unique and you would want to make sure to turn your hidden geometry on and pull this one over there just like that so now we've got kind of a half brick module we've got a full brick module and we can just place that in place and slide it in using the hidden geometry as a guide now once you've done two rows in this case if you're doing a running bond you could just do two rows and make that a component so I'm just going to kind of call this a row or whatever and then copy this up as many times as I need to fill out my wall so let's see how many times do I need times 12 nope Time 13 nope and times 14 there we go I've rounded out my wall so the nice thing about this here is that if I go into monochrome mode for any reason just because I want to get rid of the other colors and textures in my model I can see that my bricks still show which is nice now of course I'm adding a little bit geometry um but it's really not too bad depending on the size of your model now these aren't 3D these are 2D so you're really only adding um maybe eight lines per brick so just something to think about now if you go to render though for example if I was going to go into vray for and wanted to render this you can see that the textures are better than the lines because the textures will show even if there's no geometry even if I'm in Hidden monochrome mode and I can't see it in my SketchUp model but here I can't see the bricks at all because the lines don't show the edges don't show when you render this is the advantage of using a component as a Breck so if we pull this one out for example I'll pull this out that same 1 18 inch and then I'll do that one more time in fact you can see this here before we even render you can see this in SketchUp by turning the edges off and you've got the Shadows on you can see here that the brick is actually starting to show if I change the shadow pattern it will represent it will represent there so that's kind of cool so let's render that one more time and just see the difference you can see that if I kind of zoom in here you're getting those highlights and you're getting the shadows and then if I change the time of day you're going to get the light will respond on the actual brick now if you're worried about the size of it you could combine these methods for example I'm worried about you know if I have too much geometry in my model if I have bricks covering a very large surface area it might be adding detail that I don't really need so that's something to think about let's just go ahead and show you how to combine methods you could always go back to using the texture in what's called a working mode and then assign the bricks for example I'm going to copy the 3 bricks on top of the texture and I could go ahead and put those on a bricks a 3D bricks tag so then when I'm working I could show just a texture spin around the model things are really light performance is great and then when I'm ready to render or I'm ready to kick off a final view I click on render and you can see I've got the 3D bricks there so if I switched the to monochrome mode um you can see I'm in my 3D my full 3d bricks so working mode just texture render mode got my bricks so really just depends on how you want to organize your model how many bricks you want to show and what type of brick how much control you want over the actual Arrangement and the design and the layout of the bricks themselves so that's it it's bricks three ways so the idea of using the color textures over here the monochromatic textures or patterns which you'll find it um in the same default library or going in and just making your own brick very quickly using a component and then arraying that component as a module so whichever method you choose the point here is make sure you use the one that's working for you make sure you use the method that's going to show your design off the best and make sure that you remember that you have complete control over not only what you want to show but when and how you want to show it so don't let something like adding a bunch of bricks to your model even worry you uh when you do it like this you set it up with some tags apply it to a scene uh things are going to going to run smooth and efficiently your model is going to look great so I'm going to leave you there I'm going to say as always thanks for watching don't forget to give us that like share comment let me know do you work with bricks do you just do them in details do you uh model the whole thing just use Line work I'd be curious to see not just how I do it but how you do it let me know in the comments below and with that thanks see you next [Music] time
