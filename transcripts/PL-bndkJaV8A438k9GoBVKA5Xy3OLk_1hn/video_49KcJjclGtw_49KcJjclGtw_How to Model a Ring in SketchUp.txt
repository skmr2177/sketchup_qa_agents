hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about how to model a ring so what am I talking about when I talk about Ring I'm talking about jewelry I'm talking about some just basic band type geometry we get a lot of questions requests to model specific things some of these things are enormous aircraft carriers uh um various planes vehicles trucks uh we appreciate it keep it coming um a lot of these things are big they be difficult like days of modeling weeks of modeling to actually get done so let's kind of fall off one end on the other hand we get some things which are fairly basic quick easy to see how they work uh models in those cases we do want to make videos of that so this is a question that's actually come up a couple times to show me how to model a ring um I don't know exactly that's that's the whole question that's the whole request so not details in there about you know is there fancy things so I figured we'd start with simple simple modeling we're going to go through and look how to model something like my wedding band uh we're going to actually do that right now all right so I'm not going to go through the process of you know on camera taking my band off my fingers and measuring this with calipers I did that off camera and I just have a couple of numbers here so the inside of my ring is 18 mm the outside of my ring is about 20 mm so it's about 2 mm wide and then I just got a little cross-section of the shape here it's about 7 mm tall and it kind of has this you know slopes like that and then it's almost a flat spot of about a millimeter on either end so it kind of kind of slopes up a little bit and then slopes so kind of a a d shape that we want to make so want to make all this so first things first I want to model this in the middle in the the values that are here so it's in millimeters I'm not going to actually model in millimeters several of you have mentioned this or mentioned this in videos before SketchUp was made to model architectural model so it really works best when we're working at like hous size objects we can go smaller of course but something real small we want to get a lot of detail in I'm going to want to go to uh model at a larger scale and then shrink down for output so what I'm going to do is I am going to go pull up my model info I'm going to go into my units and I want to model everything in meters so what I'm going to do is I'm going to one for one me everything so 18 millimet is going to be model as 18 M and then I can just take the final thing and scale it down so couple questions here learning aside this is going to be a nice learning process of figuring out how to create this exact geometry but why would I model something like this I'm I want to model this not like why would I model it but what's my purpose I want to model this in such a way that maybe I could build off this and create a cast for you know like a 3D printing model where I could take it maybe print it out of wax and then cast it in metal um something along those lines that's what I'm looking to do here I want to get enough detail that if I was to make this into a real thing in the real world it would work it would look nice and smooth I don't want to be heavy fasted so I'm going to be real high on my poly count but to get out a good looking ring model so let's do that so first thing I'm going to take my image and I'm just going to move it off to the side a little bit um I'm going to say goodbye to Teddy we don't need Teddy right now and the reason I'm doing that is anytime I work off of something circular if I can I like to work off the origin because when I look at this ring the center here the middle this is going to be negative space right so I don't have a point that I can use as reference like if I was modeling a square I like to grab a lower left corner and put that at the origin in the case of a circle if I can align it to the middle that's that's the easiest for me so when I grab come up here I'm going to grab my circle and I'm going go to the very middle and what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull it out um half of this inside Dimension so it's it says 18 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull it out uh 9 M um before I do that though well let's let's let's go ahead and do it I'm going to do it nine enter and there we go um I kind of lost my image there my picture where'd it go let's scoot that over even more let's just stick around here there's not there many dimensions on here but let's go pull it out again so nine enter and there we go that's 9 M so now you can tell if if I was to take this say I was to send this to 3D print or something like that I that this very faceted look right um it's possible on the outside maybe that's a cool look for the outside of my ring and I want that for the inside I probably want it nice and smooth so if I pull my entity info it's 24 edges right now so generally speaking I try to work in increments of 12 so a low poly Circle would be 12 something where I don't care was just for visualization 24 but if I'm outputting a circle that's going to be printed I usually jump to 48 or in this case I'm going to go to 96 sides and you can see that's a much smoother Circle if I zoom way in here I can still eventually see the facets but for my purposes shrunk down to you know less than 20 millim that's going to work just fine speaking of 20 millim um I could have set that first too when I come in circle initially before I type anything else I can just tell that I want 96 sides and I could draw it that was for illustrative P purposes I did that that way all right so if I look in here my exterior my width of the wall wall is 20 I'm not going to do that here so what this is what this piece right here is this is my path that I'm going to use for follow me to actually put the geometry in I'm going to just make this shape sitting on the outside of my my path so my overall height of the wall of my ring so this is just a cross-section like right through here is seven so what I'm going to do is I'm going to come right here I'm going to go up 3.5 the overall width of the wall is two so from here I'm just going to come over two come back down seven then I can actually use inferencing to just hold down shift and snap to there to there all right so if I was to trace this around if I used follow me and said trace a circle I'd have real basic ring shape that would work out awesome so in my ring this first uh one so half this this is this is two this is 1 millim to here 1 millimeter to here the second millimeter from here down to here is one great Arc so I'm going to do it's it's a great Arc I don't know why I said that that way but it is it's really something all right so I'm just going to come down there to Middle to middle and pull that out to the front there so again same thing here this Arc is six segments so the whole the whole thing was 12 I might bump that up maybe I'd say like that's 12 just give me a little bit more a little more smoothness this is going to create a lot of geometry but again the interest here is like I'm creating a hero prop this is a thing that is going to you know look awesome by itself this maybe something is going to get rendered or like I said output for 3D printing all right over here um I'm going to create another Arc I'm trying to figure out exactly how far down I want to put it uh this part is a little real small I couldn't pull a caliper on this thing so here's how do I'm going to come down 0 five and then from that point I'm going to draw another Arc from here straight across to where it intersects this previous Arc and then pull that up that wasn't quite right be a little higher to get tangent tangental so let's try going up .1 MIM and then I'll draw another Arc from that point this is that was not the right point one oh I said1 millimeter undo undo I I faked myself out there all right 0.1 enter there we go so now I'll draw from there where it meets there that's that is good enough I'm happy with that all right so then I'm going to take this shape right here I want to get that exact same shape on the the bottom so I'm going to grabb that little chunk just the chunk that's going to get cut off right here and I'm going to say mirror that my modifier key to copy grab blop trace it down here boom like that and then I'm going to erase these extra edges and that is a pretty good look profile for my ring all right last step here um just to make this easier I'm going to get rid of the surface cuz all I need is this ring I don't actually need the face in there uh I'm going to grab that I'm going to go to tools and say follow me and then just click this shape and there we go get rid of this on the inside that is a very good representation of what my ring looks like awesome last thing I'm going to Triple click so you can see how many faces in here like I said this is going to be nice and smooth when I 3D print it that's going to look look perfect that's going to look awesome this is too much if I was I mean if this was supposed to be I don't know the end of a turbine is what's coming to mind something like that it's a lot of geometry I wouldn't want to do this for a full-size model especially if this is repeating but for this being a hero prop makes a lot of sense so I'm going to go ahead and make it a component let's call my ring now I'm just going to take it make a copy over here there's the full height full size one I want to go from meters to millimeters so I'm going to go scale start dragging it down one corner to the opposite corner so it's a uniform rescaling and say 0.001 enter uh I want to lose that where'd it go oh it's tiny there we go zoom in zoom in zoom in there we go all right so with that I can right HCK if I hit scale definition that's going to set it so it's not a scaled version now that's the actual size that it is and this is this the file I would want to use to export this to 3D print because this is the proper size this is what I want to actually if I was to print this it should fit on my finger just like my current wedding ring does and that would be it so there we go quick and easy ring in SketchUp so yeah like I said that was that was a request and I know I went deep I went like step by step and explained a lot of stuff um realistically it's probably a few minutes to get that modeled pretty quick and quick and easy with all that detail um but hopefully those who asked show me how to model a ring that works for you if there's more specifics you had in there some spe you know I mean modeling jewelry can be a big deal I talked about an aircraft carrier taking a lot of time to a real fancy nice looking ring and that kind of thing that could that could take some energy and some time but uh if there's specifics you'd want to see in here let me know about that and if there's other things you think would be great to see modeled in you know whatever we have 10 15 minutes here let me know about that too down in the comments below if you haven't already do give us a like down below if you like that and please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe and like I said most importantly let us know in the comments what you think is there something else we should show is there something else a specific thing we should model tell us in the comments like Mak these videos a lot but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
