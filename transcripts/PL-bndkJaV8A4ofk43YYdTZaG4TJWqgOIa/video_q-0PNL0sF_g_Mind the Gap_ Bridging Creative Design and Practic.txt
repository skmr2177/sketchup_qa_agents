hey everyone I'm Mike Brightman my company's Brightman designs and I design homes in Denver Colorado using SketchUp Pro layout and my condoc tools extension I'm also the author of The SketchUp workflow for architecture arguably the best SketchUp workflow book ever written and I got John Brock with me here today John what do you think about that what's up Mike I have to concur so so I'm John Brock I'm a custom builder and designer uh SketchUp junkie like Mike uh SketchUp author uh SketchUp for Builders uh and have several SketchUp extensions that I developed over the years like estimator PDF importer framer new one called spot so anyways long friends with Mike and we're going to have some fun absolutely man yeah so we we teamed up to do this uh presentation for base camp 24 in uh Vegas and thought we'd take a run through it and show you guys what we got so let's get started so this is a project I worked on in Denver uh recently completed and uh massive renovation pop top renovation where we pull the roof off of an existing house so this is the house as it stood when I started the project and this is the Demolition and in Denver it is a precise science to your essentially your demolition plan manifests itself in real life you got to leave behind like 40% of the exterior walls in order to like grandfather in some of the benefits like an attached garage it's just as stringent when it comes to the construction side of things things so we had this massive concrete wall that was kind of the centerpiece of the whole thing and I was very concerned about the height of it because I can't imagine what it would take to you know peel 6 Ines of this thing off uh just to to meet the the zoning Cod so you got to be really uh informed on what you're building and I found that like I wasn't quite as informed as I'd like to be i' build my floor Heights you know 10-ft floor Heights and one foot for the flooor system but um I reached out to John Brock because I was concerned about meeting you know ducking under that bulk plane and so that's really where all this started is he really helped me uh you know dial in realistic Dimensions rather than my uh rough designer dimensions and this project was truly a success I mean it came out great so this is the final product and I thought we'd just take a quick peek inside uh before I dig in on all the technical stuff so uh this is uh right when you walk in the front door a living room and that you can see that concrete literally from like every room in here and pool in the backyard and uh this is our dining room and then up above we have this Loft hammock and that truly is the uh you know the the gem of the project when you're up there laying on the Loft hammock you can see like every space downstairs so in order to get here though we had to navigate Denver's zoning code uh this is is for the urban house form in the front 65% of the lot we can go up 30 ft and then on the sides we come up 17 ft and then slope in at 45° so uh the the front setback is what we call a block sensitive setback essentially we just have to line up with all the other houses on the street and then the side setbacks are going to be 5 ft now this is a lot to take in uh it's really just uh not very visual when you're highlighting these on the the code sheet so what I like to do is to draft this up and build these rules in SketchUp so that I can visually know that I'm ducking under that bulk plane so let's hop into SketchUp and take a look at that okay so inside a SketchUp the first thing that we'll do is take a look at uh this site you know I pulled all this in from placemaker uh all the topography the aerial imagery uh use placemaker to pull that in and uh really improves the clarity so you can actually see what's going on on the site uh so this outer uh outer context area this is not modeled at quite as much detail as this uh this area here this is my actual site with the lot lines draped on and then you can see that I modeled this you know very precisely based on our survey so let's get our survey in here I'm going to go to uh this next scene here this is is the uh level one existing finished floor height and that will be what we build off of uh since this is technically a renovation but let's get our survey in here I'm going to go to file import and you'll notice that I do have the ability to pull in PDF vector graphics what's that all about John PDF importer let you bring in ve Vector PDF so you can actually read all the text and all that kind of stuff instead of just being lines like you get in a cad file nice all right well then we're going to Dr this out like this I use this to on every project to bring in the survey for sure and then I also use it uh when I'm making like sketch plans in layout uh to get those into sketch up as well uh so this survey is at a scale of 1 inal 10 ft and so we're going to set that 1 inch equal 10 ft down here and that way when I import the PDF uh will come in at a real world scale you can thank Mike Brightman for that scale feature CU that's why we added it after much harassment yeah I mean it it's uh you know it's the little things there's nothing bigger you know to be able to skip the whole uh tape measure tool and scaling it and all that so uh definitely a nice Improvement man all right so let's do that so we get it kind of lined up and I'm just checking my property Corners here and that looks pretty good all right so where we're at now is we have our um our our level one existing finished floor we have our survey pulled in aligned at that you know at that elevation and so now what we need to do is start constructing our bulk plane so I'm going to hide this for just a moment and let's talk about the bulk plane so we were looking at this code sheet we're working with like the front 65% of the lot well a good way to get that without having to do a lot of math is to throw a guideline back here and then scale this uh this kind of lot these lot lines to 0 65 like that and then I could make a copy of this to the back like that and then use my scale tool like that all right so now we've like struck the back 65% now as far as the uh front setback we're going to need it's that block sensitive setback and we're not going to go through all that math it it's basically like line up with the other homes uh the front the what it the front facing the the furthest projecting face of the actual house not the porch uh so actually I think it is this line would probably be better but doesn't matter okay so now we're going to strike another guideline up by 30 ft like that and then I'm going to draw a rectangle like this we're going to hover on this hold shift and then snap to the end there all right then I'm going to paint this with a texture like that and we're going to use our Push Pull tool and slide this all the way to the back all right so now we've defined our 30t height and we've got our front setback our rear uh not setback but that's kind of the where we're allowed to build up to 30 ft in the back I'm going to make this into a group and then double click in and let's Now set another guideline at 17 ft up like that again I'm just pulling off of here so uh we go up 30 ft and then on the side interior uh lot lines we go up 17 ft and kick in at 45° so now we'll go with our uh protractor tool like this and we're going to lock it on the green and go 45 and then we're going to lock it on here 45 use our line tool and strike that and strike that then with our Push Pull tool I should be able just double click to get rid of those contr e clears my guides that's my shortcut uh contr e clears those guides and so now you know we're looking at uh we're close so the last thing we need to do is drill in here and do a 5 foot uh interior uh uh side interior lot line setback and then I'll use my line tool go up on the blue use those inferences like that I didn't miss I missed that one that's okay push pull double click double click contr e clear my guides there's the rules that we're allowed to build in but what we haven't done is defined the height which is super important so I'm going to open up another file here and this was like from the project that I was you know these are my notes for this project and so you can see that there's this little equation you got to run where it's like kind of the average of these two points which is 22.9 + 22.6 ID 2 is 22.75 the difference between the finished floor and where my Base plane starts is 22.75 so let's go 1.15 down so I'm going to move this straight down by 1.15 ft like that now we have our rules set in place and so you know I'll go back here with our uh with our survey on there and I'm going to double click in here and I'll just hide these two pieces for now so that we can kind of work in here and this is where I really brought in uh John for for his expertise is uh you know setting up these these like finished floor Heights and let me show you how I would have done it or how I did this project initially I'm going to draw a rectangle at like 6 by 10 ft and then you know as a a what what not I don't want to say a novice designer but just a lazy designer or uninformed designer I'd say like oh yeah you know we're going to go up say 9 fet and then it's going to be another uh you know 12 in for the floor system and then do 9 ft and then 12 in like this and then do another 9 ft like that all right and then you go look and you're like oh God now I got to come up another what 8 in and let me scoot this over so that you know we can really see it so it's like you know that was kind of how I approached this thing where you know on my first rip at it and setting up these uh finished floor Heights and so I'll just throw some uh another material on there as well like Bam Bam and paint this top piece so that we can see you know that's kind of like how I would have approached a project in the past and it wouldn't be a big deal you know like if you were just building a new house out in the country somewhere Within didn't care about uh building Heights and all that or not so much but in Denver man they are strict so what we're going to do now is I'm going to have John kind of talk me through how this wall would actually be constructed uh what you say John yeah know well first of all you got a bottom plate so your your bottom plate is going to be an inch and a half right yep so we'll do 1.5 yep you said it was 9ft walls right so next after that you've got studs for a 9ft pre-cut foot wall is actually 91 and E it's not 9 ft okay you're going to buy studs that are pre-cut to work out to be 91 and an e that's to allow for your ceiling and your finished floor to give you a 9ft finish ceiling so studs in a 9ft wall are actually 104 and 5/8 so 104 and 5 sl8 so 104 space 5 sl8 and then what's next Double top plate so another 1.5 another 1.5 I'll just double click again all right and that should yield you a 9' one8 if you want to measure yourself from top to bottom that should be your standard Wall height yeah so 9 foot one and an e rock and roll Perfect all right what are we doing about our floor system here so in that case you were I think your structural guy said 11 and 78 tji so 11.875 for 11 and 78 members there uh 11.75 like that no 875 11.875 o 11 8 7 5 enter like that yeah and then 3/4 floor sheet 3/4 3/4 subfloor yeah uh all right and then we'll just kind of paint those so we're seeing how that Stacks up all right now up to this wall we'll go another 1.5 right 104 and 58 oh no 1.5 yeah you're doing the bottom plate yes yep and then what's next 104 104 and 58 like that yeah and then we'll do 1.5 and and 1.5 correct and then ah shoot remind me again 11 and 11 11.875 is 11 and 78 you get used to the fractions yeah yeah 3/4 like that and then we can just stack these guys again and then I can probably get this one started 1.5 and then I forget what do we say like 8ft ceilings up top so 8T ceilings your studs are going to be 92 and 5/8 pre-cut all right well and you know let's stick I think I said 9et so let's do 104 and 58 and then and this is where yeah so and 1.5 yeah you're busted and then uh oh and what about our let's just build this out and then we'll make our adjustments uh decide which floor we want to pull this out of you were using lvls that were 9 and a half I think on top of that okay so 9.5 and then another y yeah like that all right and uh yep that all looks good all right it all looks good except we're we're busting through our bulk plane but at least now you know we're we're like super confident about where uh where we stand on this so uh probably you know I I know on this project we were okay with the the top floor coming down like say 12 in something like that and then I think we would probably pull this one down another 12 is that accurate yeah so a nine eight and an eight and that gets you under the that plank all right and then where does that put us like what is our overall Dimension here from or our our leftover wiggle room uh so we got like seven in all right and then I do remember on this project it's been two years uh well more than that since I was messing with these drawings but uh we had like a curb as well going around that and I just was it felt much safer to to give ourselves a little bit of breathing room and and really know that that that was the case so uh yeah so uh that is uh kind of the difference between just throwing in the designer uh finished floor Heights versus you know really dialing in exactly how this would be built uh but you know also like you know there there's nothing wrong right with like some weird Dimension like John what if I wanted to make this you know like uh 3 in higher like no big deal right but it just gives the guys in the field a lot more work is that true well you're going to have to pre you're going to be cutting studs one by one every stud have be cut if you go with a custom height cuz you can get 8T 9t and 10t pre-cuts typically most markets I think yeah now when you're on a concrete if you're on a concrete slab you you would have have to cut those studs anyways uh because it's rare that floor is going to be perfectly leveled so you'll end up having to cut a little bit off of each one potentially unless you're in a level straight so gotcha job cool okay uh the last part of this then would be to set our floor height so that's kind of what I was getting at is that you know we have all these plans pulled in and so now instead of just throwing them at you know these these kind of rough floor Heights we can set them at uh very precise floor Heights absolutely we like Precision you like Precision yeah me too especially on this project where you know just ducking under that bulk plane really had me nervous uh all the way up until we got that final approval uh so okay uh John I think I'm going to pass it over to you uh to take a lap through some slides and talk about some other some other uh issues in in line with this like this is just like one area where you know we can bridge this gap between the design and the construction and the reality so uh I'll I'll hand it over to you to walk through those slides well first of all it's a killer house man I'm very impressed thanks man seriously I would love I would as a builder I would love to build it and as a 3D guy I would love to model it so yeah nice man you did a killer job on that so all right well I'll go ahead and share my screen and um we'll pull up the presentation I'm going to give you a little bit of Builder Insight on um my take on a few things here so one of the things that kind of drives me crazy is Architects often use 4 in and 6 in lines for their or spaces for their interior walls instead of three and a half and 5 and A2 I I don't know why other than it's simpler to offset four and offset six and we do six for our exterior walls because that includes sheathing but you can imagine how it can lead to a lot of layout nightmares and mistakes like you can see the string of Dimensions that are running across uh through there a carpenter out in the field is going to be the one that's going okay I'm go half inch this way or half inch that way uh what if you had a a a prefab tub or shower say a 60in prefab tub well what if that space that is 60 in and it has to go in after framing what if it's 59 1/2 or 59 or 60 1/2 or 61 you know to me it just builds in errors that can happen and head scratching so that's kind of one of my little pet peeves um I'll throw Dwayne Addy under the bus he's helping me on this one particular job uh so I always tell him to think about the framers and think about Framing and I've told him forever I want 4 and 1 12 Ines then a rough opening for a door which is a door size like this 28 door plus 2 in is 210 and then another 4 and A2 okay that would give me 3 7 not 35 if I hadn't caught that the guys would have framed it they would have used two2 fours on one side two 2 fours on the other side and then they would have to rip a/ inch piece of plywood both sides to close that in now the purpose for the four and A2 you can do it with three and in a lot of cases but most of our projects we use wide casing or even a two-piece casing and I can't stand to see ripped casing it just drives me nuts so uh so he went back and corrected that uh but that's sort of my workflow of laying out things with Dimensions now this is a house that was an awesome house awesome designer 50 some pages of drawings he had every single thing detailed but he had some things in there that I didn't really agree with right so I'm looking at this is actually a snapshot from our virtual tour because I took his plans and built a full SketchUp model in a virtual tour and inscape okay with the picture of that background that you're seeing of the lake so I first said hey this door is kind of slammed up against the wall and I'm going to have to rip the casing he said oh know we that we do that that's fine not fine with me but I went along right and then you can see the window to the left and there was another stairwell on the other end of the house where there's a window being blocked by the stairs or right adjacent to it or behind it and so that leads some complications how do you get in there and paint how do you use this and you can see it from the outside right so I just remember the expression it was a signature feature and I just remember thinking you know beautiful house though I mean I love the designer I love the design and it came out beautiful but these are kind of little pet PE same house we go upstairs on the upper level where we have a slope ceiling and I'm going uh the casing is going to have to be you know a cut right in there you know and it's going to look like crap and I said let me show you and I did the virtual tour oh that's fine and I was like yeah it's okay with you but it's not with me because what if one of my other customer comes through another person a prospective customer comes in and goes wow you know or somebody visiting the house and goes well who built your house you know I think it's a reflection on the Builder so it's kind of that let's have some some uh some discussions on some of these things from design standpoint um here's another Dwayne addan love him to death but he puts all these brackets and Gables everywhere Dwayne so here's what we actually did but so they dude they look cool man they do but what happens is the architect gets to design the tajma hall and then the Builder gets to be the messenger to say you can't afford this or they're going to million what so in this case there were seven of those brackets that were 660 bucks each those Gable Peds whatever you want to call them you're an architect call it whatever you want to call it uh and then these corales or brackets there were six of those at 250 bucks around the house I mean that's 6K six grand that a lot of times Falls by the wayside on the budget acts right that happens a lot um in this case we went ahead and did it so anyway it's just one of those things to point out that uh even like metal roofs or things like that be cautious of what they're you're adding because the client may not know they don't know any difference they don't know that these things cost 660 bucks each they don't know that a metal roof is 8x the price of a shingle roof or 5x or 10 whatever it is point is it it could be60 $70,000 more so if they're looking a set of drawings with that metal roof and then I go well that's 60k oh no we want shingles then we back to changing it out um now this is a a house that you know how a SketchUp model got me a million dollar job right so uh I got the set of plans this guy and I'm looking at it I'm going what's this dash line in the garage it's a cathedral ceiling in the garage why does he want that so I reached out to him and I said you know what's with the cathedral ceiling in the garage he go I'm a car guy I want a car lift in there I've got two sports cars want want to park one under the other and rais the other one up and I'm going yeah that's not going to work so all I did is popped into SketchUp I modeled a couple framed walls I mocked up the exact scissors trust that was featured in there and showed him that the cars would be banging into the ceiling right but I said you know before his blood got boiling I said but let me show you how we can fix that so we came in and did the same roof pitch but I used 2 by8 Rafters I used uh without having the scissors pitch the scissors is where the top cord is different from the bottom cord and that's how you can achieve a cathedral ceiling and still structurally do a truss um the problem with that is a lot of people will do windows I built on a Lake community and there's a lot of these Gables and then there's scissors trusses so the the the pitch of the windows is half of the pitch of the roof and it just looks horrible so in this case we used 2 by8 Rafters ceiling joist in there to get the Headroom that you needed we actually took this uh funny looking Dormer that wasn't centered or anything and we we actually he wanted to have a center Bay on a lift that he could actually work on cars so he had two car lifts and so we moved that Dormer to the center and gave him that full height headro that's full height front to back or front to the back slope so anyways cool way he was super happy but he would have been super unhappy had he gone with another Builder uh here's a common thing is stair uh Headroom issues at stairs very common uh where people aren't doing a 3D model and detecting clashes like this so when we first did this and we put this 18in trusses in there you're banging your head right here so before we got any further than that we do constructibility where we get the trusses and we actually bring them in to make sure that they work before we we order them so I knew that we were going to need to use a 2 by floor system right there to get our Headroom so that's what we ended up doing so so again these are issues that may not get thought of in the design phase which should but not everybody sees these especially if you're doing all 2D drawings and not 3D models you know if you're building 3D models like Mike you're going to see these kind of things in front of you um here's one where the stairs were specified out to be 17 risers but it's kind of one of those cases like you're were saying Mike where you see how they've got 9 foot 9 foot and whatever arbitrary numbers using when you use what was actually specified by the structural engineer using these 14in lbls that bumped up that Headroom enough to where it needed one more Riser so 17 risers is only 8 Ines by code can't go more than 7 and 3/4 so that meant 18 risers and what would happen as a builder I can tell you right now this structural members these would have all been installed per this plan and You' had this doubled up lbl doubled up lbl double up lbl doubled up lbl then you would have gone to build the stairs and realize well I can't put another tread here because it's blocked by this door so I got to go this way well that means you'd end up having to tear out basically all of this because you can't extend these lvls so it would have been a nightmare you know had we not caught this by doing a 3D model uh here's a constructibility job we did for a six-story building in Alberta uh where the MEP guys use the Architects plans and to model all the plumbing right so we have Plumbing Stacks water lines gas lines all kinds of stuff coming up through well in this case they designed where this unit on the above has a loadbearing wall there with the plumbing wall is well the unit below there's no wall so the structural engineer just sticks a big eyebeam in there right well the me guys have these water pipes coming up through drains coming up through toilets coming up through another one coming up through and they don't catch that so you've got three different players here that aren't collaborating and talking to one another so I mean again that's a huge gap that needs to be bridged in our industry um a lot of times Architects don't think about uh the hbac returns that are going in in the house right um they almost invariably will take up unless they're predesigned in which is kind of hard to do um they will take up part of a closet right uh in this case we actually had two return errors one took up part of a closet in here and one we actually had to build a Chase just for it and we also do all this before we order while we while we're doing these truss is we use that trust layout to determine and that helps us to shift those trusses if we need to to give access so what we were able to do is show the client hey you're going to have a return error in this hallway here and one over in here well I don't want that well here's you have to have it and here's why okay so I think it would be nice if Architects maybe collaborated with some hbac guy or maybe with the builder if they could or at least be a aware that a return air register is going to have to be involved somewhere and I can tell you now the clients don't like them they don't like looking at them but if you explain up in front and you uh manage their expectations it goes a long way here's where a 2d roof plan they never did anything in 3D obviously everything looked great on the 2D roof plan you know this Gable lined up right with this Ridge everything looked perfect in two but the reality is that was a 16in or 18-in overhang there so you've got a wall that set back there and nowhere to get deal with this water coming out of here so the Builder would have to rig up some sort of a Cricut to get that water out of there again things just aren't visable on a 2d drawing I often see where two levels don't align so one of the things that we do we use that PDF importer tool that uh Mike was talking about we import our floor plans and then we would do a story poll using sketchup's guide points or guide you know guide points where we go from just like he was doing by building that wall level we actually build that out of guide points and make that into a a group of guide points which I actually lock so my erase guides is actually a script called locked guide saver so I use contrl G I think Mike was the e um and when I do that it deletes all the guides except for what was locked in because I want my story poll to be locked in there but what we'll do is we'll then move one floor plan over to a line snapping a line with a common corner and this is where we catch these mistakes takes here was 101 on this upper drawing and 109 on the lower drawing right so I knew this in advance when I modeled it I was able to determine which was correct and make that adjustment to the field set of drawings before it was built so one way we can bridge the gap is with tools like SketchUp endcap and 360 camera so I'll show you how that works through we create realistic uh virtual tours in SketchUp or using our SketchUp model but we do it in inscape so I'll show you what that looks like all right so this is a virtual tour that we put together for a house that we built this year obviously this was done before we built so before we start the house I take out an insta 360 uh 1 x is that X1 what is it Mike you got one of those I got the uh I forget what I have X I have the X3 so gotcha CU I I have whatever one I have that I bought years ago um and so what I do is I go out and I'll capture the full 360 by 180 shot like you're seeing here now I'll go out onto the deck of this house now the client here want this is Smith Mountain Lake Dam uh in Rono or excuse me it's been Lake Virginia outside of Rono where I live and uh they wanted to be looking at the dam all right so we literally put a steak in the ground my guy we have an rpt600 a trimble unit that we use to stake out our houses and to shoot our Vol topography and we literally set two stakes in the ground pointing directly at the dam we shot those two stakes came back to the office and then we aligned the site with that view so that's why they're looking directly at that view so we're able to an inscape take that 360 image and rotate it until we're seeing what we want to see so the cool thing is here no matter what you look out of whatever window you're looking at the actual view which is pretty awesome now this is House John you you actually used endcap to create what we're seeing right now yes this was all yeah so what we'll do is we have a scene uh in our model in our SketchUp model we use um it's kind of the quick little trick we do is we find the center of the room and we place camera at 56 you know head head ey height basically and we create a scene that positions the camera right in the center point of the room and then we have that for each room okay then we batch render um Mason will leave for the day he'll batch render and nscap come back and have all these Echo rectangular jpegs that we use for these tours then this is then processed inside of uh we use right now we're using a system a service called Cloud Pano and that allows us to upload all these and then to add all these hotspots so you're seeing the hotpots you have here kind of like the matterport thing but so we do as much realism as we can you can see Mason even puts the thermostats on the wall shut up Mike um we do electrical outlets and switches now this is one of those things where the designer this is this is a little spill in the beams here but see this 1x2 baseboard that got used in here um it was originally 1x6 you know and anytime I go to 1x8 1 by 10 or even 1X 12 which I wouldn't do 1X 12 in a 9ft ceiling it's just a little too much I definitely do 1 by8 anytime I go past the 1 by six though we rotate the outlets and put them an extra so we got a bottom plate We'll add another 2x4 block just to space it up and then we put them horizontally so your Outlets are actually in the baseboard so I wasn't aware of this until after we had already roughed in the house and drywall so I could not change that so that was kind of a little pet peeve but the uh so the kitchen turned out okay it wasn't too crazy tile wasn't too crazy of the selection and we get these things looking I mean as accurately as possible My Guy Mason in the office will model the plumbing fixtures and lighting fixtures to the best of his ability sometimes spending too much time on them um but one of the things that we had as the designer I'm going into this green laundry room yeah folks that is what it looks like today uh so when we did the virtual tour we thought well they'll see it and they'll hate it but that's what the interior designer selected but no they loved it it originally had green Walls too like a different green and then this clashy green right here this is this is like exactly what you see in real life and and they love it so as long as they love it that's cool uh and it also has some crazy wallpapers let me pop upstairs sorry this is fun so we actually have floor plans too so you can navigate floor plans you can also navigate with thumbnails which is kind of cool uh so if you go up into this uh to the sun's room wow green whatever wallpaper so here's a picture of what it actually looked like I'm gonna actually exit full screen here for a second uh so I can pull up this image uh yeah that's a photograph versus what he showed and yes we love it I'm going man I don't uh and then so then the bathroom check this one out in the girls bathroom that's what we have we have blue cabinets with this crazy wallpaper going on so if I I go into I'm going to pop over into my tour here cool house though man yeah um this was Dwayne Addy and I designed this one so shout out to Dwayne so yeah there it is man Dwayne hasn't seen this yet he's going to puke but uh yeah see see how see how close that is even the colors Mason did a great job of matching colors and all that stuff what about the out yeah nailed it on the outlet yeah well actually ours has the uh we have one that's got the GFI out there you like that yeah so M Mike gives me complete hell over uh the detailed models that we do but that's part of the whole uh Bridging the Gap right I mean this is the ultimate bridging of the Gap where all the collaborators can be on the same page so well it but it also makes sense I get it like you know and this is kind of a realization as we're working on this presentation that um you are using your models for a different purpose you're You're Building off the plan whereas I'm essentially making the plans from the model you're you have the plan and now you're you're you're plotting your attack at building this thing so I I kind of get it now so although when you complain about it I do think of the thermostats and I think there's there's your problem man so well I will I will plug a plugin a free plugin that Trimble actually created called material resizer um and I you may have told me about it Mike but I literally took some of our files that were 200 megabytes and reduced some of these crazy materials like Mason may pull in a hardwood flooring texture that looks cool well that thing might be 3 megabytes alone and so we've been drastically cutting down our file sizes by just using material resizer just that one simple tool so jot that one down all right so up next we're going to take a look at one of John's uh well it's a bathroom model it's a portion of a house here and we're going to send it over into layout to create some floor plans and kind of like I mentioned you know John builds or designs the plan in 2D and then kind of uh uses framer and builds these really detailed models for a different purpose you know I'm I'm kind of used to building the 3D model that Nets the plans and he takes it from a different direction for a different reason but uh doesn't mean that we can't get a floor plan from this model so uh right out of the box on a fresh install our conduct tools extension automates plan sections elevations and perspectives based on whatever tags are visible so I want to turn off all of these tags except for uh our floor plan and our dash line so I'll just turn those off so basically I just need to manage my tags uh manually and then I'll hit the uh plan generator and we're going to create a color floor plan I'll click create plan and then that's going to set the camera view to be overhead uh pick a style it names my scene and uh gets it all sorted out like that I'll hit reset the reset button always kind of bounces you back out to uh kind of a lightweight working area here I'm going to update my uh update my design scene so it doesn't have that uh active section plane there and let me look at this uh scenes design active section plane we're good all right the other thing I want to do is Snapshot some interior elevation so I could kind of get down into this bathroom and then activate the elevation tool and click on that wall and for this one I'm going to do a color interior elevation and then it'll bring me back to that same view like that and then we'll go to this wall and do a color interior elevation like that and we'll spin around just a little bit further like that and we'll snapshot a view over here so color interior elevation so so that's just created our scenes here what I typically like to do is kind of work through I know that I want to work on this area of the plan so I'm going to update that scene so that it's a little bit easier to get there uh once we're in layout and then same thing with these uh I always kind of go take a look at all of my drawings in SketchUp before I send them over into layout just to uh so I don't have to do so much uh cropping over there um like that and then over here dude you know how much time that saves what you're doing right now uh what's that the updating the scenes or the the elevation tool snapshots so just those snapshots are amazing oh yeah man it's I like I think I made a video a long time ago like you know takes uh the 12 Steps uh that are are saved between you know adding the section plane and like oh here this is a good example here actually not you bring it up uh we add a section plane uh pick a style uh name the scene you can see that we Nam these one two and three um it with the full like uh condoc Interiors or architect you know if you load those drawing sets um these guys have all the tags baked in but I just thought we'd use flex because that's kind of an easy one to work with uh this is a good opportunity to show a new tool that is actually free on the extension warehouse and uh it's also part of our new release uh condo 5.3 so we have uh two new tools isolate active section planes and Purge unused section planes so uh for instance like on this drawing right here like we're slicing through the bathtub and maybe that's not ideal so I need to get to that active section plane so I could go to view and turn on Section planes and then you know select this section plane and then scoot it around but what happens is you you often end up with a lot of section planes it can be hard to dig through these so we have this new tool isolate active section plane and that just uh hides all of the other uh turns on Section plane visibility and then hides all the inactive section plane so I makes it really easy to like you know scoot this back and then I can go check that so that looks a little bit better I'm getting a better view so that's awesome yeah and here's the other one is uh Purge unused this one might not have any uh yeah it doesn't have any unused section planes but you know if you just had like a rogue uh you know throw like a section plane in there uh like this and then uh go back to the scene well any section plane that is not attached to a scene is going to get deleted so you can see there's one like that all right so that's uh that's how our uh condo tools uh works with the flex drawing set and then we can send these out to layout and we can get back to talking about uh kind of this Bridging the Gap between design and reality so let's hop over into layout so inside of layout I'm going to start a new document and we're going to go with uh our templates will be a 24 by 36 start like that and then I'll just double check and sketch up that just finished exporting so then we can uh go to our condoc drawings so whenever you export out of SketchUp they always land in your conduct drawings scrapbook and we've you know set the scale uh you know not so much on Flex where we optimize line weights but we've definitely optimized the render settings uh you know for for the different types of drawing so here's a interior elevation and we'll scoot that in and it it's kind of cool like uh I guess the layout API doesn't have ambient occlusion included in it but once I render this thing it should kind of dial up that style like that so we just stretch these around and and um you know crop a few like that and let's build this set real quick like that bring in these other guys and then go to the next like that all right it's going to take me a half an hour my old way the old way right um yeah I mean I get it too you know like if you're working with templates and all that that that can be handy but I just find that like uh the reason I you know it's funny we we all have the same story like we build these plugins because we need them and then uh you're like oh man I could you know sell this other people need these too uh but you know it's like I kind they're born out of necessity yeah that's it man it's like I I was working with templates and I found that like no matter how clever my template was it didn't address you know all the scenarios it's better to have the flexibility um I'll just go back to my cond annotations like this and uh this is another scrapbook that gets installed and so we can just throw down like some drawing titles and then you can throw like some you know interor elevation call outs wherever you want them and room names and all that so uh you know we really just kind of like when you install KCT Tools in SketchUp you get everything you need all in one like all the title blocks templates uh annotations all that but point of this now is that we've got like a floor plan here and I thought we' like walk through with John like what are the critical Dimensions to call out uh here so yeah can you help me out I'll just as you talk through them uh I'm going to sample the uh half inch scale and then yeah just talk me through some critical dimensions on this plan if you would yeah so in this case there's the the minimum required openings that we have drove the design here and drove the floor plan that's why it was important these dimensions are are crucial that a lot of people don't know about so by code I have to have a minimum 34in opening once I get through the front door I've got to get to a bedroom and a bathroom with minimum 34in openings right so that's a code issue and so that first one I made it a 36 CED opening right so the rough opening for a CED opening is 3 fo2 or or excuse me rough opening for a 3 opening is you add 2 in to the size of the door what that's doing is giving you 3/4 of an inch plus a shim space on both sides okay that's what the 2 in extra is for and again like I mentioned earlier I like to go 4 and 1/2 and 4 and 1/2 so that makes a hallway 31 it's not 4T it's not 31 is 31 so that's why you're going to see that dimensionally being 311 right so then we have our wall defined that separates our great room from the master bedroom so that's where I go the 4 and 1/2 to give me room for the case that I have the 32 for my rough opening for a door uh now I can't use a 210 door even though 34 in is 2 fo10 a door will have stops on it so I'm limited to that would give me 33 in clear so I have to go to the 36 in door so that drove those Dimensions the 4 and 1/2 then the 32 and then the 4 and 1/2 that defined that hallway right there right so that's where that came from for the DI that you're going to see there okay that's that defined that wall that develops for or generates that hallway so then if you went into that hallway that's going to the bathroom it's back to that same principle I've got uh now this case yeah same case I got a three door that's going into the bathroom so I've got the same 31 hallway and that's what defined the closet to the left right so then um you'll see down the pocket door that goes into that closet to the right right that's where I actually did cheat my my rule of the 4 and 1 12 in I went 3 in which is two two eyes on that side of the pocket door because I wanted to give a little bit more room for hanging clothes right so it's kind of tight as it is so that extra inch and half helps and if the casing is uh I don't want it to be ripped but if it's tight against that inside of a closet I that doesn't bother me visually um sometimes it's literally just tight to it and that's fine or maybe they have to rip a tad off of it so breaking the rule right there okay so then we're going into the bathroom itself and you'll see that the we've got a toilet room all right we've got to get into that toilet with the same 34in opening and width for the toilet I like to use 3 ft clear drywall to drywall so that means 3' one so there should be a 3' one dimension on that toilet back wall of the toilet um right there you go all right now this was a case where the wall to the right there was generated by that hallway to get to the bathroom the wall to the left is locked in with an exterior wall and I've got to get a door that will pass code to get into that toilet room so what I did here is a pocket door frame or pocket door opening is it's a you'll see it's I got a 210 door without any stops on it that gives me my 34 in right but I have to work from the left side because a pocket door frame rough opening for a pocket door is 2 * the width of the door plus 1 in so that would be 34 * 2 is 68 + one so when I did 69 in I can go right to the interior portion of that exterior wall the pocket door can go all the way back to that Framing and it's fine but when I did 69 in going the other direction that left me only 4 in on that jam side to the right so I again I broke my rule uh but 4 in is fine they'll do two tuis and they'll rip apply what or something like that in there for just that one case so that can't win them all right can't win them all made it made it fit code right there so that's right um I guess other dimensions would be you know making sure that um that you've got clearance from the bathtub that's there the soaking tub you know you don't want it too tight to the vanities I these are again these are architectural things that you guys uh you guys have a great sense for spatial needs uh with those kind of things that's not like the technical stuff I'm getting into with being picky about Dimensions M um I guess one thing I note too is that shower is actually a curbless shower I mean it may look like from the drawings but the the client wanted to be a curbless shower so um it's a good thing to note or to ask your clients because if no notes on there like if you didn't ask them then the floor system gets stuck in then you can't do curbless if we Builders know about that in advance then we would be able to notch the floor down or actually uh in some cases we'll do that within the trusses that will uh allow us to recess it down all we need is that inch and a half and we can work with that we can actually work with 3/4 we in fact uh we've had jobs where that was overlooked or decided later and we literally cut the subfloor out where the shower goes and dropped blocking down 3 and 1/2 in or 3/4 of an inch and then put nailers in there and then we put little strips of plywood in there so the top of the you'd have the top of the truss top of the sheathing top of the truss top of the sheathing so it lined up and we're able to still do the shower that way but again these are just kind of little uh I consider the bridge in the Gap because we don't want code issues right right plenty of times yeah we don't want these issues and you as an architect don't want a client or a builder calling you up going hey man what you drew didn't pass code and blah blah we could probably all feel that little tinge of pit in the stomach of those conversations so by doing these kind of rules I think it helps to again to bridge that Gap yeah well it's a balance right it's like there's rules I mean it's just like you know what I was showing with Denver you know you oh yeah just go build it super tall or whatever it's like no it's there's what looks good and there's what's allowed and we got to find that uh the the in between there that's pleasing every every angle of this thing so that's cool exactly right nice right on well uh then we're going to start wrapping things up with a a look at uh spot like your your new extension that again Bridging the Gap between um the Builder and the interior designer or designers in general but in this case tracking selections and uh so you're going to show us uh your screen on that one sure this is that same model right but so in this session description mentions enhanced collaboration and streamline workflows right and so I think SketchUp along with extensions is the best way to achieve these goals you know so Mike your you know your conduct tool certainly allows your users to streamline their workflow what you did was amazing how fast that was put together you know so we recently developed spot for SketchUp right and that allows us to streamflow uh streamline our workflow with uh tracking all the selections and products that go into a house so it helps us to collaborate with all the stakeholders all right so spot allows us to document estimate and track all the products and even Labor uh and the Selections in our projects so I'll show you what that looks like uh this is spot right here cool little logo that I actually created using SketchUp which was kind of neat all right so in spot you add levels and spaces now I call it spaces because a deck could be it's it's a space you need to track the decking the railings things like that but you wouldn't call it a room so uh that's allows to do porches and other things in there so you do the levels and then you can add spaces we won't get into anything more past that I've only added this one room in here okay for right now this master bedroom so you can see in here that there's 18 items that are currently needing to be selected there's actually two more that I'm going to show you that I had overlooked so I'm going to show you how we how we can dial those in but the cool power is this traffic like dashboard right so it it allows us to see well what's not been selected what has been selected but not ordered and then it's received and installed now these two are the ones that the field guys are going to be keeping up with right so uh what it does is it comes in with this nice um uh we have a room view here which is basically a ual storyboard of of each item and it's thumbnail image now the thumbnail image that you're seeing here these are SketchUp thumbnail images of the components in my model right so the idea is we start out with it's basically a placeholder like you can see bath bit TBD to be determined we've got two of them they're identical there's one left and right of these vanities so we have a quantity of two in my database in my items database I've got a generic bath F that's 300 bucks right plus our tax that sort of thing um the idea is that once the client picks out the one they want you could change the status to selected or you could update it in here change the status to you know from NE selection to selected you could then um check put the description in there what's the name of it what's the brand what's the model number what's the color you could put all that information in uh put a date for when that was made uh put the actual price in here you could actually break the link to our database right here and uh change the price so it it doesn't change back to what you you have in your database so it's pretty powerful and then your uh your final image here will be the actual image from the website for the product right so you can see it's also organized by cost codes so we have a category view this is the this is basically your estimate View and it's done by by cost codes now you don't have to use cost codes but it's a great way to organize your uh your models right or organize all these things otherwise it' just be alphabetical order you might have a chair next to a dishwasher next to a faucet you know it wouldn't make a lot of sense uh and also with each room we have a storyboard feature that will autogenerate a storyboard for you it'll automatically create a PDF uh that fits several to a page I could pop one up here uh let's see what that looks like bring it over here in blue beam that I had over another screen so you can see how it created this storyboard automatically right I didn't do anything but click that button and it'll have the need selection now we're going to work on a way of customizing this because I know a lot of interior designers want to customize their storyboards but I didn't have to go into any other software I didn't have to go out to layout I didn't have to do any of that right it's automatically generated what's uh what's that QR code all about the QR code is meant to it doesn't work right now it's it's a placeholder but the idea is that you could have that posted out on the job site and then you know scan that QR code to learn more about that you know that product so or you can have it out you could have it in the plans and you could scan it you would always be getting whatever's on the on your server so it's the most recent data you don't want anything that's outdated because this stuff trust me as a builder these things will change constantly clients change change them the idea is that spot is uh single point of Truth single point of truth that's what spot stands for thank you Mike uh we do have a we're developing a SAS platform that does this very same thing you're seeing here doesn't rely on SketchUp it SketchUp the accompanying plugin so this is how we can really get our takeoffs which is hugely important we can get full estimates done in here um so let me show you how that's done real quick so you can see all the different items we have in here we have Plumbing fixtures lighting fixtures pink col right this is where you would actually put in whatever your Sherman Williams 7362 name of the paint whatever that is you could also grab quantities by selecting the get by collecting areas you know we have vanities we have the granite countertops again You' put the actual one that you want to use in there shower drain bath we have bath floor tile we have the shower floor tile that you see here and I forgot to do the shower walls which will show you how to do here in a second mirrors these are custom mirrors so I can just simply collect those faces and instantly pop out I've got 37 ft of tile of of mirrors and then my bath Hardware right and then a shower door we got the shower door that has to be accounted for so that's a ton of stuff but let me go ahead and show you how this works as far as adding a new item I'm going to zoom up I forgot to do this little tub faucet a quick question te from a technical standpoint like uh do they will it work with groups or is it only components that that you're PR works with groups works with groups nice nice okay yep even nested groups right yeah so so I'm just going to select it then I can come over here and click plus selection item here and you'll see it automatically pulled up the thumbnail image I could uh I could rotate here a little bit and then say current View and it'll give me a different view of it I can do you know 2D front view if you wanted something more simplistic but I mean again it doesn't really matter this is a placeholder until you've picked out the final product all right and so um actually I had didn't know this one before so I already pulled up all the information that it had in here so we're up to 19 items right now so let me show you how to get this shower wall tile in here so let's come over here into uh we're going to be off of selections you want to be on a certain uh if you're selected on the SketchUp object it's going to import that one so I'm going to say add selection item um I'm going to come in here and type in master well just shower wall tile and for right now the description I'm just going to put wall tile TBD cuz we don't know what it is yet it's in the master bathroom I'm going to come over here to tile and here's my tile materials and now it's going to look into my item codes I have shower walls in my item codes in here so you automatically pulled up the six bucks a square foot but now I got to get my quantity right so I've got this cool picker tool and I'm going to choose I got length area or volume I'm going to choose length and all I have to do is hover over face click that's 55 Square F feet click now we're up to 84 click yeah just just simply clicking on these faces and I'm calculating as I go or I'm I'm accumulating all these areas as I go right so you better about that I mean you know your estimator tools killer but like it was estimating based on the material and if you accidentally painted something or the backs side um this I like this picker tool where it it's awesome know it also do you see how it pulled up the thumbnail image too yeah automatically now it's kind of image so yeah so then I just add that item and now I'm up to the 20 items and then I could print out my story board and go from there so so that's how we're tracking all of our products and selections you know I failed to mention too one little quick add is it's not just a once and done so I could come over here to this tile that we just added I can edit that and click this little plus button here let's say I wanted to add uh material or labor for that so I could come in say tile and choose tile labor and then choose from there I have a tile labor square foot for shower walls and it's going to use that same quantity that's going to come over here and update it so now when I go back over to category View and I pop over to my tiles you can see I've got my my labor in there as well so it's a pretty cool trick yeah man even the even the shower drain that we have in there so that way cuz all these things you know when when the guy's out in the field and this stuff is delivered uh they need to know what to expect right they could have a manifest or sometimes you'll have something on back order and and so this way you could say okay one of them was one of them was received one of them was was not so uh it's just a good way of tracking all the products and then the guys in the field have a visual of that too they'll see that thumbnail image and they'll say hey this is a chrome faucet it was supposed to be or rub bronze you know and these mistakes happen on a daily basis in the construction industry so we're on a mission to try to to eliminate those bridge the gap exactly that's it bridge the gap that's right exactly uh well I think you've done it with this this is like I'm just I'm kind of imagining how the like a SketchUp model can be handed off you know um really flexible too like if if an interior designer was working on this and then handed it over to a builder who's using spot like it'd be so easy to just whip their model into shape you know right and they could even add all these trim pieces that you're seeing in there we could have a length tool we could collect all these pieces of one4 four casing 5/4 by six head casing all that stuff can be done using the Picker tool just by clicking on it so you know an estimator we do with profile Builder where we typically extrude everything with profile Builder and then have that be on a tag um and then it'll report the lineal footage but here it doesn't matter how it was modeled because a lot of people are going to model with profile Builder or make it look as pretty as we do you know they'll just maybe make it look like baseboard and uh so this way we collect all those different attributes as a builder I could go in and collect all those from uh a designer's model and get all the interrogated for all the information that I need to get my estimates no matter how it looks yeah nice cool stuff right on man and this is available coming soon right yes sir hopefully by the time we uh hit base camp awesome yeah man I mean that was excellent that was like uh you know I think it's easy to see the importance of you know the 3D models and I think we all agree that like a 3D model is a great tool to communicate and you know hopefully this presentation illuminates how uh it can be used to communicate from the designer and to the client to the Builder and you know everyone all the the stakeholders in the project um yeah do you have any final thoughts on that John no I think it was great I mean it's it's it's fun to collaborate and you know we each have our own expertise right so uh it's I mean joining forces on something like that only makes the project that much better you know all right well cool man I'll see you in Vegas for uh base camp and uh we'll do it again so sounds greate see you man
