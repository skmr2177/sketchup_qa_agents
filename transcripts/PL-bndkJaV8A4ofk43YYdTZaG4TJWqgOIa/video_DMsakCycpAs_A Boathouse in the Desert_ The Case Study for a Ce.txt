my name is Micah seon I am the owner of seon studio and uh today I'm going to share about a project that I've been working on in Moab Utah so uh this is a boat house in the desert the case study for a central model uh that's a picture of me and uh that's a building that I built over the summer behind me it was designed in SketchUp and uh built the whole thing myself C1 anyway uh project for another day but ultimately that's going to become my office I see myself as a pretty Hands-On designer and uh really think through the details of what we're building a little bit about sex and Studio I work with my wife Emily who's here in the crowd uh she is a landscape architect and planner and I run the architecture side of things uh our work focuses on experiential architecture based on environmental context we Forge holistic design from the land structure and true building materials emphasis on context little bit about little bit about me um and my history so I grew up in Colorado and my first job was for an Architecture Firm in Boulder small threers office and uh when I got hired on the first project they they handed to me was spider skiarees headquarters which was pretty rat uh simultaneously my boss handed me a book it was about SketchUp and layout and said hey really interested in using this workflow I want to get away from doing AutoCAD and not really interested in doing Bim or Revit so uh took it and ran with it we designed that project that was a 40,000 foot office space um I went on to do Mackenzie and Company offices in Denver also in SketchUp and layout and honeybee robotics uh in lawnmont which I think is a 880,000 squ foot facility all sketch up and layout uh later on I landed a job at Cutler Anderson Architects uh out on Banbridge Island and when I got there I was handed a really extremely complex project uh abroad it was a a renovation project of a three-story building that was leaning and the walls were like castle walls really thick at the bottom and uh tapered as it went up and they also hand me a Bim model that had been created that was just a total basket case um so push came to shove and I ended up bringing SketchUp to that office and showing them uh how we could actually model all the uh custom things that the the architect Jim Cutler wanted so really intricate windows and details and just about every tile and structural column and uh air register was all modeled and SketchUp and layout so uh just saying that to show that even these highend architecture firms have a need for SketchUp and it's not really being tapped into so uh enough about me and my history and uh I want to share with you the project so this is the site that I've been working on uh it's not far outside of Moab maybe 10 minutes or so and it's a irrigated hay field Valley surrounded by Cliff walls and kind of you know these beautiful Rock outcroppings uh and a true Canyon Rim there's an existing Pond that you can see out there and a creek that runs through the middle of it uh the pond is itself is is fed by a natural spring which is kind of an oasis you know this is truly in the desert right now we're in Los Vegas this is the far west side of the great uh Basin Desert Moab Utah is on the far west side of the Great Basin Desert so uh and they call the Great Basin Desert because everything in that environment or or within that bull all drains within itself Moab itself is probably uh 6 hours outside of Denver so I'm in Evergreen Colorado uh I'll come out to the site relatively frequently and uh have done a lot of work in the field here this is another view so it's uh it's a stunning Place uh it's one of the Rock outcroppings and again the existing Pond a little bit about the the sailboat the uh the owner of this property he he bought a house and I guess the previous owner of that house had a sailboat sitting in the driveway and didn't take it with him so uh the owner was like hey what am I going to do with this so he put it out here in this pond that's maybe twice the size of the room that we're standing in right now it's it's like a one acre pond so um you know I can't say that they do a whole lot of sailing but they'll kind of push it out there and you know sip on some margaritas and and get some sun and and jump off into the lake so this is a really cool spot he he him and his family love to go there and uh yeah just just spend time with their family and do all the things that you'd want to do at a lake uh this is a rock outcropping looking the other way so just some really beautiful geologic features these are all Sandstone um the irrigated Hayfield you can see little maybe black dog here on the Le hand side that's my border colie Panda U I got another picture of him in here he goes with me on a lot of these site visits and so anyway Min side note another thing that's really unique about this property is it actually has a bunch of caves on it um I believe they're all man-made from different times I think some Dat Back to the 1800s this one's quite a bit newer this one actually punches out the sidewall of one of the cliff uh faces that we were looking at and the owner I've been working with him and he wants to put a balcony out here and I would love to do a 3D uh scan of these caves because there's some other elements that we're talking about doing uh some whiskey tasting and he does some special events uh in these in these caves so here's the same cave that we were looking at down from the other side uh so it's probably 2530 feet off the ground and really great I mean just a cool opportunity for for views and the experiential we'll call it architecture it doesn't exist yet but experiential architecture of this place few other caves uh so he uses these for storing his cars and he also harvests hay at this at this field and stores the hay there we're going to put some some big doors over the the top of these to to seal them off he's had some issues with bats so we're working on that currently um and then this is another cave that you can actually drive in so um I believe uh Jeep Wrangler unveiled their their Moab edition of uh their new their latest and greatest Jeep Wrangler and they filmed it coming out of this cave so that's that's my Jeep Cherokee it's uh I love it but uh it's a little it's it's kind of a classic these days and uh anyway that's that's my border colly Panda sitting in the back seat another thing that this site has is petroglyphs uh pretty pretty interesting if you've ever spent any time in this area anywhere here on the Southwest there there are petroglyphs and Clay shards and Remnants everywhere of previous civilizations uh really incredible these are things that we we want to preserve and protect for generations to come so these are some really cool ones I have no idea what they mean these little Teletubby guys um holding basketballs or something another view uh some really great cottonwood trees there's those caves in the back and again a uh a cliff Rim that kind of RI uh lines this whole valley so this is another shot the owner decided to add another irrigation Pond to the site so he he had just built this and filled it with water he still got to put a clay liner in there make sure that it will hold water but this was his very first test um we're going to put the buildings that I'm going to show you here at this location uh this is where the primary house is going to be over where that dog is in in the background and again just some really incredible views that we we want to capture and accentuate through our architecture when we started the project we didn't have any topography or or a survey to go from so we actually use GIS uh this is global mapper don't like using GIS um but yeah I I know just enough to get done what I need to get done and after actually going to a couple sessions here at this conference I'm excited to uh streamline this this process and make things a little bit more efficient but essentially this is a lar scan was able to cut uh one foot Contours or 5 foot Contours whatever I needed from it and then uh a lot of jurisdictions have free GIS data that you can download and use so state of Utah has a bunch of national parks and all kinds of mining that happens there in that state they have a ton of GIS assets so I was able to get hydrology roads um parcel boundaries pretty much anything that was really critical you can also get well locations if you're interested in in that so uh from that information I was able to uh do some side analysis so this image is capturing the heating Degree Days of this particular site and locating where the views are looking kind of up the canyon um there's some some views to the Lal mountains which would be uh east of this site and everything in architecture is access to views and access to Natural Light and maybe a little bit of water so from that topography that I generated I brought it into SketchUp and we use this for our side analysis so this is a solar Shadow study uh so not a not survey Contours but pretty good and uh we turn the Shadows on at different times of the day and at different months so this is a plan orthographic projection of those Contours overlaid the roads those are buildings uh new and proposed and then these are Shadow studies of what's Happening across the surface of the Earth throughout different times of the day and different months so we picked key times of the day key times of the year and this is all done just native SketchUp Shadow uh Shadow tool let's see so see go to my next slide using that information we extracted them or exported them to jpegs and we mapped out so uh just like I was talk telling you uh 10: a.m. January 10: a. April 10: a.m. July 10: a.m. October all these key times of the day at uh you know the the solstice and the Equinox months and this helps us see what's going on there we we want to put a house in an ideal location that's not going to be in the shade all the time in the winter and uh not going to be in the sun all the time in the summer and this is a composite of those overlays so there's a lot of things that can be understood from doing analysis like this and for us it it kind of um clarified and so solidified what we understood of the site so kind of identified three key key locations for the primary house and this has evolved uh as as we went through the project this is a early site plan that we did uh a lot of this is duplicated in SketchUp this particular image was generated in in Photoshop uh a composite with aerial image in the background and uh the actual site plan has evolved quite a bit since then which bring brings me to the architecture so this is the boat house and uh I will show you some more about that it's also okay yeah this is the boat house and we have three buildings on the site so primary residence which is the boat house uh it's where the owner his wife and his two kids are going to live and then this is the shop so uh he has an excavator that he wants to do maintenance in and uh keep it nice and warm in there so he can work on it and the in the winter the lower level of this is for uh storing vehicles and boats and then there's also a wood shop on the other side and I'll show you some of those things here in a little bit the third building is a pavilion uh this is on the existing Lake that we were looking at and uh so no real proper amenities in terms of bathrooms or anything like that but kind of everything that you'd want at an awesome hangout spot so uh wood burning fire fire pit uh there's a grill and this dock that uh you know you could put kayaks and canoes in and kids are going to be running off this dock jumping into it into the lake and uh running back around so yeah let's talk about the central model so for for this presentation I'm going to focus on the boat house primary residence uh but it's the same process that I use for all three buildings um and this is how I do my construction document ation ultimately so we're going to dive into the details a little bit but I want to show you the the design and and uh design intent first before we we go to that so this is a a flyth through so it's got a two-car garage there's a basement level with clar story windows that looks look out so they get natural light the master bedroom a great room with windows on both sides we got some excellent views of this property and uh we want to we want to Accent accentuate that through our building forms this big open area at the front that's kind of like a patio we're calling the Flyway and it's got a hot tub that hangs off the side and axial relationships to the inside with a fire pit Beyond also really try to line things up with corridors uh you know what what is a corridor and how do you define it this this happens to be kind of like a dock um you know there's some there's some uh influences of what a boat house might be even though this this happens to be a piece of architecture it's it's influenced by what a boat might look like uh so that water is not a waterfall it's actually a down spout so we're going to have a gutter collection system and it's just just going to drop right into that and kick out so uh you we're in the desert when it rains we want water to be celebrated and uh I'm a huge fan of rain chains and these these uh water drain kicks and back to the garage the water here at the front is a rain Garden um yeah so now I'll show you a little bit more of intimate interior views these are looking out this is looking into the kitchen and living room big steel door that separates the the living space from the bedrooms Beyond and again everything's on axial relationships and we'll talk about that but these all these views these openings line up with The Rock outcroppings Beyond and and some of the cave openings that I was showing you earlier and we're going to get to that I have cruciform form or cruciform columns with wood packed out uh yeah now I'm going to talk about the model itself so I draw all my framing members this is the structural steel Canever and the first floor and we're just moving our way down through the model floor system this is the basement level and I'm going to pause it real quick this is so again this is SketchUp this is the exact same model that we were looking at and I am building the bases for my orthographic views that are going to be used for my documentation a lot of you guys know exactly what I'm looking at but for those of you that don't um yeah this is what I'm going to be uh bringing into layout and labeling and documenting and start in the basement we're going to work work our way up so um this is the first floor and now we're moving up to maybe a lower roof plan this is the framing of that ceiling clar story uh little note here so I use uh some of Nick Saunders pointers this is a roster view um I don't do roster views with with all of my layers turned on uh mostly because I don't want to make the contractor print everything in color every time uh sometimes colors can get a little bit murky and muddy uh depending on what you're showing and so for me I try to have more industry standard CAD documents that are black and white and then I'll use kind of like these gray hatches behind accent what I want to show so this is a a view that that's going to become a roster view in my layout and right now we're looking at at the beams that are important for framing and we'll see that here in a little bit so more framing plans this is the high roof framing plan and then the total roof plan uh moving on to elevations so I really like um well yeah set set these orth orthographic projections I will also do an option to have uh roster images in the background and I'll set that as a layer so that you know I've had enough enough times with contractors where they say ah I don't want to deal with color printer plans but color printer plans especially in PDF form are super helpful for them and for uh the owner or if you have like a design rev viw board so I'm of the opinion of you know I'm so tired of hearing about it I'll just give it to you all of the ways um so I'll I'll stack a roster image in the back for a certain PDF set turn off that layer and layout and then only show the black and white CAD cadish lines again this is all SketchUp no AutoCAD but um that's what contractors are used to seeing so yeah these are my elevations and now now we're going to go through sections so my camera scene stays the same and I am just sliding through the building uh that tells the story to the contractor about how this thing actually gets put together another little note is uh I draw my own hatches in SketchUp I've had all kinds of issues trying to figure out how to do that in layout and I know you know Nick Saunders he's like ah it doesn't even matter we don't even need to see insulation for it I've had all kinds of issues uh at the county with them rejecting plans uh because that's where they want to see them and if you've ever tried to permit anything in a city like Denver Denver is an extremely uh rigid planning department and they will not change the way that they see things for you so uh I have to provide it so I'm actually you know this is this is SketchUp geometry I created my own little little p hatch patch or hatch pattern and it's on its own layer and I'm just layer managing um it's actually not too bad of a workflow it's a workaround I wish there was a better way seems a little bit silly but then again so is Revit so uh yeah and a little bit about that you know if there's I will do anything that I can to not have to work in Revit or AutoCAD and uh so I found a lot of workarounds things like exporting uh to CAD 2D Line work etc happy to share those things with you guys maybe at a later date so let's see show you the next video this one is in layout so this is what my drawing sets actually look like I have my title Block in there I like to have an image at the front that shows what it is that we're building and then a table of contents there is nothing automated about anything that I do I am uh I am very old school and primitive caveman compared to a lot of you guys but that's how I work I would rather do it that way rather than troubleshoot and try to figure out why this plug-in thing is not working but with that said I've seen some pretty great things at this show and uh I'm excited to to implement things and streamline them and uh hopefully make my processes a little bit better see let me back up real quick this is a uh area takeoff calculation super helpful for a contractor they can see uh impermeable surface area how much of the space is conditioned uh somebody could easily take these calcs and plug them in for uh a manual J calculation which helps size mechanical systems for uh for the rooms that we're working in so uh we have about 12,000 square feet of space on this project uh this is my layout file with my floor plan so yes I use hatches those are uh you know door tags there's nothing Bim about them but that's okay again uh any ex excuse not to have to work in in Revit is fine by me so I'm happy to do things the old school way um so that's my Vector B I don't have a raster in here I've set up my Styles I I like to read the the gray wall poets for walls and this has kind of all the detail that a contractor would want to see let me back up here that was I also do buil-in options so yeah the geometry all set up a layer with with option a option b so right now this is an alternate for the floor plan with uh two two bed bedrooms upstairs as opposed to one big master um and this is something that might be phased for this particular construction the owner's got a young daughter and it might be better for her to be living upstairs rather than down in the basement until she's you know a little bit older yeah there's those Dimension tags they tend to blow out on me but uh I'll admit I am stuck in 2021 so again I know I'm a caveman um and there are probably some better dimensions systems out there nowadays uh and I am going to upgrade I did it once and it scared me a little bit so I I've just been very uh heads down I know what I know and uh you know have been using those processes that work for me so these are framing plans um super helpful a lot of times you'll have a structural engineer on a project and there's redundancies of you drawing something and then they're going in and they're drawing something I'm at a point now where uh I tend to draw more detailed drawing sets than my Structural Engineers so they're like hey you know what you're going to do all the drawings anyway I'll just review and SE your your plans so um that's that's what we're looking at the architecture set is the exact same thing as a structural set and that is really helpful so that you don't have uh any discrep encies between the two drawing sets graphically they're all the same and the information is is the same you don't have to have a QA QC between the two um and that's one of the ways that you can really save time in a project uh where does the time go and it's it's stuff like that oh so this is the raster view of the beams that I was showing you earlier in the SketchUp model uh let me back that up real quick so I want to highlight like the steel of this building and then the wood framing it I'm stacking on top let's see I was so close there we go okay yeah so that the gray lines there those are the steel beams everything that I do is draw an anatomically correct so if it's a W12 by 22 that's the size ibeam that we're seeing in our SketchUp model and then we're overlaying we're stacking a vector view on top and then on to Elevation so I I do e inch scale for overall elevations and this is such a big building I had to break it up I I like to work in quarter scale for just about everything floor plans and sections elevations uh this is really the only way you can get the level of detail that you that you need for a building like this these are hatches in layout try to keep all the geometry and SketchUp with the exception of something like French drains and uh again these hatches you know I've worked out a system that works for me is to have them as a layer uh my OB hatch layer in SketchUp so turning everything off turning it back on I got datm levels everything you'd want to see um and I've heard a lot of times you know I I show this set to people and they're like oh you did this in Revit it's like no I didn't do this in Revit this is all SketchUp and they they like you know lose their minds when they hear that like that's not even possible and uh so showing you guys right now certainly is possible and uh these sets rival Revit drawings and you know revit's really great at documentation and the Bim side of things the wheels fall off when it comes to the actual architecture and maybe that's of a greater conversation but we are seeing that manifested in our cities with the buildings that we're building uh I could look look at a building and say ah that was done in Revit and you can tell because the roof lines they're just not working in three dimensions and they can it's I've had a conversations with a number of you guys people aren't they're just not able to visually see what the the problems are because they're working in 2D orthographic views plans SE and that's it well this is 2024 we have 3D uh which were the first generation ever to have this capability and uh it's not only the future but it's now and 2D orthographic projections are going to go away once we streamline the aut automation process so we're going to have 3D models skip all the construction documentation phase and it's going to go right into a robot that's going to you know 3D print these structures and assemble them uh and we might see that within our lifetimes let's see I think this is on a loop so go to the next one yeah this is just a PDF print out of what what I was showing you so the again these are what my sets look like uh I have perspectives at the front uh probably the first I don't know 10 15 sometimes 20 pages that show these and this is what your contractor is going to be looking at because this tells the information of what it is that we're building uh the the sections elevations you know good for area takeoffs but uh a picture is worth a thousand words and SketchUp just absolutely crushes at the the 3D aspect all the stakeholders know exactly what we're what we're designing clients contractors subcontractors and most more importantly you as the designer so framing uh 3D perspectives this is a really intricate area so trying to figure out what is What's Happening Here in terms of the foundation work and the beams and these things can you know you can keep going into into greater and greater detail um sometimes those get broken out into other 3D smaller 3D models not going to get into detailing today but we can certainly talk about that um I have some work that's posted in the art exhibition Hall with some detailing that I've done um go check it out and I'm happy to share with you how I did that if you're interested some more little detailing things here's that rain kick and again the uh the plans I think I'll just kind of push through these you've seen you've seen most of them everything's labeled I like to have multiple framing plans as you go up the whole building so there's no confusion uh I want to have really clean and accurate drawing sets if I can avoid doing rfis then uh that is my goal if I can do a project without any rfis I've done a good job uh on the opposite end of that that Spectrum if I'm getting rfis it means I miss something so uh that's that's my goal I'd rather be working here in SketchUp and layout rather than blue beam managing rfis and and the quote unquote management side of a project um and again that's where the time goes so this Project's kind of it's it's at a design development stage I haven't done the detailing again uh but we're about to go into that with with the owner and and getting all that sorted out so that's why I'm not showing details at this point uh this is Door and Window schedule again this is is all rudimentary primitive caveman uh stuff in terms of labeling and yeah it takes a little bit of time you just do it once be really thorough about it make sure the design is pretty well set and I would much rather do this you know spend a half day working on this over working in Revit or Arad or some hybrid of all all those it turns into a monster really quick uh Door and Window elevations really helpful to have for the contractor um I can't tell you how many questions I get about you know how big is the door where do you want the mullions and if I if I draw it here I can point this to this drawing and say ah go check out 8 8.2 that will tell you everything that you need to know so saves me time oh and and these are some mood board wordss and uh some some things about detailing and materials so this is kind of our process um yeah which brings me to our workflow structure let's see let me check real quick how are we doing on time oh yeah we're doing good all right so this my uh my workflow model uh it took me a little while to figure out how to represent this but I think this is it this is how I do things so the boat house that we were looking at earlier that architecturally the architecture is my focus of that boat house so that is my central model and I show this on the Le hand side as this inless Loop of what happens in every single project so there's design at the very beginning that goes into the central model we model it in real time with the owner and we get instant graphic communication so what that means owner sees exactly what you're drawing he knows exactly what you mean so there's there's the client the contractor can see that and you can see it as well um so I I would argue that doing this workflow makes you a better designer because you iterating and you're solving those problems internally and having those internal conversations and you're having those conversations with with the client so that's happening with the central model and it's it's not this linear progression of schematic design design development uh that that all the architecture and design firms try to tell you it is because this Loop is is happening throughout the life of a project and it creates all kinds of issues um with a linear progression model that is uh so often used so with SketchUp we can do that the model everything is is modeled perfectly and that is kept up to date throughout the life of the project terms of leaking and updating I think most of you guys probably know how to do that um but you can import this into other models so the architecture model into something like a context model and I'm going to show that here in a little bit if the architecture model changes you can reload it and update it you know if you change the roof forms or whatever in the context model and uh it keeps the context model lighter because you don't have all the scenes and everything that you work through for your construction documents um so anyway enough about that yeah Central model uh I'm showing something like Safa here for building analysis could be other programs or other types of analysis uh so that one's sort of a placeholder the central model be can be used from many different things uh using that same linking and reloading process uh and with this building I actually would love to do some energy analysis so if anybody is here from CFA come find me would love to talk with you uh this is the same model that we're using for photo realistic renderings I don't have any to show at this time um but they will come yeah I'm pretty excited about the new AI features that I was seeing yesterday uh with the PBR graphics and uh rendering is a Prof profession unto itself Matt props to everybody that does it um I'm just focused on design at this point and I just haven't had enough time to do it uh also model to consultant backgrounds so that's a reason why a lot of people in the industry don't use SketchUp is because they say ah I can't extract CAD that's usable for my structural engineer and my MEP um I actually developed my own process for exporting layers from SketchUp conversation for another day but uh it's not the yeah it there is uh some time involved with setting that up but uh I've figured it out and it works really good I've used it for all those projects I was showing you earlier um also Central model to the the drawing set which is layout so that is constantly being relink the whole way through and uh yeah again that design cycle uh that of design into the central model and graphic communication is happening throughout the whole life of the project Cradle to grave uh and sometimes even after the project has been built so why do we use a central model 3D is the most effective form of design communication it transcends language education and experience everybody sees the same thing uh the model is also an asset don't throw it away track changes throughout the life of the project Cradle to grave uh I've seen it so many times in firms they invest heavily in this beautiful SketchUp model everything is relatively well figured out in schematic design and then they they they say Okay pencils down we're done using SketchUp throw it away and let's let's rebuild the whole thing in Revit or uh AutoCAD or whatever and it's I mean that that's like could be months worth of work and I see it happen uh more times than not actually so say hey no no no the model's an asset keep it use it and uh yeah and you SketchUp and layout third the third Point here is uh time efficiency the workflow is streamlined there's no need need to change the design in multiple places or switch programs and there is something to be said about that of switching between programs the time it takes to boot those software programs up and the mental taxation on you of uh of thinking through uh what's the interface what are the buttons that I need to use for for this particular program again where does the time go worked in a number of different offices and I can tell you right now that that's it that that's where the time goes so uh fourth Point here there's more time for iteration means that the design has been studied and evolved clients are happy contractors are happy you as the designer is Happy some really simple rules for modeling um I use perfect perfect modeling in Geometry uh and I would like to start a new movement here at SketchUp base camp for hash no till days um till days are your measurement box at the bottom right hand side of your screen if you know you're sort of plus or minus uh you know a foot or you a 6 inches whatever it might be so I'd say no if if it's six inches let's draw it as six inches uh also perfect layer management everything gets assigned to a layer I use a hierarchy layer uh system I know that there are better ways and you guys all have plugins and some really good ways of doing it again I'm primitive and whatever works for you use it uh I would also say scene and style setup that one's relatively obvious especially going from SketchUp to layout but uh figuring out the styles that work best for you cleaning them up and using them over and over and over again um it's almost mindless at this point and it it's has saved me a ton of time and the four fourth point that sketch up and Beyond is do it right or you you'll do it thce so uh yeah there there's truth to this and there really is no other way except doing it correctly um so some issues with convoluted workflows so yeah I touched on this time Lost in Translation navigation and bootup time there's computer and mental processing time associated with that we've I think we've all been there and uh the industry you know the architecture industry uses these programs and uses every single one of the programs um and again where does the time go second Point here we are the first generation to have 3D uh it's time to rethink and simplify the design process really excited about this um the architecture world has been an orthographic projection since the Egyptian times and that is a really great way to communicate the construction of a project but it has no tangible feeling of what of the experience of that place so so uh I'm excited to get away from 2D Ortho views uh they're super important for construction at this point in time but as far as I'm concerned they're almost totally Irrelevant for design uh the third Point here central model is not Bim um Bim performs the labeling documentation aspects of design uh I know that there's information that can be embedded in components but it lacks the quick iterative tools to graphically communicate um and I've seen this over and over again where you know people are so excited about Bim because of the door and window schedules and uh they've thrown out the architecture as a result of that uh really great projects have have gone into the dumpster from this or and never been built because of this and uh and Bim is currently the way that the whole world Works um I'm just stunned that anything even uh gets built so anyway uh enough of the meat and potatoes of the project um yeah let's get back to some design stuff so uh this is the shop so uh this is a wood shop here at the front and excav uh a big garage Bay for excavator Beyond we have more of those uh these are airplane hanger doors that actually pivot out and we have a fire pit with a with a balcony and all these things look out at this awesome site U that we were looking at earlier so car storage boat storage down below all these uh all these doors open up um actually really interested in using build building instructor to automate these things uh right now I just have two layers uh open position and a closed position um it's been helpful but yeah would be kind of cool to to streamline it yeah so this is all this will all be weathered corten steel and I really wanted this building to uh fit into the site with the the grading of it so I'll show you some more images here in a little bit of that this is inside the the the main shop Bays so that's a 14 foot door that opens out uh they're hydraulically operated we've used them on a number of pro projects in Moab before they're pretty rad um some sliding steel Barn Door sliders this is the wood shop it's a bathroom Beyond stairs that go down to that lower level and then an outdoor uh patio with fireplace let's see got lost here let me go back to primary scene cool and then this is the structure of this building so these these scenes are really helpful for whoever is going to be constructing it I worked really closely with a structural engineer on these projects and we saved a ton of time uh just popping into the model having some Zoom calls and showing them exactly what I what I want to do um let's see all right so there's that one and then I will show you the uh third and final building of the project which is the Pavilion just going to do a quick fly through yeah so patio uh with a dining room table and a grill it's got a a wood burning fire pit and then these uh these Louver doors uh slide open on a barn door track slider depending on what if you want shade or you want Sun so being in the desert if you can keep things in the shade throughout the heat of the summer throughout the day uh they will stay cool and uh simultaneously if you let the sun uh he uh warm a surface it's going to stay warm throughout the whole day so Moab is in climate zone 5B which is the same as Colorado gets a lot of gets a lot of snow and it gets a lot of sun I would say it's it's just different in terms of the temperature swings so they're more dramatic uh they happen much faster again this is all sandstone and sand uh in terms of the the geology so uh there's not a lot of thermal uh Mass here uh with the the environment itself so yeah that's that's the Pavilion and then uh now I'm going to show you the context model so this is the model where uh it's where I hold the site and I will bring in all those three buildings into it um this model gets quite complex in terms of geometry there's these are big files and yeah I'm maxing out the the processing power of my computer but so far uh it's it's worked just fine um so anyway in terms of my workflow each one of these buildings is its own Central model they all have their own drawing sets so three three PDFs is what is exported at the end of the day hand those all to the the contractor and away he goes and then the context model would be really helpful for uh for rendering processing uh and then for me it's actually a design tool to figure out uh where my views are and the building orientation and lining up these buildings with each other so yeah let me fly you through the context model so this is a orthographic projection of the SketchUp model this is all SketchUp those are all uh surveyed Contours that we did end up getting we got lar survey from a drone on this project and uh it was pretty accurate so overlay this the civil engineering plans and then I have actually done a lot of the grading myself uh a lot of civil plans if you leave it up to them uh it might be a little bit rigid in terms of cut fill and uh the the landforms that are created so I like to smooth things out and I want uh I want the land and the buildings to have a seamless transition so here we are I have all the rock work modeled there that's just simple SketchUp sandbox tools took a little bit for it to process maybe four or five minutes and now I have a topography mesh that I can use throughout the whole life of the project also draped over all the the roads and the hydrology and then uh yeah there was quite a bit of grading involved with the contour lines and uh uh getting that right so you know kind of fine-tuning the grades around the buildings and a little tip uh probably most of the people in this room know but if you are doing architecture and you bring in some uh site work into your model it's going to make it look 10 times better context is everything so yeah Shadows tend to bog this thing down a little bit I'm sure you guys have all experienced that before and you know this is the phase where I'm about to drop it into twin motion or one of those other programs that can process a lot faster and uh smooth things out quite a bit but this is all Native SketchUp I would say love working in this way having kind of a SketchUp illustrative view like this is exciting to me and then the photo realism is the next layer of what comes so yeah all these buildings are lined up perfectly with each other so that's the Pavilion we're looking at Beyond uh through the Flyway it's like an aperture and then we're also CT capturing uh that rock outcropping Beyond and all these things have I was able to line it up straight as an arrow so every one of these buildings is uh within a degree of the highest point of these rockout croppings and again this is the shop looking out see a little bit of lag but yeah showing showing your clients this you know it just knocks their socks off they uh this is what they want to see and they they don't understand 2D construction documents a lot of them and it's really hard to visualize what it is that that they're looking at so this is a way to to to fly them through show them hey this is this is what your building is going to look like and man I've seen it done so many times before where that skep that step is missed and it's built and the client wants to change things because they don't like uh board form concrete and I was actually talking to a guy from Jade Mountain Builders Russ if you're here you know exactly what I'm talking about uh we were both on a project together in South Carolina and that's exactly what happened uh and man that was that was millions of dollars that could have been saved uh for this particular project just by visualizing it in 3D space let's see all right so that is my context model which brings me to my conclusion all right here here we are this is today actually we're a little bit beyond this but the owner uh is doing a bunch of site work he's done almost all the grading for the project he's laying out his irrigation field right now uh redoing all the all the plumbing for for irrigation these are drone views again here's that Rim there's the Moab Rim in the background this is that pond that he had just flooded and yeah it's exciting we're about to really break ground on this thing so yeah then final view you've seen that this is the site which brings me a Q&A and thank you I really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you guys um you're welcome to follow me my handle on Instagram is Sexton do or sex. studio so uh hope to see you there
