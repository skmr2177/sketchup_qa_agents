hey everyone my name is Eric sergeant and I want to welcome you to my 3D base camp recorded session of cities from scratch so the idea here is that we're creating contextual environments that will inform your projects so I'm going to goe and shrink myself down and we are going to dive right into it so a little bit about me uh my name again is Eric Sergeant you may know me from YouTube live stream with the SketchUp team you might also know my voice if not my face from SketchUp campus uh you might also know me from working on projects because part of what I do is do Urban Design and I'm an educator and I love mixing those two worlds together as you're going to see here in this presentation so I'm also a SketchUp evangelist so pretty much everything I do starts or ends in SketchUp for the most part I have spent the last 20 years migrating all kinds of different workflows into SketchUp so that basically it's the binder or the glue that holds all these different things that I'm able to do together it's kind of like a superpower that's why I'm here presenting for 3D base camp while I'm not in Las Vegas at the moment it's what this session was presented for and I get the honor or the uh the ability to do this again for you at home so for those that missed it um I'm also a city design nerd that's not really an official title it just means anything to do with cities uh streets sections analysis diagrams town planning traditional town plannings going and visiting Urban sketching I want to do all of it I want to know all of it I want to play with all of it um I just absolutely love everything to do with cities and City design and I call myself a want to be architectural illustrator I found that through uh my career the ability to be able to communicate design ideas was just as important if not sometimes more important than being able to design and solve problems by itself and so it's of learned and sort of taught some techniques and skills and tried things and see what works and again I call it wanabe because um I don't know maybe maybe someday I'll get there but this idea as it relates to this presentation it's really important because um as a designer and as an illustrator wherever you fall into the Spectrum this idea of bringing in contextual information to inform each part of that process is really important so I'm going to use it I'm going to show you today how I use it on several um in several aspects of the of the urban design process So speaking of what we're doing today uh we're going to start with a really quick primer on defining context that terms pretty broad obviously context can be anything um and so what I want to do is for the sake of this presentation just kind of tighten that up a little bit the next thing I want to do is go into the process overview so we'll look at now that we know what context is and why we it's important let's look at how we get it and specifically what context types there are so we're going to look at data sources and then of course the big thing is how do we get that into SketchUp especially if it's coming from a source where it's not traditionally meant to be brought into SketchUp and again we're going to touch on that and why um why I want to kind of break some of the rules in with this presentation and we're going to do this live now I'm doing this pre-recorded but I'm actually doing this live pre-recorded I did this live in Las Vegas in 3D base camp in the conference room so I'm going to do pretty much the same thing that I did with them we're going to do it live and I say it's risky because when you're working with City scale levels of data you know who knows what can go wrong but definitely uh nothing ventured nothing gained now in the live session we did do a Q&A um can't do a Q&A with you here but I would love to find out what you got out of the session I would love to find out what I missed if if you want to push back on what I'm proposing now if this is posted to YouTube there's going to be an opportunity to comment so I'm going to basically encourage you now feel free to throw out any questions or resource links or anything that I can do I will check those comments later and I will keep that conversation going there all right so defining context again for the sake of cities from scratch this being our theme I want to look at context at several different scales and how it can inform our projects to make better decisions and then do better communication about why we made the decisions that we made so I'm going to give you um just a really really high level overview here and when I think of context the first thing I think of is location it's location dependent so there's no way to have a real project for the most part without a location unless you're working on modular construction or maybe it's a theoretical thing um or you're testing something like um prefab prototypes for the most part almost all of our projects are located in the real world and then therefore defined or constrained by that particular ular location and I'll give you an example in real estate for those that know when you if you've bought a home or sold a home or heard a friend buy a home you probably heard this phrase location location location right because if you take two different houses and they might be exactly the same they could be um spec identical and put them in two different parts of town and they will be completely different price points it might be double and the reason why is because you have things like views traffic school districts is it walk or not are there trees or not is it shaded all kinds of things contribute to basically the value of your house based on its location so again this is just a really simplistic example of how two of the exact same product can be can have wildly different values literally based on which side of the Town they're located so again when I think of since I'm not in real estate I'm in Urban Design and I'm in education so I don't think of location location location like they do when they sell houses I think of context context context no matter what no matter what phase of the project I'm in I'm bringing this phrase in to the conversation even when I'm not asked to because it's just I think the right thing to do so again defining context a little bit further we've only got an hour together so we can only do so much together so I like to think of for me is to look at this idea of what I call bookending so book ending means that I put a lot of emphasis on the front end so where the context and why is it important before a project gets started so this analysis stuff um side analysis again um context analysis what's informing some of the decisions that are going to be driven during the middle phase which is why it's bigger it's the books because what most of us do is spend most of our time in this middle phase which is the design phase and so the design unfortunately well not unfortunately but for this conversation it varies so different scales and different projects different solutions different teams different budgets so we can't really touch on how context informs design so much because we're going to stay a little bit higher level but what we can do is come back that's why I call it book ending because we want to remember that context can be used in the front to inform our decisions and it can be used on the back to communicate them so whether that's analysis diagramming it's a hand sketch to show how the project will look in context when it's built out or could be again cutting sections there's all kinds of things we can do from the communication standpoint so that we are really clear and our clients and our team and whoever um the end user is really clear on why we made the decisions that we made and that's basically the value of this process is that really clear communication and ultimately it means I hope and in my experience it means quicker sign off they're with you and they're like yep I get it let's go so context scales we can go as Big And as far out as we want or we can go as micro tight and detailed as we want so I think of this is from the region all the way to the site and we want to explore pretty much everything in between today so an example of a project that I worked on that had a regional scale and again you might be saying why would you do this in SketchUp but we'll get to that maybe maybe you don't want to but I'm throwing the idea out there that you can and there's some value so stay with me this is a project that was in Downtown LA centrally located Transit oriented Community essentially and it was a proposal to basically say hey how is does this project kind of capitalize on its location as a Transit oriented community and what sort of values and then therefore decisions might we factor in to the planning process or the proposal process at this early early stage you can see in this case you count the Rail lines I'm not going to count them but you can count the counties 1 2 3 4 five counties transportation all runs basically within just a few blocks of this property so this is a story about Regional connection and you can tell that from this very simple diagram as we drill down to a little bit more detail we've sort of established that we're in Downtown LA so now let's look at downtown LA let's we're no longer we've gotten off the train for example we've got bike sheds walk sheds we've got transit station sort of the half mile what happens the what we might call a capture Zone and Metro stations landmarks again the landmark in this case being the river not necessarily being buildings because we're still at a very high high high level and as we get even closer now we're a little bit tighter we're in What's called the District what I call the district scale so you can see how it changes now we've got open space building Footprints uh you might bring in things like roadways or Road types um in this case building Footprints means that we can identify individual landmarks like significant buildings for example the Walt Disney Concert Hall might be kind of a good one to show where that is and again just kind of reinforce that that's within just a few blocks that's walkable and then the last site which is the site skill so this is sort of what I think of as the most detailed skill and often times the only skill when we look at a project we often are not asked to or not required to go beyond the site scale so I might have wanted to invert this and start with this but that's not how I told the story this is where I ended not where I began so in this case Angels null was a a former kind of just park open space that was being considered for redevelopment it's on a slope it's next to it has a transit station on its Corner again the transit story and now at this site specific scale we can see blocks frontages view corridors we can look at things like the slope um and and and bring in just again that richer level of detail that we wouldn't tell at a city level at a city scale because things like servicing and loading we don't tell that from a high level we tell that a site specific so again now I'm just tilting this so you can see from this example I'm looking at in plan view but you just Tilt The View and you can tell the same story from 3D again this is where I'm going now we have this choice we can go 2D or 3D and sketch up and in 3D it's really cool because all of a sudden what you have no idea what these building Heights are but you tilt and you realize that our site sits at the base of a slope but the base of essentially the block up is skyscrapers and it's near like the financial district and so how do we change how do we use this site to change the scale or how do we um transition from a lower to a higher all these things come into play when we bring in that 3D element and we would probably do that here at the site specific scale although we could zoom out a little bit if we wanted to so I'm going to give you really quickly another example not everyone's working on giant Transit oriented projects U Transit oriented developments uh in cities like downtown LA let's look at a smaller adaptive reuse this is a smaller residential project in a smaller City it's in Raphael and it was for a proposal again for a um mixed use apartment complex or condo complex excuse residential and so this is all in SketchUp all of it's in SketchUp all the data just went straight into SketchUp and the diagramming was done in SketchUp and layout with a little bit of tweaks in the in design but for the most part 90% of it was done in SketchUp and you can see that you've got the story here is it's very well located it's walkable it's right off the High Street um it's got all the things that you need to have a really to make this a really desirable residential location even though it's on the edge of a formally Warehouse District it's in transition so here again that diagram zooming in now we're sort of at the district level scale or that block scale and you can see the story that we were telling was where people are going from here to here to here they want to go from point A to point B how do we capitalize on that sort of path or that movement and um how does that inform the decisions for the programming and eventually the actual form so again this is using that same SketchUp model we just went in and just turned a tag on and off and now we can begin extruding but in this case we're not ready to extrude form we're at a really high level we're extruding ideas about what goes where so this idea of retail Cafe Market a poo where this parking go this is where we've already set the stage for why we make the decision that we're making and then we'll move we'll work with the architecture team and basically say this is you know what what we're going to do from a planning standpoint and now it's going to be our time um we'll move on and to give it form from there and lastly I won't go into that level of detail for this one but you can see this idea of replicability or repeatability so it might be a little bit difficult at first if you're figuring this out and you're converting files and you're layering stacking things but once you've done this one time you've you'll really quickly realize that oh I just need to do it that same way I'll just do it that same way and I can get the same result it's really cool um to put this hard of work in and and experiment and find something that works for you and your style and your projects and then as soon as you are happy and the client's happy I mean they like that last one so much we just literally just repeated it for another project and again they're in two different cities this is in Long Beach and that was in San Raphael so northern southern California and we just hey we're still a city we still need have all the same elements blocks landmarks um building Footprints Parcels all that stuff is still um we just are playing we just grab a different data set and then we can do the same process so speaking process let's go a little bit deeper I want to talk about the context types and then speaking data I want to talk about the sources and then speaking about sources let's put those sources together and call um in one place and this idea of using SketchUp as a source of truth it's not necessarily a source of truth but it's actually just it's bringing everything so that even if it's 2D or 3D we have it all in one place and I think there's value in that again because these are all coming this data is coming from all over the place so the data types specifically now not high level not the why is it important or or why how do we use it in the design process but basically what types of data and how why are we looking for them in particular what specific pieces of data so it's sort of a conceptual level starting from the ground up the ground plane is usually where we start because almost every site sits on the ground very few some float on water some float in the air I would say most of them start on the ground and by ground I mean the aerial which we're which we're all familiar with using as part of the contextual or analysis phase terrain mesh even projects that don't have a lot of terrain usually do have some slope and it's important to consider and then things like trrain Contours so again that's saying the same thing it's just depending on where the data is coming from sometimes you get a mesh sometimes you get Contours sometimes you have to create Contours from mesh the opposite so building up from there I think of we have our ground that's our existing site location now we're going to put some policy level stuff so policy stuff why do we need that it's to me I call this the invisible so the invisible are paral setbacks viewsheds easements um flood planes it could be a lot of things actually it depends on the municipality that you're working not every project needs these but I do think it's important to ask yourself the question as to whether or not you should bring them in for example Parcels you might just bring them in because it's a way to filter information because maybe building Footprints are too dense and maybe streets are too little so when you bring that parcel information it just allows you a little bit more flexibility as to the scale that you're going to use as your base map basically the base map is is the the deliverable that we're going to diagram on top of which is making the case for why we're doing what we're doing so I'm for the for our demo we're going to include some invisible data and lastly again I think this is where a lot of people start and stop is the built form it's the things that are actually existing they're there it's the things that we as people put for our needs Roads Transit bike paths building Footprints open space Parks right Creeks what or whatever um again dep ball fields it depends on it all again goes back to location location it's all going to depend on where we're working and what data sources might be available lastly and I put this last and I put it on the top is the site is that the site is not my primary consideration the site will be informed and that's what we're going to do is we're going to imagine what could be what could come or what might want to be there but we're going to do that last because we're going to make sure we have all the pieces that we need built up first and then our site a l lot of the answers will actually just come literally because they will be informed by the data we won't have to just come up with it and then justify it it will already be justified to some degree so I want to talk about the ground here before I move into the live demo I'm going to do this part here in slides um just because I have some stuff prepared but I want to talk about the ground first I also want to make sure that I shout out sketchup's ad location tool so this is where I think um when I did a lot of my process building and a lot of the methods that I've created again some of them are Legacy which means that ad location used to not allow you to tile big areas they can let you do that now um it used to have limits as far as the ter the resolution of the images again because the bigger the image you have in SketchUp the more it actually has less resolution and so now that you can tile it you can get a little bit higher quality so some of the new ad location features solve some of the issues that I used to deal with but I want to point out that we don't have to stop there just because it comes with our sub SketchUp subscription and it is a great resource in the first place you should start get drain imagery and mesh um geometry so definitely start with ad location it also geocat your model but let's not stop let's start there let's not stop there so I did this little comparison for a little while while back about the level of detail because I really wanted to understand well how how accurate is the mesh that's coming in from ad location and does it help and how helpful is it if it's not that accurate what can I do with it or what should I do with it so this is an example of Laguna Beach in Southern California where I lived at the time and I've got digital Globe here which is um what the ad location uses as its um terrain source and then I compared that at the time from NASA had what's called a shuttle mission which is where it scanned the Earth and this was from the year 2000 so now 24 years old so I put those two up next to each other and realized that oh wow digital Globes data sort of is on par with NASA's 24y old um shuttle mission and when I cut Contours through there you can see that it sort of reinforces it's very angular and Jagged because remember our terrain is triangulated so you're getting those really sharp kind of Corners because it's really just a grid of triangles ultimately at the end of the day so yes is it useful do you know where steep slopes are do you know where points are absolutely but is it that accurate No not really so what if I wanted to go bigger in two ways I always want to start with as much information as I can get as long as it doesn't Bo take too long to import or bog down my model because I think more is better usually so in this case when I say I want something I want the level of detail I want it bigger I want it in two ways I want a bigger area and I want it in more resolution so that's the goal and here's an example of using a height map and I'll show you um how to get a height map here in just a second it's only a 500x 500 pixel so really small height map almost like a thumbnail and you can see it generated over 19,000 Acres of high quality terrain right there in SketchUp in just a few minutes and I thought that was that's that's my process that's what I want to use this is what I need it's what's been missing again it's gotten better recently and using ad location but this this is what this is the kind of context that I want to make better decisions for my projects and you can see level of detail comparison go back and look at digital globe and now look at the heightmap method here um where after I cut those Contours and you can see so many little differences and I'll give you an example too we worked on a project where we had sort of a lower res terrain like the digital Globe one and that was um and then it turns out that we got got a new site survey done and the new survey was way more accurate and we had to redo the whole we basically redid the whole master plan and the reason why was because we were using sort of bad data to begin with and we probably shouldn't have done a master plan on it but that was just it was just kind of a test fit to see what we could do and the reality is is is is I mean if you had the difference between the two it will absolutely change how you would approach the design so where can you get it you can check out tangr height mapper it's great open source uh resource I used to have a a paid version um plugin that I would use for Photoshop in order to be able to get those and now I found this and I said yeah go do that now everyone can do that you don't need to buy that plugin so you grab a height map again scale it down don't go bigger than 500 by 500 Pro tip and then bring it in using a free extension called bitmap to mesh from TomTom thank you TomTom and then what you can do sorry I went the wrong way and what you can do is you can go it basically interpolates so white is up black is down it's a height map becomes terrain map so basically rastered pixels become terrain triangulated mesh or quad mesh I think it's triangulated and so you can see again white is high and black is low in this case it's up against the ocean so that should be um flat on that side and then there it is with the texture turned off and here it is with hidden geometry turned on so you can just see how dense that meshes now again you have to be careful because you don't want to bring more information than you need because more information could potentially slow things down but in this case it was totally manageable and you can just see the level of detail on that terrain mesh and you can see imagine now where the road would go and placing a building there or even just doing a sketch and being able to draw in some things and placing trees it just gives you a lot more information to work with so I love this process and I want to go and give you one more use case because I've got a few minutes before I switch to my live demo and this was another example where we had a project in Guatemala and I was brought on um but I wasn't I I wasn't able to go travel I think they had already traveled to the site and they said Eric can you come up with a concept plan for us and I said uh yeah but you not having been to the site it's really tough I mean I could tell from just looking at Google Maps this is a very hilly site and I said okay well that's fine I'll I'll use the process that I know I'll do the best that I can from not having been visited to the visiting the site so I took basically that height map of the entire Valley um everything from the site to the lakes to two volcanoes that are across the valley and I said cool because the lake and the volcanoes are really important part of what makes this site special I said well let's bring those into SketchUp and so that when I start making some decisions I can be thinking always where those are because I know there but I I want more than just knowing there's a volcano over there and so here in this case is height map bit map to mesh and then taking a um terrain um image and then just draping it over the top so now I have now I know basically where the roads are and I know where the natural features like things like parks and open space and of course where the volcanoes are so I was able to take the project site and I was able to line them up with my key sight lines and view corridors and then when you Tilt The View you can see that wherever I am on site whether that's at the entry or that's at the top or whether that's where the Town Center might go you can kind of always get a sense of where you are in um in relationship to this again this really special place up against up on this this Bluff and overlooking this Valley it's not enough just for me to know in for myself that this is the right thing to do I have to again remember there's analysis on the front end there's design and then there's communication so it was also important to me that I could communicate why I did what I did to both my team and then they would communicate maybe even possibly to the client group so using a if I move out of the way it's an extension it's from Fredo tools it's um which is free so Fredo was really awesome and developed added this uh slope analysis so you can see that 40 I did my 40 my 30 to 40 my 20 to 30° so this pink red area area that we really want want to kind of stay away from again now I could look at it and I could probably just say from experience ah stay off of this stay out of here but I wouldn't know exactly where and I wouldn't be able to do a great job showing somebody so doing that slope analysis in SketchUp with that highres terrain that I imported from the height map was super simple just took a few minutes well maybe took me a few hours playing around once I figured it out it only took a few minutes and then again I was able to use that as the base I used all that information that I had as a base to draw over I want to call your attention to just this little um darker green area because I felt from my analysis that this was a really special place and I thought this could potentially be something that we want to set aside and say that should be a park it should be Community amenity there's something I really think we should explore and understand better that could be a great opportunity and then through the course of the week after finally going down there and visiting the site and understanding it much better I was basically my my my armchair analysis was confirmed this Photograph was taken from that little null and that when I was on site that felt like it was definitely the most special spot and so it was it was really cool to be validated in a way that um it's really hard it's really hard to do it when you're not there and you're just reading the the the map and you're just kind of hoping for the best so that's an example again where being able to import such a big site and being able to run a slope analysis and being able to get the um mapping all the mapping layers all in alignment really I think created at least if not a better result it at least streamlined the process so that we could get to a better result and then here at the end of a week again it was a workshop so it was only we just had a few days it's why it's a pretty loose drawing at the end of a week we had um we had a concept master plan fairly well put together and then with the Hotel Site here um with um some community manity and Community parks and trails all kind of hugging that edge where we identified as a significant space maybe when putting a chapel like um a chapel or um an event guard an event lawn like right on that bluff so I'm going to pause there that kind of takes care of the ground plane but now what about all this other stuff okay so um so where it gets fun so where it gets challenging we're going to do this live together here what we're going to do is grab some data and what we're going to do is we're going to do a quick conversion so we do have to step outside of SketchUp for that and then we're going to bring that information into SketchUp and we're going to do style we're going to play with it a little bit so let me show you in SketchUp what I'm talking about so in SketchUp I have a model that's all of LA County if anyone knows LA County it's big it's 88 cities it's gigantic in fact the city of La itself is not even really one city you're it's Silver Lake it's Burbank it's all these um sorry all these neighborhoods are big enough to be small cities themselves so this little pink dot represents my site so I've got my city I've got my um cities my County boundary and my site going in a little bit more detailed we can bring in some Road information this just that Regional story sort of not not that Regional but more like that um that tighter story where it's like oh there's a freeway and there's a train station there's the river now all of a sudden it's like things are getting tighter we're getting a little bit closer we bring in that downtown story this gets a little bit more granular we can turn Parcels on or off if we wanted to like for example if I really wanted to let the aerial show through a little bit more I could turn the parcels on and off um we can also come in and play with things like roads and building Footprints so again like I said in the introduction we've got quite a bit of control about the level of detail we want to show even at this high high level or especially at this high level and as we get a little bit closer we might dump you know some of that surrounding context we sort of told the bigger story and we might just drill right in and say you know what let's just talk about what's happening just around the site itself and again throwing a Walk Circle in there just sort of reemphasizes um some of the things that sort of fall within that walkable Zone and then lastly all we have to do is just tilt the site if we wanted to I mean that's the same thing I mean this is it in 2D and we can wipe the colors out if we wanted to or we can bring the colors back and then all we have to do is just tilt that you can see if I tilt it like this it might look a little weird because I'm in 2D I can play with layering and then um but if I go to the 3D you know I might hide some of those layers so that I have just the 3D information and what's cool is if I wanted to I can get all the way down and even um start sketching over just coming up some with some really loose concepts for example you know like this is the Metro Station and and you've got the towers behind and so here we go just in one file I can go all the way from that Regional scale to the site specific scale so let's do that I'm going to open up a new blank one there I am and we're going to pause like I said we're going to jump out of SketchUp because we need some data first so let's pop over here to a another program now this is a free open-source geospatial app so GIS qgis the name of it you can see it works for Windows Mac and Linux it's something that I've used for a while because on Mac don't have the luxury of using arcgis and I think when you're working with things like students um sometimes you don't have the luxury of the budget that a big company um provides also the other thing too is I'm not a GIS Specialist or analysis I just need some couple pieces of data and that's it I just want something and I want to use it how I want to use it almost more like I'm a graphic designer and I want roads I'm not you know so just give me just a little bit so Q GIS is great for that so popping into qgis again I'm only going to show you maybe two I think three things in qgis that's all you need to know three things um because I don't know it very well and I don't need to so one thing we need is we need data so the first thing is we need to make sure that we get some data so for example you can go to a city's website and find like their a lot of cities are their they're more and more open with their data and some cities are better than others so I'm going to grab in La for example I'm going to grab what's called a county boundary and if you go look for their GIS data you'll get it in what's called a shape file so a shape file you just drag and drop it a shape file is basically a fancy way to say um a GIS file so you can see here's LA County that's the first thing you need to have you need to find a shape file and you can get it for free usually from public um municipality websites or you can send them an email just ask for it sometimes it's free but you just they don't make it available to download and then if you click on the boundary if you click on the in the the layer so you can see it says County here above my head and you don't have to do this but I like to just kind of change the simple fill to a simple line and the reason why is because it just helps me see the information better so I just kind of get rid of that fill and just knock it out so I click okay and you can see now I have just the bound and that's perfect so I'm going to do that same step again I'm just going to do that a few times and let's see for example I want to switch to cities so I grabbed the cities file you can see there it is it's slightly different color I'm not worried about the color being different I'm just worried about whether the fill is showing and if I don't want to show The Fill to show so for example let's just do this let's pretend like we want one big map here let's start simple let's start with this big story the county story in the city story so that's I showed you two things you need to know in qgis the third thing you need to know is just exporting to dxf I'm going to come up here I'm going to go file sorry project dxf export and I'm going to save it to my make sure I'm on my desktop we're going to call this County cities and Save and the only thing you want to do is you want to double check here where it says um actually it's not really important right now because I'm exporting everything but I'm going to point this out we're going to do this again and this is a feature this is a setting where it says export features intersecting the current map extent it's an important one to have checked because for example if we want to just get just downtown we maybe don't want every single building of the entire County might bog down our file right now we're okay because we only have a little bit of information so that's going to take a second should have only T taken a second so once that's exported let's go pop over here into SketchUp and I'm just going to drag uh that in and it's going to ask me a few options I'm going to make sure to choose preserve drawing origin and that way it will hopefully when I do this because I'm do this in multiple exports it'll remember so let's let that import shouldn't take very long again depends on your data set I'm going to click close And I'm going to hit parallel projection and one I'm looking in plan View and there we go we've got our cities and we have our County um so now let's go do this one more time I'm going to do this at a little bit of a tighter scale so now that we have our city I can drill into what I think is Downtown LA and we are going to pull in a little bit of more information we're going to go slightly um we're going to go we're going to focus more on like that downtown core so what will help us get there is prob starting with roads so roads you can see here if I sort of zoom out yeah that's probably more information than we need but if I kind of stay zoomed in pretty tight I can f I can see if I can get a Zone that's a little bit more um centralized to our area of study so let's go grab a couple more data sets that I downloaded I've got Parcels here so Parcels are property lines I don't have to again but I think I will just visually I like to just take out that simple fill and then go to simple line just makes it easier to see because it is Line work and then I think lastly for this demo I will grab building Footprints these are from 2008 so again this is an older data set that I downloaded you definitely want to make sure you've got the latest and greatest um because it may impact again your study so here I've got my building Footprints I can zoom in if I wanted to get something a little bit tighter a little bit more detailed I can zoom out again I can choose to toggle the information on and off depending on on um the scale that I want to do so what I would do is do the same thing I've already done this export so just to save time I just showed you how to do it once we're going to go dxf export save that and again you can export it all as one or if you want to be safe you can export them in multiple exports it just gives you a little bit more control when you go to import them into SketchUp so let's pop over to SketchUp here and zoom in and let's see if this worked I'm going to grab the roads DXs because I did export these as sort of separate entities just to kind of make sure that this demo goes smoothly and we're going to wait a second it's a lot of information but it shouldn't take too long it's thinking there we go close and it pulled me back but if I just kind of Zoom to my origin but if I zoom in you can see I have my roads there and they're placed within the context of the city which again the county boundary just it's just um I don't really need it at this point at this scale but that's okay so let's do that two more times I'm going to grab parcels and just click okay let it do its thing and you can see again it's a repeatable process once we've done this once we can do this multiple times we can do this with any data set we want we can do this with Transit stops we can do this with train lines we can do this with um again like special development districts overlay districts and then what I'm going to do here is is come let me move this so I can see what I'm doing and I can zoom in here and again now you can see we're at that high level scale county level City level um re sort of um highway freeway level and then we kind of come in to um in this case to the downtown core level and of course we can go in even tighter if we want to and just to kind of show you where that information if you wanted to you don't have to but if we wanted to just kind of see which is on which tag I'm going to change some colors here real quick I'm going to see if this works because you never know sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't sometimes it cooperates I'm just going to kind of change the colors a little bit and I think if I set this by color by tag and open up my Styles and then come down to buy material um and then add a new style you can see here that um everything that's green is a building footprint everything that's blue is a parcel again now I get to kind of play with that information so I could just use I don't even have to go to photoshop or illustrator or in design I can just literally play with uh these colors the parcels for example I might want like really light gray um so they're faded the roads maybe something like um I don't know maybe I want to pop those or emphasize those let me see here there we go some reason I need to refresh that so you can see stylistically I can start to um I can start to play with this information and get it to pop the way that I want it so that's cool so that's kind of um that kind of takes care of that invisible layer this is the 2D now I know we're in SketchUp and so it doesn't really help us because if I tilt you know it's still in two Dimension um but let's take it a little bit further let's go to let's add that last layer let's add that site specific layer in 3D because we don't really need to study the entire downtown core in 3D it just doesn't help us it's too much information again we want just the right of am of information depending on the scale of our analysis so I want to go in and kind of look at this like downtown almost like block level scale again I'm going to pop out of SketchUp for just a second because it's all about data we need to get the data and we need to bring it in and everything comes in to SketchUp no matter where it came from I'm going to pop over here to my web browser I've talked about qgis we're going to set qgis aside for a second um also talked about tangr the height mapper again so kind of done with the terrain I want to look at building Footprints so where the best source of that is open data we can go to open street maps but it requires a little bit more work there's a resource here that I've plugged in some of my videos for SketchUp in the past it's called cadmapper so if you're have an account you can log in and basically just says where do you want to go Los Angeles if I can type that in correctly and spell it correctly and you can see it already pulls me pretty close to where I want to be it takes me to downtown um City Hall our project is right there it's right here this green space this park it's called Angels null so let's kind of zoom out maybe a little bit from there and you can see it can give you AutoCAD so again we can get still 2D information from cadmapper but I want the SketchUp because I want the buildings we can get the topography or we can ignore the topography now the site is on a slope so I'm going to grab the topography again even if I don't use it I might use it from ad location but then I have two sources of topography I can kind of choose what works best so there's kind of a reason why in this case I'm going to bring it in and then I can always change my mind sometimes I'll do two exports one with topography one without and then I can just kind of put them on tags and toggle on and off um 10 meters for a m a minor road I don't know that might be a little high let's go with something like eight it's downtown major roads 20 meters yeah let's go with um like 18 bring that down a little bit maybe 15 okay and then what we're going to do is it asks you to select the area so in this case what I do do is Click once and drag and you can see what it's doing is it's telling me how much I get here for free you can go up to a Kil a square kilometer so it's a little bit challenging because in this case um um for me I'm probably okay I wish you could rotate the grid because sometimes I can get more area if I could rotate to the grid you can you know what I mean right now there's like these Corners are a little bit inefficient but whatever that's you know maybe in a future um in a future project so what I'm going to do is just click that again is a new you can see if I go too big it'll tell me it'll yell at me and say okay it's going to cost you this much so let's keep this free for right now and say that's great I'm going to go ahead and create that file what it's going to do is it's going to preview it for you so it gives you all the information before you download and this is nice because not every again area has the same data set so for example if I work in a city like in the middle of nowhere they may not have this information um and it also changes over time so here we go I've got Parks I've got roads I've got buildings I've got all the stuff I need to kind of continue my analysis and this looks good to me so I'm going to download this I have this downloaded again I'm going to go find it in my files I'm going to pop back over here to sketch up I have a file here that I just kind of already um let's see I think it's this one let me open that up you can see so what it does is it gives you again it gives you um buildings if I tilt it it does not give you that Walk Circle um you can see it's on topography so the roads are I did import the topography and so you can see that it um if I turn that on change maybe the let's see here you can see there it is I don't have a um color on it because I like actually it being white but if I turn my hidden geometry on you can see my Topography is there my buildings are there it's all that information is there my parks are there if I turn my topography off you can see I have my site it's kind of it's a hole because if you look at it in plan view I want to be able to see that so that's cool what I would do here is just basically make sure all of the things that I want if I want the topography um I may have to unlock that's a location snapshot yeah let's just leave the topography off right now I'm going to group everything I'm going to copy it I'm going to come over here and I am going to place this I'm going to paste it in place got a scale bust that's my fault um when I imported excuse me when I imported my cat information I didn't check the scale and so when I measured it I was like oh look that looks right but no that's not right um this is why you rehearse many many many many times so this is not what I would do instead what I would do excuse me I would repport but you can see for sake of time I'm just going to go ahead and scale this down and you can see now if I turn my color by tag off I have again if I turn the camera angle off I have another piece of information I have my 3D piece of information that I can just kind of drop in where it belongs and again if depending on how you use this the way I set up the demo in the beginning is that we can float some of the information above so for example if you have 2D on a flat plane and you have your 3D on terrain well we can just always lift the parcels above because again Parcels don't exist it's part of the invisible layer so if I don't need to see the parcels in a 3D view um then I can just again if I'm only using it in the plan View and SketchUp just you can stack and layer them however you want so here set the camera to parallel projective projection go to layer one and then drill down into as much or as little detail as you want so I'm going to pause there because again I think we could do a lot from here now have information we can cut sections we can run slope analysis Shadow studies we can um again put our walk circles or even maybe do a view shed view cones there a lot of stuff we can do once we have this level of information and you can see that this was all free it all came from open source data and it all just took a moment to translate before it went into SketchUp and then was stacked on top and if I didn't do that scale mistake when I imported the dxf everything would have dropped right into place and I wouldn't feel quite so stupid because I have done this a million times and I know exactly how to do it and I missed that step um but at the same time it does go to show you that U once you've done it and you know the process then you're you're you know what to look out for you know not to make that mistake because you saw me do it so what I'm going to do is pop over here to wrap up done with cadmapper done with ugis and I just want to pop right here for an ending slide I want to kind of leave off where we started which is this idea that whether you are doing analysis on a front end to inform the design the bookend process or whether you're going to use it for something like diagramming or um a rendering in which case you want to visualize your site in context so the Design's already been done and now you want to show how it's going to look and how it's going to fit in sort of to over to the neighborhood to the district um now we have that ability again we just toggle that information on and off we can zoom in and out we can go big or we can go small depending on the scale that's important to us we can go 2D we can go 3D we have this ability in just one model with just a little bit of thought and just a little bit of data Gathering we can now do pretty much anything we want and that's really the story that I want to leave you with that's the message I want to leave you with the power of bringing all this stuff into SketchUp and centralizing it so that no matter what you need it for it's there at your fingertips when you're ready so I'm going to pause there I'm actually going to stop there I'm going to see if I have a thank you slide I do got an email feel free to use it you can find me on the SketchUp Community that's um Eric s you can also check out some of my previous work at learn. sketchup.com which is SketchUp campus if you want to learn more about your skills and I'm going to say thank you for joining me for letting me share some of my tips with you and if I missed you um if you're watching this recorded and I couldn't catch you at Bas Camp live well hopefully there'll be a base camp in two years and we'll catch you then thank you see you soon
