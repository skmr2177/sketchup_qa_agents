welcome to everything you need to know you learned in architecture school rethinking the tools of the trade I'm going to try to help you think a little bit differently about architecture to start my name is Brenda ski I'm a registered architect and I'm the owner of b square Design Studio I don't know if anyone has heard of that but it is in rural Central Michigan so if you read the Michigan map we're like right there in the middle of the state um it's a small farming Community about 12200 people and not where you really U not where I ever thought I'd be starting my own Architecture Firm so what I want to do to start is talk a little bit about architecture school just reflect a little bit on what might make architecture school a little bit peculiar when I was in school I remember being a designed a project to design a space for the cook in the canterberry tales uh choser canterberry Tales so I had to I'd never read that before I didn't know anything about this um work and so I had to read it understand it understand the cook's place in the whole story and then design a space for the cook um another project we had we had to roll some dice and that was back in the day when we had newspapers and so we'd have to um count the dice and count down lines of newspaper and choose some um part of an article to base a design around and so a lot of heads scratching projects um is what I remember architecture school for but it did help us learn how to think and how to take abstract information and translate it so I I'm building this talk on that on that type of thinking we also worked on um cardboard models and little study models and so we'd used Basswood and chipboard and any kind of modeling scraps and we'd build using that and I for one loved model building I loved thinking about that cook and Cher and or in kinderberry Tales and trying to figure out what kind of space I would design for that problem to solve that problem and so I personally really enjoyed that part of it but if you're not necessarily trained in handb building anymore in architecture school you're still thinking about abstract issues or abstract questions translating those into three-dimensional space and then also documenting them in two-dimensional design or two-dimensional drawings so you're thinking back and forth between a 3D space a 2d drawing to document it and then back to that 3D space so that type of thinking is still what we're doing as Architects and thinking about that abstraction is the basis for what we are trained to do I'm wondering how often budget or cost to build was a priority in your architecture Studio classes in my case we never talked about the budget or the cost to build except maybe oh very rarely very abstractly because as we all know as soon as we start to budget or cost we tend to lose the creativity and and we were in studio class to learn to be more creative and so budget was kind of a we weren't worried about how much it was going to cost to build the Cook's house I also wonder how many Architects go into architecture because of the easy money or the good quality of life it doesn't typically um translate into those we knew that back in school and kids I got this uh image off of Tik Tok kids today are still asking why do people think Architects make money it's not really a great way to make a huge uh financial gain and and it's always very intense it's intense in school it's intense out of school the one thing I did notice too is when I got out of school most Architects live in urban areas because there's opportunities for work and networking and collaboration and the money is more abundant uh as well which just to be honest and so when you're living in a more rural community um or you want to not live in an urban area it can be very restrictive uh when you're wanting to also practice architecture in the current way that we are practicing so I want to talk a little bit about the disconnect between the school and the profession um for architecture school again we're trying to figure out what to build the whole intention is to work on your output which is most often 3D or related to 3D and it's intended to describe an idea or what to build I'm sorry I'm struggling with a cold in in the profession of architecture then we're really spending our time documenting how to build the documents we produce are large drawing sets specifications data sets and they're intended to describe how the project will be built and to minimize liability so in school the main audience for our work were professors guest critics other professionals that could help us refine our ideas and learn how to describe them better at work the main audience for our deliverables or our drawings are usually builders contractors Consultants Subs building officials these are the people that we're really working to communicate with and so I believe our understanding of what we were learning to do in school was to communicate to professionals and both of those audience understand for the most part how to read two-dimensional architectural drawings and think about those as three-dimensional constructions neither group is the client or the end user so what I want to do is think about the tools that we learn this is what I do do in my practice use the tools that I learned in architecture school but I use those tools more to communicate with the client I put the client in the center of that so what I'm going to talk about in this talk are some of the challenges in providing full service architecture for typical single family homes I'm going to talk about how to build for design using SketchUp deliverables so I'll go through the four parts of a project that I use I'm going to talk about um some sample schematic design projects and the proposal and then how I think about construction phase services so for the challenges um currently it's not necessary or required to hire an architect in Michigan for a residential home with a habitable space of less than 30 500 square fet this is fairly common around the country um I went to a custom residential conference after I started doing this work and found out everyone was doing much larger homes than I am much more expensive and and the homes that do require an architect to work on them uh meanwhile according to the US Census Bureau the average square footage of a newly built single family home in the United States is this is in 2022 about 2,300 square feet and I will say the average in the area where I live is under 2,000 square feet um so I live in an area that's below average kind of in every situation that would be make it feasible to have an architecture practice so just keep that in mind um so let's look at the state of residential architecture design in Michigan so what I see and what I've been seeing for the past um about 12 years that I've been doing this is um we have homes like this this is a a home that we're working on right now um we have a lot of older homes in our country they require significant repair to bring them up to current codes and living standards and so they're not habitable but there's some good qualities to them and I believe we have such an AG in residential infrastructure in our country which is contributing to the housing crisis that we're currently having and so what I'm proposing as a solution to help with that we also have homes like these that are currently being lived in but they are older I've got the mid-century home the mid-century style Ranch which is more mid-century flavored than a full mid-century style house and then um the other house is more of a traditional house built around the 1930s and what happens with these again these are a very much a typical type of client I would work with um what happens over time is those houses need updates and so in the case of the mid-century modern the homeowner decided um they wanted a primary Suite added to the house and then they wanted a sunspace added to the house so you can see those right here and um this one here they needed more kchen space so they added a kitchen and I'm not sure if you can tell you can see the problems contractors will add these things to help people because people have a need and they have a request and they are not in a position to be able to truly look at the house holistically make sure that the work that they're adding fits the style and the the form of the house and also um doesn't create future weather related issues you can see in both of these the additions create Valley that in a cold climate like we live in um they cause problems later on so they may solve a problem in the short term cause more problems later and when a new homeowner purchases the house like in the case of the mid-century modern the new owners wanted that mid-century style but the whole back of their house is a completely different style so we end up with these Franken houses that happen over time I also work with new with clients building new homes and new construction and these are the types of drawings they typically bring me and I will just say most most clients do not want a machine for living they don't want the most Cutting Edge architecture that I could possibly provide they bought the land in the neighborhood that they're in or purchased it wherever they are that wherever they're building for a reason because they like the character of that neighborhood or that area and most people don't want to build something that sticks out like a sore thumb they want to keep their maintain their home value and have something that looks like their neighbors houses only maybe a little bit better um homeowners love Pinterest and HGTV and they have big dreams but they're not necessarily in line with what we were encouraged to work on in architecture school not really pushing the envelope Builders can manage the code and life safety requirements necessary to build single family homes and they do that's um that's how most homes are getting done and they can also guide material selection project budget and construction methods so I've heard different figures but it's over 90% of American homes and especially renovation and remodel projects are being taken care of directly through Builders and I I see an opportunity there there's a big gap in what home owners are able to access in terms of design and so we looked at this um curve in the keynote on the first day and I'd never seen this but it made a ton of sense so you can do the most you have the most impact on a project as an architect in the predesign schematic design design development phases as the project goes along it's harder to have impact on how the project comes out versus t uh cost over here in pre-design the cost isn't much to make changes or to make suggestions as you go through the project changes cost more and more and more to make and when homeowners are working directly with Builders to get their houses done Builders tend to jump in right around here around design development construction documents this is where they're working for the most part because it there's no um benefit to them to work heavily in this part so this is the area where I see a lot of opportunity for Architects to assist homeowners in the pre-design schematic design and design development phases the problem is it's difficult to prove or quantify the value of hiring a professional because design is is so um difficult again to quantify versus I'll uh for example we can prove that it's um that we need a contractor we can prove this part right here because it's construction documents and construction phase Services people are seeing that thick set of drawings and they're seeing um something actually built in the pre-design phase research it's hard to it's difficult to show research design thinking options those types of things very diff ult to describe to a client and so this is the area where I think Architects can really really help because of this situation Architects are excluded from the single family home building process and so I feel like we've underestimated the value of our training and so this again is that that unmet need um we understand space planning and we can handle multi-dimensional design we can handle it if one person in a couple wants something cozy and small and charming and another person in the couple want something spacious and big and with large windows and connected to the outdoors we can kind of help to manage those requests into a way that fits the entire family um we can evaluate site conditions we understand how the site works with a structure and I see this all the time um one of my close friends has a home that was built on a beautiful site it was built prior to her buying it but built on this site gorgeous views up a river and the best view in her house is from her primary bathroom because the house wasn't sighted properly and so we can think about where is the Sun going to be where is the breeze going to be if we're thinking about sustainability we can think about efficiency can you build smaller can you build less and still get the function that you need uh and long-term value if clients are considering selling the house at some point how are the changes they're making going to hold value and respect the original house we can celebrate The Human Experience and culture um even just small unusual parameters I had a client who wanted a house with a slamming screen door he wanted to kind of capture the feelings he had going to his own grandparents house and and so he that was a big part of the design brief was just to have a cool screen porch with a noisy slamming screen door so those types of details are the things that make a design special to clients and that's something The Architects are well suited to address and just keep in mind some clients can be just as complex as Cher or as random as rolling Dice and so that skill set if you enjoyed that skill set in school is is really really well suited to working with homeowners so I'm going to talk through how to build a residential architecture practice because they don't really exist for smallscale homes there's got to be a reason so I'm going to talk about how I've uh kind of managed that and it's I can do it anywhere again if I'm doing it in central Michigan this can be done anywhere um it's through SketchUp through SketchUp and layout they are ideal tools for transform in the design process that we use in school into a practice that's flexible sustainable and most of all financially feasible so this is actually possible to do to use the part in school that we liked but to use it to build a business around and so we all know anyone who's used SketchUp or talks to people who use SketchUp most people use it for the early phases of a project so it's perfect to apply to homes by prioritizing and billing for design and planning um we are able to effectively design midsize homes within an affordable budget in a way that maximizes the value to the client so the client can see what they got for that investment in design and planning so I'm going to talk through how my process works I have four phases of every schematic design project so all of my projects have some amount of all four of these phases so I've got predesigned study and document prep I'll talk through that I've got schematic design so I'm going to go through what that means to me I've got material and finish and then drawings and deliverables and so I I let my clients know when we start each phase of the process is billable and will have its own separate budget and each phase is part of every schematic design process or project we can't skip any one of these phases for 95% of my projects and then also each phase is linked to a SketchUp deliverable so people can see the value of what they're getting within each phase the key to our process lies in having a high volume of projects and a rapid project turn around so we tend to work on by myself and I have a part-time designer that works with me we do between 40 and 50 projects a year and that's really only because I'm destructible and I like to travel and and I don't work 60 hour weeks anymore I want to work a more normal schedule and have some quality of life we could we could do more if I didn't want to come to base camp and and have fun and things like that so my life is more important and more flexible we're still able to accomplish that level of work each year and with SketchUp and layout we can efficiently generate and document multiple design Solutions so we can be working on a bathroom remodel and a small commercial project or a whole house remodel or a new house all of those things can be going on at the same time and we're able to manage it using the SketchUp and layout uh process we've developed so I'm going to talk through all four of these design phases using two examples I'm going to show you a home uh renovation project in interior renovation project and I'm going to show you a new home designed keeping in mind every single project we do ends up finishing a little bit differently it's just like uh design school it's just like architecture school so um first part the first thing we do is predesign study and document prep and so this is tied to several SketchUp um deliverables we set a budget of time for each phase so I will set a budget of time for this predesign phase part of the predesign phase is an initial meeting with the client I usually spend between an hour to two hours asking a ton of questions like not only how many bedrooms how many bathrooms but do you entertain often um do you want to spend time Outdoors what hobbies do you have who does the cooking do you want your closet attached to your bathroom all kinds of things and so I ask a lot of different questions this lets me know about how long it's going to take me to do each phase can I can bid it pretty well now so I'll set a minimum number of hours I think it's going to take for each phase and a maximum and so the client knows I have an hourly rate for that part it's going to cost at least this much it could cost as much as this much but for the pre-design phase we've got that pretty well worked out we know about how long that takes all the time and So within that phase we can generate a pre-design report this is the coolest thing I just got a project um uh someone accepted the proposal they let me know that this week and so I was able to quickly while we were here turn around and generate a pre-design report based on their building site it's an old house an old farmhouse and it took me longer to figure out the exact address than it did to generate the report and so then I can send that off to the homeowner buys me a little bit of time and gives them something tangible that they're getting for their fee um the main piece that we do is a study model that's geolocated on the site so I'll show you an example of that when we're doing a new home if the client doesn't have a floor plan they want us to build to start with we'll start with a Jello cubes massing model so I'll show you what that looks like so for examples in my renovation process this is a typical pre-designed study model so it looks like school it looks exactly like school only way way better it's on um a geolocated uh site so we can turn on Shadows turn things off but it's really simplified so I don't show any um detail I am just working with the um basics of the house so I'm working with shapes and forms just like school and openings and so inside I can see the um interior spaces and the point of these models the absolute CR critical part of these models is they're very easy to edit I can take these walls off take these walls put these walls on um this client here didn't like those walls in the middle so I can take those out pretty easily just by switching them to a tag so everything is grouped and it's extremely easy to edit that's the key for a New Home Project we typically start again if we don't have um a drawing to start with this is how we'll start that so I've got I brought in a contour model of this site because I knew there was a pretty significant slope here and they're going to be on a river here's the road to the house and what we do is we start with a set of Jell-O cubes so it's basically a live bubble diagram that we can use to work out adjacencies but what's so helpful is the fact that we can do this on an image of the building site because when you're on a river this is just like my friend's house when you're on a river the best view isn't straight across the best view is up the river and Down the River that's where you really get the most most water view so we can pick up these jell cubes and sit down with the client and ask all right living room we're just using that those Furniture pieces as an icon so that people recognize it it's basically a label we can say do you want the living room on the roadside do you want the living room out here do you want to look down the river do you want to look the river we can just move these around and ask a whole bunch of questions so that the client has a chance to participate and clients love this back to here um this is kind of where we end up on a pre-designed study with an existing house and so what's super cool about these is people see this every day they know what this looks like or they see this ugly trim on here outdated maybe it's not ugly but it might fit in right here at the Venetian but um it is really delightful for clients to see their house brought out of its current situation and into a form that it's clean it's clear and it's easy to work with so just this simple SketchUp model that's not impressive to those of us who work with SketchUp makes a client really really happy and I can adjust my budget based on what I know we're dealing with for predesign so for that Farmhouse it's a ways away I'm going to have to spend some time getting there and then measuring that house and building that model so I can adjust that fee versus this house here it might be closer and it's a smaller house and I know I can build that pretty quickly so I can budget for whatever the client's needs are all right real time schematic design this is kind of the main feature of the process this is exactly what it says it's real time so we can design with clients just like you do in a desk review at school and so we'll have interactive design meetings and move things around in the model because they're so easy to edit we will set up multiple design Solutions and tests so a client may ask for one thing but I may see a better idea I've got time built in so that I can make suggestions and people welcome that they want to know what do you think what can we do a lot of times I come up with stuff they never would have thought of whether it's a good idea or not is up to them but I'm able to voice what I think might be a better design um and then after each meeting we'll set up printable meeting notes using layout so we can send the client documentation after every meeting of where we're at with the floor plan and what's going on with the design so for this phase because it's so wide open to options it's got a much heftier top budget so I know after meeting with the client I know how close they are to reality so I can bid that lower number to a place where I know I can get it done I can do a sufficient schematic study for that then I have a ton of extra time in there because some clients want to see lots of solutions so I have um I had a client working on a kitchen and she would check out books from the library she just really wanted to do it and she liked everything so she check out books do some SK send me her sketches I'd build the model she'd check out more books I think she got a design education just working on her kitchen and eventually we got to the top of her budget for this phase and so at that point we can have a conversation I could say look we're at the top of your budget what do you want to do in her case she wanted to switch to hourly because she wanted to keep working so we ended up going way over that budget but she was aware of why and was seeing the value of the process so what we're going to end up with with this is um a uh schematic meeting and so with this client here what she told me when we had a meeting was um it's an older couple they are Michigan snowbirds so they spend time south in the winter um but when they use this house it's right on a CER sack they like the neighborhood a lot and so the neighbors hang out out here on the South Side on the culde out where all the sunlight is so when she called me her main issues I'm sorry and the problems that she stated she was hoping if she just replace her kitchen with some brighter cabinets she might be able to brighten up this part of the house she also didn't like these walls in the middle like I mentioned and she had an issue because uh she liked to hang out here on the sunny side in this um living room area her husband would sit back here and watch TV this was usually his spot and she felt like it was messy you could see I don't know if it was socks or I'm not sure what bothered her but she didn't like seeing the mess back here in the corner so that was uncovered during the interview but then I asked a few more questions and it comes out these bedrooms especially this this one are too small and this bathroom is not conducive to aging nor is the front entry so those are some bigger issues that are going to impact their ability to stay in the house long term with the new house schematic that bubble diagram turns into again a very schematic space planning model where we can see forms and shapes and um start to sketch in how that design will work and for the client they can see all right I've got my kitchen island facing this way maybe I want the kitchen island facing sorry can't find my tools maybe I want the kitchen island facing the lake oh now I see that's gonna impact I can't get past the stove or it's going to get into my living room I'm gonna have to redesign other things this is where if clients want to see every option I've got the budget to do that but they can also see I don't have to say if this client says hey can you flip the island to face the river or so the long part is parallel to the river I don't have to say no that doesn't work all I do is show it and a client says oh yeah I don't like that so it allows me to not be negative about every suggestion they make the model proves why to do it or why not and people have really good ideas sometimes I don't think something will work and it actually does so it's a it's a nice way for everybody to work uh I will show them we're standing in the kitchen right now I love to do a kitchen view you know we're standing at the kitchen island I just put in holes just like school I'll put in a hole this there would be windows in here I don't know how big they are right now I'm not worried about that I am just looking at how the space works all right okay and what happens what's really really cool about this and working this way is as we work together and we collaborate we can see opportunities and we can see ideas so this is a um second floor of a little kind of a cottage we were doing for an older couple who were planning space on the second floor for their own children and grandchildren so the second floor is supposed to be for the grandkids and the family and the first floor is for the couple and the way they talked about the house and what was important to them they wanted it to feel like going to visit a kind of a fairy tale Cottage and I knew talking to them because they were budget sensitive they weren't going to be able to afford a lot of the finishes that they were describing and things that would really build that charm in based on finish but we saw a space between the two guest rooms and thought you know what we could capture that space and create a little playroom space here between the two bedrooms they could store toys in there and then the kids could have a little fairy tale window built in that would allow them to kind of call down to grandma or whatever this was very exciting for the client and this is all we needed to do and I wouldn't have ever thought to do that and the client wouldn't have even thought to ask for it unless we were working together on the model and we could see some opportunities and I could make some suggestions sorry I did not realize still my PowerPoint there we go so um the third part of our process is material and finish so we can't leave it looking like that white box for a contractor that looks a little weird to a contractor so I let homeowners know I need to do a minimum amount of finish so I'll do a little bit of schematic exterior finish I'll add some windows some roof profiles and a little bit of sighting just to bring it out of that SketchUp look and more into a re more into reality but sometimes people want special design features the two projects I'm showing you both wanted a little bit more in terms of material and finish so I typically bid this phase I need to do this amount to make it look okay when I publish my construction set um from my schematic set but we have lots and lots of time so I can sketch in other things that you want to see before we close out so this is basically the client's budget to work with I will also again send out printable meeting notes after each each meeting and a sample of what those look like is like this so at the end of each meeting I'll just send them here's where we're at and that way people can sketch they can think they can mentally move in and talk about it how is how's everything going to work for them and make sure that they're happy with the design so moving into here on the renovation project um let's go to the exterior this is option three so we ended up doing three op options within schematic design and for material and finish I did three options and so this is the third option little paint little bit of detail second option white paint instead of a color and this is what the client asked for in the first place so she said can we take the shutters off can we update the exterior in a minimal way that will still make it look better so all I did was take the shutters off set up the design of the house and then I added a little deck so instead of adding just a ramp I thought you could incorporate a ramp into a deck that you could use when you're hanging out outside with your friends then you have a space to sit but it can also be built out to get you from one level to another now in this plan this is again what she initially asked for she said can I replace my kitchen cabinets make them brighter to make the the kitchen brighter and I also want to get rid of those middle walls well what Happ happens is you can see it if we get rid of those middle walls we can make the kitchen bigger but all of a sudden you can see straight through here and so um what we do is we always design with Furniture in place because it helps clients to see scale but it also helps us to Think Through focal points and how where's the headboard going to go and where's the TV going to be and things like that so we always design with Furniture in place and then we can put people right in there so she can see oh I like this part it'll be nice with my friend walk in the house this looks really nice as soon as my friends sit down oh my gosh we can see all the way back to where my husband hangs out and then I have to worry about the mess so this tells her what she initially asked me for doesn't actually work so then that opens up opportunities for us to find some other Solutions and we have the budget to be able to do that for the new house design let me pop outside here this is where we typically typically leave off with material and finish on a new house again this one has a little bit of extra but for the most part we add roof profiles simple Windows and um that's about it and then in this one they wanted some ceiling details they wanted some decorative beams on the ceiling they also wanted kind of a coffered ceiling in the kitchen which I knew was going to add cost so anything that I know is going to be built in that's not not finishes but actually built-in that may add cost I will sketch that in so a builder is aware of it and can price accordingly um and then we can stand back at the island and see okay here's how the windows work I can see out there I can see the TV I can see everyone hanging out um if they have a special detail they want like we want to build in a antique window between the entryway and the dining room we can show that so A builder is clear this is something they want and and then for finishes this is where we leave off most of our models leave off at this level so we've got the major parts located under know where the fridge is where the range is where the sink is whether or not it's plastic laminate or fantastic marble that I'm going to leave up to the Builder and the homeowner because that's what makes or breaks your pricing and so I don't I don't promise any of that I under promise in terms of finish and I under deliver in terms to finish because I don't want the finished house to not look as good as the photo realistic rendering that I produced so I stay away from all of that and give people an idea of what they're getting with for a very specific purpose and I'll show you that one when we leave off this is where we left off with this house homeowners really happy the windows are all the way they want it um everything looks good to them and that's what I'll tell people if it looks good in this form if you're happy with it in this form it is going to look fantastic when you actually add finishes and so even for the more modest homes once they have finishes and they're not the SketchUp model anymore people are super happy so I tend to stay away from heavy rendering unless we have to do it and keep things in that realm of possibility because that's where people are happier the fourth phase that we work on is drawings and deliverables so this is where we actually produce our final um our final description of the design process and so the deliverables phase is really variable depending on what we do sometimes what we'll do is we always set up schematic construction sets but um sometimes we'll have options because people we may have an idea that someone could live with and it's okay but this would be so much better but we know it's going to be more expensive and so this way they can get pricing on those two things because sometimes the thing that's more expensive adds so much more value that it's not really that much more expensive to do what they want um so that's part of our drawing process I'll show you that um we can also do renderings video walkthroughs you all know how easy that is to do um and one other thing about this deliverable phace will'll detail our schematic construction set depending on how the homeowner is planning to proceed with construction so I work I have worked with several contractors on their own homes which that to me is such a compliment and um I've had to really work hard to earn that but the reason they work with me is because I can help them talk with their wife because their wife doesn't trust them anymore to do what she wants or that she'll be happy and so I know when I'm working with a contractor I don't have to put as much information on the drawings because they know exactly what to do they just need to make sure their wife is on the same page so in that case I bill less for the deliverables because I don't have to do as much work versus someone who's taking it out to a contractor then I need to make sure everything is properly noted the other thing we can provide are these nscap 3D viewer QR codes people absolutely love these it's so much fun just to have these codes on their drawing sets because then they can show it off to their friends look at what our space is going to look like and again this is a higher level of finish than we normally show but it was a more finish based project so let's look at how these books look for the renovation project um we put together we call them playbooks so I don't call them blueprints I don't call them construction drawings I call it a Playbook it's like a set of plays to coach a homeowner through their project and so with this little renovation project this home owner um the first thing I sent was existing model views and so these drawings they get right away they can see here's my house on the site there's my Goldis stack here's what the house looks like right now and I don't know which direction they're going to go with it floor plans so the client can the client can sketch the client can play the client Can Dream 3D views and then with this one we ended up developing three op options so the playbooks a little bit longer I'm able to use that extra budget I have to fully document three different options however SketchUp makes it really really easy to um set up the viewports and set up the models so that we can flip between options really easily so option one again minimal work this is what she originally asked for ex your reviews we always document what needs to come out of an existing house by using the color by tag feature and so in this option we're doing minimal work we're just taking out the kitchen those walls she doesn't like and that's all but I tell clients wherever they see orange there's going to be dollars so the more orange the more dollars that they can kind of track costs abstractly that way uh a floor plan View and then a 3D View and we also will um use color by tag to Note new work so the Builder can see this is what's going in new and what came out and the homeowner can see okay I'm adding this much there's going to be cost involved this also documents the fact that it doesn't solve the problem of being able to see through between the two rooms so we've got 3D view here with some furniture shown and some interior views so the homeowner can see how this works because of that problem I had recommended option three which I'll get to in a minute after option three homeowner wanted to see option two so she had some ideas so these are kind of more her ideas um so option two we paint the brick other than that it's pretty much the same as option one um but we do a little bit more demo work so you can see we take out more of the space take out that bathroom and remodel it so that it could be bigger and make this bedroom bigger and so what happens with this plan is we went full doors so she wanted everything divided she wanted her living room to have a door and his living room back here behind a wall and this door Le leads out to a a hot tub back here and so um this is fully closing everything off and giving her a space where she can entertain and just kind of pretend the rest of the house doesn't exist uh in this plan she got a clo or a a pantry bigger bathroom and she sees some benefit from that here's the new work that would be required to get this design to work and some 3D views so this room right here can be completely private can be her own option three I jumped to option three very early in the process so I said hey what about doing this and she said oh no no no no that's more than I want to do but then she thought about it I sent her I said I'll send you views you can you can think about it and we'll do whatever you want to do she thought about it and she said yeah I think I probably should consider that so with this one same things on the exterior except we added a little bit more trim um and painted at a different color same deck all of that however with option three we're able to get a back patio and I'll show you why so we're able to get some additional outdoor space with with option three so I can show that option three involves completely gutting the main floor um and I'm able to have a conversation with a homeowner at this point or in the point of design saying you know that is more expensive however some Builders will give better pricing if they can open everything up and address exis issues with the house and make sure that the infrastructure can handle a new design versus not being able to open anything and tying into older infrastructure and so I said sometimes they actually appreciate being able to cut the main floor however it's hard for a contractor to suggest that because that's more work for them so they can't really do that without seeming like they're trying to do a bigger project most of them would rather do a bigger project and so in this case what I recommended was putting the two bedrooms back on the dark quiet part of the house away from all the action and then putting the living room dining room kitchen up here towards the front where it's sunny it's active it's bright um we can still do a very small sun room that can be closed off but it's not taking up so much of her house to close that off and then she also gets a laundry room which she doesn't currently have so again she could see that's a lot more work but if we're going to sell the house in 10 years we can update everything and we may get the value of that back when we go to sell so you can see the new work documented that way 3D views and this is it we are done working on this project at this point so we're done with schematic design this is a complete schematic design we've built for it we're paid for it and we are moving on the homeowner has this book now to go and speak with contractors to try to decide which direction to go to get pricing Builders sometimes have suggestions those things can be addressed later once she has a builder to work with because we work more collaborative collaboratively so this one that's all that's all I did that's all I may ever do they may not do any work they may decide it's too expensive it doesn't matter I still got paid for the work that I did for the new house this is a pretty standard um set that we do for a new house so it's got um kind of a splashy cover page and then um site plans schematic site plans 3D views schematic roof plan but we don't call out materials or any construction and that's the key is not calling out construction unless you are working directly with the contractor this one here was referred by a contractor and this is the foundation and notes he wanted I would not do this on one where I don't have a contractor already to work with so I'm not exposed to any um any crazy construction ideas so I don't get involved in construction until I have a builder to collaborate with uh we'll do floor plans with uh Dimensions to Center Line so that things are flexible uh 3D views more plans than 3D views this I have found is one of the more valuable parts of the process we document the model and I tell people we're not doing construction drawings for a house we're documenting the model that we built the model has Windows in it and the windows we document a schematic size for those because they're all a similar proportion and a look most Builders have suppliers that they prefer to work with and they get the best pricing from those suppliers May in our area may only have one window that they one type of window that they sell the homeowner may not like that type of window they may have experience and don't like it this set frees them up to be able to go get pricing from other window manufacturers without the homeowner having to go do shopping for them or the Builder the Builder can stay in his um relationship with his supplier the homeowner can go and search for other materials this way so I've got additional elevations sections 3D views more building sections more 3D views and again the Builder can see okay we got a we got a window in here we can talk about those things homeowner can describe it and then this is how I handle finishes for a new home we take photographs that the homeowner has supplied they're usually keyed to an idea that's in the model so the homeowner can say this is what I want in the mud room I want this wne coat on the walls the Builder can look at this without me having to specify everything and go whoa that's a higher level of finish even though everything is readily available for the most part that's going to be more expensive to finish I'm going to bid accordingly what happened with this one we still working it out but um Builder bid it I thought the bid was extremely good and the homeowner said well that's a little too much what they're doing they want the finishes they're keeping the finishes so now the Builder's working on some other ways to frame it if I had done a complete construction set for this that's going to be a ton of extra cost so this is flexible and the Builder can make adjustments to try to get them the level of finish that they want because that's what's more important in their case so back to here so again when I write a proposal I write my proposals with these four phases built in I've got a budget of time for each phase a minimum amount it's going to take me or it's worth it to me to do and then I've got a bunch of padding in there so the home owner knows it's going to take me at least 30 hours they're paying for that amount and I can also by the way adjust my S my hourly rates so if my designer or my intern can work on it we maybe don't charge as much if it's schematic design that requires me to do we'll charge more for so we can adjust those rates to get a bid that works for us but also works for the homeowner and I will say I have a friend that I'm working with who is developing his own version of this but he lives in Pasadena total opposite situation of where I live and so his hourly rates are going to be adjusted for the types of projects he'll be doing in Pasadena and what the homeowner there would be willing to pay for and so again people have a guaranteed minimum and then also a maximum that we won't go over and we have a maximum for each part so I'm not going to go over the maximum for any one of those parts and so this gives people reassurance they know how much it's going to be and I tell people now that I've been doing this a long time I tell them we're typically right around my base budget because I know now how to budget it based on the interview I know about how long I think it's going to take and most projects probably 80% of my projects are right around that minimum amount and so people are really happy because they see what they could be paying and they got in at the minimum so they think oh we were easy and we didn't have to pay extra and so it's really nice for construction phase because everyone's thinking what do we do about construction what do you do about construction we can do construction drawings as you know SketchUp can do amazing construction drawings we only want to do it if we can get paid for it and if we're not trying to read some contractor's mind we will work with the contractor as a team or with the homeowner if they need to see something if the contractor makes a suggestion that's going to affect the look of the design we will come back in adjust the model to show how that will look and then the homeowner can make a final decision and so we work as a subcontractor through um through the construction phase so we've worked on houses where they could afford to have us we had a client that lives in California we would go out every single week we were there eyes and ears and would model everything so we built that house down to the door knobs and we did Full Construction drawings for that versus most of our clients 95% of our clients we are not even doing anything for construction Builders will take it over and I've had Builders say to me I love your drawings because you don't tell me what to do I don't like them because I have to figure it out and so they're able able to do that it might be a little more work because sometimes we're doing something a little more custom but they like it um and the reason for this is the work is going to be performed by a contractor the contractor is presumably licensed and insured and they're going to be pulling the necessary building permits sometimes I have clients who want to do their own work I am not going to do construction drawings for someone who's not licensed and not insured so I don't get involved I have a hard boundary on what I'm going to include in that sit set if I do construction drawings it has to be under uh a licensed builder in the end the contractor is also responsible for their bid and they're going to be the one warranting the work so let's say they bid the project one way it's a pain for me to come in and say oh why' you do it that way or why didn't you use that product I wanted you to use I stay totally out of that because I may have a project I or product I love that the Builder knows is going to be a complete pain for them down the road so I stay out of all of that and I just help moderate design questions once there is an agreement to build between the homeowner and a builder so with that renovation project once she has an agreement with a builder then I told her I'll come in and do finishes with her all day long so I can do that on an hourly basis and just help her put in finishes and help her figure out how the furniture looks I'll help with anything I just have to make sure it's fillable and I have the time to do it and so what happens what's really my favorite part about this whole process this is the best part is we leave the drawings off right here so this is the last I did for this house was this um this detail and so you can tell it's there's not a lot of information there but there's plenty of information there for the homeowner and the Builder to finish out so what happened is Here's the final I just saw it a couple weeks ago the homeowner probably has been in maybe a week now so um what happened is they built this beautiful Charming little stained glass window I have no idea where they found it I don't know how long it would have taken me to find that but between the homeowner and the Builder they knew what they wanted to do and they were able to do it and then just before I came to the conference this popped up on the Builder's Facebook page and so again the homeowner had expressed a desire to have a move a hidden bookcase and I thought I'm not sure I'm going to saddle any Builder with that he'll do it so um he's super proud of this I have no idea how he fits through that opening so I think it's bigger than it looks in his video but I haven't seen the bookcases I've seen the window and so he's super proud of this he's promoting it as his work because it is and it's a collaborative team project that we're all working on together and so it's truly enjoyable to see what everybody brings to the table and what we can produce and this gives a home that can't afford maybe all of the fancy finishes that they want so something charming and special and something to make it Grandma and Grandpa's home so with that I'm open to questions if you have any questions from uh watching this video you're welcome to send them to me I'll get to them as soon as I can and there's more information on our website and I'd be happy to talk to any of you about doing this because it's a extremely fun process and it really connects with the way we worked in school and the joy of being an architecture school so thank you very much [Music]
