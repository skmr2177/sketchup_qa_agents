hi and welcome to the 3D base camp Dimensions presentation um for my second session this was a session that unfortunately due to um the registrations pre the conference was cancelled um as there weren't significant um amount of signups which is great for me because I could attend more sessions from other people and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed um all the sessions at the at the base camp workshops however when I presented my other session uh which was about um using gray boxing as a design technique for retail um I came across quite a few people who asked about the other session that I was going to host um so I promise them I would make sure to record this session um and as part of Trimble and sketchup's effort um to all these sessions online I am now recording this session from my home in South Africa um having fully prepared for it to show it to you at Bas Camp so we're now going to do some base camp online um and just to make sure that I was fully prepared I even put my um my SketchUp name tag back on to really feel like um I was back at the conference um this was orally meant to be a 4H hour long session it was going to be a workshop that was going to cover multiple uh aspects of um multiple aspects of design for retail um with the primary focus to uh Window Shop fronts and what I had initially planned was to set out the session across four hours so that we cover some um retail insights some retail history um some current trends within um shop front window design um and hence hopefully to create a bit of interested people who weren't necessarily working in the retail industry then the second half of the of the four hours is going to be spent on demonstrating to you the workflow um that I like to use and then second to that was going to be um this this in-person experience so I'm not going to do a 4H hour session now don't worry um I'm going to do a one and a half to two hour session so I'm going to give you the breakdown of everything that I wanted to cover in the in the original presentation from the from the history and the current trends and then I'll basically demonstrate to you the the workshop element then feel free to um to follow along with that on your on your own laptop or computer and then um if you've got any questions then do reach out to me on on YouTube um LinkedIn or wherever so um that for any further uh discussion or for any for the workshops ideas and questions that you might have we can then continue on um making those recordings let me start walking through the the slides okay so the original title of the of the session was called digital twins in retail on how to revolutionize your retail window display campaigns from planning to installation so here's me um I run a small design studio in South Africa um a work environment where young apprentices can Thrive as it says to explain a little bit on that um I was born and raised in the Netherlands I worked as a volunteer in an orphanage in lutu um a small landlock country inside of South Africa and um and having worked in that orphanage I I understood and realized the difficulty of transitioning as um as a young man or a young woman out of um out of an orphanage and so I um I realized in the last few year of my own professional career and uh becoming a business owner how important it was to have young person a young person or young people on your team um who as apprentices can learn the tradeit uh not everyone has the privilege or um the financial ability to enter um a college or um or get um get a scholar scholarship for a degree um so these two young men in the middle and banii and on the right hand side Juku they've worked with me for um the last year year and a half and um and they don't have um a degree Beyond a high school diploma what's nice or um what's interesting is that as a trainer in the whole SketchUp environment um I know get to train them on SketchUp but also on design thinking and design principles in retail um you know architecture um and in event planning um so it really is a um a wonderful environment where I can train them while at the same time um I can train them in a way that is really suitable to the environment that they get to work in um so I suppose it's um very specific training all right well these are some of the tools that we like to use um that we like to focus on when we um talk to you about our workflow so here what um what we've got all these different tool sets uh physical and digital tools combined on one page um and these are some of our favorites um and you'll see throughout the demonstration that we really hone in on the tools that we like to use and try to make our workflows as accessible and as um and as coste effective and efficient as possible uh specifically with these tools so what you'll see here is the Google workspace Suite um we use Affinity in set of Adobe for all our image processing um and Vector artwork um of course we use SketchUp um but we also use some iPad uh plugins or some iPad apps to um to do some laser scanning to draw up some floor plans really easily and we've got our favorite standy measuring tool um but we also like to use pencils and our favorite pencil is a Blackwing Blackwing 602 so these are some of these tools if you've got questions about these feel free to ask leave a comment in the video or again Ask on lingon what caught your eye um and how you um how you would incorporate it in your workflow just let us know all right like all grade businesses the only thing you have to do is an entrepreneur start in your garage um so when I started my business I started in my garage I'm glad to tell you the space doesn't look like this now uh but rather like this um and so that's where Amber is sitting um in South Africa you don't really see Herman Miller chairs that often but we've got uh three three unique ones um so we've got some comfortable comfortable chairs we've used open desk um to cut our own to cut our own desks using a C Machine in um in our local industrial area and we've got a whole range of books so um we love Ai and we love Pinterest and getting inspiration from all kinds of sources um but it's also really healthy to turn all your digital devices off and book some time in the studio to focus on design and Design Concepts and not um not be too fasted by um by all the digital um bells and whistles and then return to some book format uh to um to get creative in my day-to-day life um I've got a wonderful uh family and um I've got five children so during this photo shoot my children decied to join me and um come and tell me about the food that they were eating that day so we uh we strike an odd balance in our studio when in the afternoon when the kids come from school they um they often tend to walk in every now and then and so this um this put things in perspective and helps us um stay humble in our life that um work is work it's not all there is um our families are far more more important um but we're glad to to support our families knowing what what our work offer us so back to back to the presentation this is more than enough about me in the studio um this is um this is about our our topic of today the retail the retail environment of um storefronts and um and digitizing that that process creating these digital twins so I want to speak to you at first about um what a digital twin is and how you want to use it one is speak to you about how to digital twin fit in with retail then I want to go through the the retail environment the history where we currently find ourselves where the industry is moving to um and then we're going to go into the into the physicality of it so we're going to optimize the workflow using SketchUp and layout um the Hands-On demo of course we're going to skip so that's all going to be demonstrated to you in that workflow session and then we're going to simply draw our conclusions and again there's no real Q&A here but feel free to leave a comment in the in the video all right digital Twins and Retail the first section so if you think back to a digital twin um as it was um 20 30 years ago you come back to um space agencies right um NASA as a as an organization creates a digital um a digital model and um and this Digital model is virtual space um to basically help the astronauts learn how to fly a rocket before they fly the physical rocket so there's no SpaceX at that time there's no frequent rocket flying and there are limited rockets and limited tryouts so um the more you could train in Virtual space the easier it would be so you get this um this simulation that you didn't take part in um in which you can test and monit monitor your um your flight capacity so how do we how do we take the digital twin information then into the world of SketchUp and Retail well we've got our SketchUp for desktop application uh we've got our Trimble connect as our Cloud solution and we've got a physical retail space now the physical retail space with rfids and Wi-Fi and all other digital connectivity can speak back to the cloud so you can integrate um into Trimble with any any of your plugins and your and your technology and then you can communicate it back to your your Digital model um in your SketchUp environment so in retail when we use a digital twin and you see the process laid out here um as an example store um it helps us um a whole lot but we can't all working for a retailer um that has multiple Outlets visit every single store um spread around the country or spread around a province or a state um that would bad be bad for um the environment traveling so much but it would also be um very um ineffective for your time um and cost to your business so we can enhance our visualizations and our design accuracy by creating multiple models of multiple stores so we get a library of digital twins um we can collaborate between our teams you can you can showcase a digital store to a team you don't have to physically travel to that store with that team member or that um that group of people from another team um this will then of course reduce costs and make it more efficient because you save a lot of time from all this traveling and then um it improves installation Precision so as you as you have all the windows of the store um and the depth um and the height of the storefront all digitally mapped out you can easily switch from one store to the next and create a campaign for all your stores using all these digital representations now it is then of course also a scalable solution so if you do one thing in one store you can simply copy it over to all the other stores and then create um a campaign that any marketing manager or marketing director can approve of um because they can see how how um each campaign element reflects in each store environment so this enhances the customer experience because um for each customer not you not every customer will visit every store over the live time of a campaign um most customers will will visit one store and perhaps maybe even see a second store so the the consistency of the narrative that you as a business create the consistency of that campaign is also preserved and then you can future proof any of your ideas so you can use the digital twin in AR and VR um you can feed it into your AI and get all kinds of um of feedback um posing inquiries you can step into a VR environment where you've got all the stores lined up next to each other and jump from one into the other store to get a feeling for what that experience is going to be of that new campaign um so this is a wonderful uh tool set and just to illustrate to you what we've done here on the right hand side we visited the store we took some photos outside the store uh we did um a 3D scan using an iPad um of course with SketchUp now you can use scan to design and then we created um a 3D model in SketchUp so that is part of the workflow that we're going to explain today all right so so let's go a little bit into the detail of this so your digital twin that you can create um it creates visualization and design accuracy of course for every campaign you might want to adjust lighting and you might want to consider product placement uh you want to uh look at how different materials will'll look in the window dressing um how different materials will behave in the different store environments and so you can use your digital twin for incredibly fast iterations and and approval process processes so imagine that the more stores that you have to that you have to get approval on um The More Design um time that will eat up um and you are held accountable to the amount of campaigns that your brand wants to execute across the year um so your timelines or deadlines in that sense are pretty unmovable but you need to um work within the time given to you as a team so here is um is a wonderful way of of using that now if you want to um create efficient collaboration between teams imagine this if you have a global retail brand let's say operating out of Germany and um you might have a Creative Design agency in the United States um and you might want to execute the um the installation process in the stores that are in South Africa then you need to work across quite a few locations time zones and teams so um this is a good example of how you can ensure that there's consistency across campaigns globally without the need for excessive travel or without the need for excessive project management um from um the head office the regional office or the regional installation team can continue with what they're doing knowing full well what the corporate Identity or the campaign identity uh dictates um how the creative team in another country has come up with a good idea um and how you are going to execute it in the point of origion then for the sake of cost and efficiency this digital twin that we've now created in which you're going to execute all these campaigns um if you want to change sizes of one of your your elements um instead of making a physical mockup um or go through a costly prototyping phase you can digitally dress up all these windows right so this will eliminate uh that cost now of course we need to um we need to get used to these techniques um not Everything feels um feels sensory um very well explained if you don't see it physically right so you might create a digital walkup um put on some VR goggles and then stand in front of the window um you get an impression of what that looks like it might not be completely photo realistic um it doesn't carry any sense you can't uh feel any textures and so there are some drawbacks in this um in this solution but for all intents and purposes considering how many campaigns you might do in the year um the drawback of having to create a physical mockup and the time that this costs um the digital the digital creation um creat it's a level of speed and efficiency that the mockup simply can't match the installation Precision so the digital twin can easily be shared with the installation team and if we place our digital twin inside of layout and we share all the different views and all the different um perspectives and all the different installation guides with our team then we can really easily create a installation template or a sign off template for a marketing team so that you can set up a display in a flagship store using your digital twin you can ensure that the dimensions and the placement of the fixtures and props match the design um and you can have all your specifications listed on one side all your artwork um and and fitments guides specifically for that store in place so this will avoid doing costly rework on site right a piece of vinyl or fabric Banner might be too short or too long you might need to make adjustments you want to iron out all those issues and as your installation teams get more and more comfortable with installing multiple campaigns across the year of course they will also come back with feedback on um all these different installation aspects so this becomes a scalable solution for multi-store campaigns right as we've discussed you can create digital twins of every single store um if you manage that globally or locally you can ensure that everything is accurate and you can then produce it across um hundreds of stores worldwide and in this case we were working with a client um that had over 30 stores that needed um monthly changes and so um you can take a look at how all of this plays out um I will share with you the end of this session in the in the descript deson the links to all of these if you want to rewatch this outside of the presentation uh but for now I'll just demonstrate you how this looks over five stores so here you can see uh the window dressing uh the fabric banners that sit on the wall um how the vinyl is applied to the windows um and how across different stores this shows um in various manners so in the demonstration we will go through these five stores um and we will create a um IM imaginary brand we'll create a brand of our own and we'll create a campaign and then we'll apply that campaign to the different Windows um let's get out of this what more well we can enhance the customer experience and personalization and these are some bigger topics that you'll hear about over of years to come and this is sort of the the trending ideas uh that people are talking talking about and discussing what you can do of course with a digital twin is you can create an overlay if you've got any cameras or um sensors inside the store you can do uh let's say heat mapping of high traffic zones um in your store so you can consider the whole store design create a heat map of how customers interact in the store space which spaces which product displays they visit the most uh which areas they tend to avoid and then you can overlay that heat map in your digital twin in your uh SketchUp model and you can see which areas to tweak so that you can get better uh customer engagement throughout the store space and there are many more ideas um and variations of this kind of thinking in which um we in the future will see people using digital twins like this if you future proofed your retail experience with um any digital interactive engagement like um AR or VR then you can see what here some of the sportsware brands have done um where you can place a physical shoe on a um on a touch screen and then the the RFID Tech will recognize which shoe or which product you've placed on the table and hence the the interactive table display will change its descriptions its interact ability and its product explanation for each different product that you place on the table so you create these very futuristic experiences now anything digital that needs to be developed as a once off or it's a special tool comes with its own significant cost so the more and more times that you can test these ideas in AR and VR the the more cost effective you can execute these Solutions all right so let's talk about the retail environment so for those of you who don't work in the retail environment here's a little bit of a background um early markets and basic displays that we saw um leading up from ancient times uh to the 18th century I believe this is a photograph somewhere in um in the Middle East near turkey where you've got a um a half a half circular display where um all the the artist at the bottom were the different um storefronts the display Windows um as we would call them in modern times without glazing in this case in the 19th century we see the rise of the department store so we move away or we move from the temporary Market space to the more permanent uh department store environment um a lot of these department stores carry a variety of um of Edibles um daily use items and um we we can see that these environments look like um the bottom the bottom layer or the or the ground floor of homes um and so in busy cities we see that these these front rooms get transformed into into small uh store environments now the Golden Age of display as it is um shown here in the UK or in France is that people start to really make use of the Windows as as an Innovative um idea and this window dressing this dressing up of the of the window space becomes a real way to attract customers um so the consumer um industry um or consumerism takes hold of people and um we start to purchase more than we necessarily need and in that environment to attract more customers to a store allow us of course the use of the the window display area now the post for consumerism the emergence of branding between the 1950s and' 7s so you can think of any time after the second world war um shows us these more modern variations so um here The Branding above the storefront with the w worth logo here on a red background uh the entrance and the exit really clearly defined uh two store front windows on left and right hand side of the of the walkway and then some specific products and um some disclaimers and some call outs uh talking about discounted products so then in our current day and age we see shopping as an experience and digitization and so here's a wonderful example in contrast to the previous Store where the whole storefront has become digitized it's become a a massive LED screen it talks about the or it shows the experience of the life in the city at night um and then even in the back of the store behind all the product displays we see um people in a in a sporting moment on um what looks like um like a soccer player so you can see the the digitization and the inclusion of digital screens in the in the retail space takes a hold all right then a little bit about the psychology of shopping and how much we interact with a storefront window um how much time do we spend looking at a storefront roughly 4 seconds um what is the size of a storefront in relation to the store walls well about 8% um so let's say one tenth of your total wall display area is actually the storefront and how do you how do you capitalize on that how do you make good use of that 70% of all retail pures are still made in physical Stores um like I iterated previously we can do um we can create beautiful VR engagement with our designs uh within our marketing teams and our um our campaign and strategy teams and so why do we why do we still go to physical Source because of the sensory experience we we want to go there because want to touch things want to smell something want to engage with a person who sells us the product in a knowledgeable manner um we want to see beyond the product that we want to buy we go to a store for one product we we might make multiple purchases because by association of that one product that we set out to purchase uh we saw a whole another variety of things that we either had need for or a desire um to make that purchase so this is this is how Windows fit into into the retail space well 80% of customers are more likely to enter the store if there's an eye-catching window display so perhaps not every person that's entering your store um has done so determinant you know they left their home space they left their office space after a long day at work and they walk through the city center and they saw they saw an attractive window display um you might engage with people who had no intention of visiting your store that day but because of what you created in the window they now want to come inside 24% of people report making an impulse purchase so an attractive window display might not just attract a person to come into the store that they initially hadn't planned to do so but 24% of those people might even make a purchase and 30% of all stores with creative window displays see an increase of food traffic by up to %. so comparatively to stores where there's not such a good window display or where there simply isn't um space in the Physical Realm for um window dressing you can see that there's a % uh difference in food traffic all right so why well as we draw people in we strategically design these displays and we combine our creativity with a focus on product so retailers can not only attract attention but they can create a lasting impression that drives customers to engage um and be loyal to the brand so how do we how does that play out and how do we see that well we can see that um especially with The Branding with the brand name uh brightly or illuminated above the store and people people's attention is attracted to your store uh we can design a experience at the front of the store here's a here an experience to try on a different running shoe um and that's like a game environment we're told that that we start here this is the start of the level this is the start of the experience um so a well that a welld designed display can actually really draw customers in and we boost that that food traffic and sales if we if we do it well 80% more people walking in um we communicate our brand identity and our values so we set a um a expectation but we also communicate um what our values are and what we stand for um what is the the identity of our brand are we luxurious are we sustainable are we innovated are we are we focused on trending so it sets a tone for what people will expect inside so you might actually create the opposite of what you wanted you might actually create a level of attraction by making an incredibly beautiful storefront display uh but the store itself Beyond might not be as attractive so how do you balance that if we showcase product um we can also showcase a promotion and thinking of Black Friday uh Cyber Monday thinking along the lines of end of season sale um as temperatures change and and different types of garments are um are needed we we tend to Advocate um that our best sellers our collections are ending new collections are coming in um so this is a wonderful way to make customers aware um of the change in um the change in the collections and then last but not least in this environment we can also engage emotionally and creatively in a way that makes it um a deeper uh meaningful memorable experience for a customer we're not um we're not just shopping for the sake of it we're shopping for needs uh we're shopping for basic requirements in people's lives um we're using creative storytelling to draws people attention to a certain environmental aspect um we're talking to the customer about the issues that we face as a global population um on any given day on our dear Mother Earth and so in this scenario the storefront is um talking to us about the topic of plastic and the topic of waste and how we should um emphasize recycling amongst all peoples and here the idea was that if the description is clear enough and draws the customer to awareness it will also Drive the customer to action to recycle better and be more attentive to this and the way that it is display to us is not so much that the storefront is a display of bottles it is that the whole store has become full of bottles um SO trading in the store has been suspended um and the whole store is now full of bottles and um and the actual storefront the window um has a vinyl text that draws our attention to the call to action all right so what we're going to do in the workshop element is of course talk to you about visual merchandising specifically in the storefront so we're not going to talk so much about merchandising um and creating visual window displays in the store we're only talking about the window today most of my inspiration and most of my guidance in um in this aspect has come from this wonderful book called visual merchandising by uh Tony Morgan it's now in its fourth or fifth um Edition you can find this book easily on Amazon or any local um good bookstore close to wherever you are in the world and so much of what I want to discuss today in terms of topics and and ways of communicating to you what what is important has come out of this book so I cannot um yeah I just want to highly recommend it to you so we're going to talk about store window design how to how we arrange products props visual elements and how we attract attention to what we're doing uh we communicate the brand identity we entice the passer by to enter the store and so this Art and Science this compelling first impression that we're trying to create this balance between the customer emotional intelligence and our physical manufacturing and and um and prop making um that is going to tell a story for us as um as visual merchandisers today so we're going to talk about product selection so our um our philosophy our um our way of thinking is that we don't want to overcrowd the window with too many products that's going to overwhelm the viewer as I said before we only have sort of four seconds to draw people's attention to the storefront um we could be talking about new arrivals we could be talking about discounted items we could be talking about the end of season sale so all our promotional material is going to align with our marketing objective here um so hopefully our digital marketing also is aligned to our physical marketing our storefronts um are hopefully telling the same story as our digital marketing is those two um should integrate our storytelling and themes and her May does a wonderful um I want yeah does a does a really good job with their visual visual retail designers in in illustrating this here in this image um the first thing that pops into your head here right is that we're talking about some um some space some outer space engagement um a a theme has been set for us that uh maybe the materials that are being used are in some way related to um Astro um astroengineering um maybe some of the the stylizing of this um aims back at the 1960s and the 1970s when we see the first moon visits and so all all of these things speak to us in such a captivating way um as Spas is um is definitely a trending topic at the moment with the the advancements that we're making in the in the rocket industry so we can engage with customers we give them a context to our product but we're also creating a fun way to interact with our customer this this is definitely one of those ones offs um but by using perspective by using props um and the actual product we create a really engaging engaging platform lighting and color are so important in these um in these situations we want to strategically use lighting to uh amplify or exemplify um want to illustrate we want to highlight certain portion or a certain section of the window we want to create a mood we want to evoke emotions um we want to create um soft lighting or harsh lighting we want to set the energy that you might experience in the store by illustrating it in the window and so all these uh these tonalities will speak to us if we go back to that first statement of not overcrowding the window we want to focus on Simplicity we want to create a focal point and sometimes the focal point like here is a mannequin um avoiding clutter the key product that we want to showcase here is on the mannequin the jacket the Jersey here in question is the main item the bag is secondary um the folio that's hanging up to his um his left hand side is is another one um the um the scarf or the umbrella are sort of third level element right these all these things fit together but the most important thing is is perhaps the jack than dep pend so that becomes the focal point of our campaign and that's how each time we want to create a display um that focuses our our um our potential customer um on the main thing and then using signage and messaging um especially here in this case focused on selling something at the end of um of a life cycle at the end of a um yeah at the end of a season this illustrates to us what what we can and and what we can't do right buy one get one free what can you do you can buy one what do you get you get one free okay this is a very very easy to understand a premise as um as a customer if I walk in now I'm going to walk in expecting a spring sale so we're selling all the all the late winter um early summer items and um the spring collection is about to leave the store this is my last chance this last opportunity to engage with these products to purchase them and to use them and the benefit for me is that because the The Collection is leaving the store and all the summer things are coming in um I get a significant discount so the brand messaging here is important I'm not trying to use very long sentences because again there's only this sort of 4C window in which we can attract the customers attention all right so that's enough for today about the um the retail environment that we've been talking about the retail history the way of doing things in retail I want to go back to the topic that we're addressing of optimizing our workflow using SketchUp um specifically with the digital twin so here's the workflow introduction that I want to share with you today um the client that we worked with at Studio jdb was a space fit retail implementation a local um creative implementation team and installer for sports brands in South Africa uh we were asked to set out the seamless SketchUp workflow to for Creative client approval manufacturing print and installation so that's a mouthful right um you create a digital twin in SketchUp so that you can put all the creative campaigns in there and client approves what you have designed so um the sports brands that space fit in this case deals with um they have a creative director they have a marketing manager they will approve on the on the campaign first then space fit as a as a business needs to do its own manufacturing um not that they they will do any and every manufacturing but for what they can do in house they will um and the printing Etc and then the installation so between these um five different um approval processes we need to present a a digital twin model a layout template that speaks either to all of them or specifically to each of them now before we came onto the scene and help them to develop this system they were um they were using spreadsheets mostly and spreadsheets are wonderful ways to um to convey information it's just that sometimes they can feel um they can feel cumbersome to create as a template um it's sometimes that um unlike SketchUp they don't have necessarily Dynamic components um or quantity take off capability and so they can feel um horribly manual they take up a lot of time in that sense they can also be automated but they're not necessarily a visual tool so you might um feel that you come stuck with a uh with a spreadsheet where something in the store design changes or um something changes in the way that the brand engages with the customer in in the in the store itself and that you can't translate what is visually available to the customer onto the spreadsheet um so how were they using their spreadsheets well it had all the elements the sizes the substrates and the quantities um it had rols for different store zones with is new and existing elements and it had the storefront folder to identify the premise so you can see it's it's difficult to engage with much more with much more um visual information than just a storefront photo right um You Can't navigate through that photo that is a still image okay well during the process um of engaging with them we use the presentation format so we switch from an Excel sheet to a PowerPoint presentation and this had multiple photos right multiple photos and on-site measurements that were taken so they were using two tools they were Now using a spreadsheet um a PowerPoint document or um sometimes exported as a PDF and it showed all the dimensions of the windows the lighting uh the floor area that you could use for your activation element for your campaign and then the spreadsheet back that all up with all the element size substrate and quantities listed so that you could manufacture all right then what did we propose and and how are they currently operating afterwards well we created a point cloud based SketchUp model and we've got a a laser scanner um that we use for retail spaces you can also use an iPad um or your phone um to to do some laser scanning you can then create that point Cloud you can use that to create your SketchUp model your digital twin um you can take 360 photos and you can do wall by wall photography as we've showcased here and so these three visual elements the point Cloud the 3D SketchUp model the 360 photograph or the 360 video and the wall by wall um face on photos they all um show you different levels of detail and specific specificity so they're all great as information methods and they all can live together in the cloud right you can put the point cloud in a point Cloud directory uh you can store all your photos on Google photos as a way to um engage with the 360 photos um and you can create a gallery for each store or photo album for all the the wall by- wall photos so we created a layout file for Creative layout file for production and a layout file for installation so we used the the same digital twin in each of these layout files but using the digital twin to illustrate different levels of detail so for the creative of course we're looking purely at how the customer engages with this space and if it all looks looks right and um operates properly for engagement in a production file we're trying to ensure and showcase to the manufacturer what the best way of manufacturing is or what specifically we want manufacturers how and uh using what materials and then for the installation team we Tred to create an efficient and effective document that illustrates how many items need to be installed when and where um in which areas of which specific store and then last but not least we did not do away necessarily with the the spreadsheet but um we kept our spreadsheets for packaging and for dtp so for uh desktop publishing for all the artwork setup we kept the spreadsheets and so what you then end up with is a point Cloud visual information layout files uh to present to the different teams and and the spreadsheets and the wonderful thing here is that each of these pieces of information also operates as a backup for one another the spreadsheets of course have information that historically was available um so that is useful the the layout files comprehend all the uh the ways of installing manufacturing and creative but they also um have a backup of the SketchUp model in um embedded and then the photos and the point Cloud models show us the physicality space at a point in time and we can update these um budget and um and timing dependent uh with a certain frequency so that we have a historic view of um of how our brand evolved so in conclusion we had um a team that operated using a storefront photo and a spreadsheet um we help them to transition U or we help them in the transition process to use photos um in detail for each Zone using a presentation document and a spreadsheet and then lastly we had a lighter model 360 photos w w photos um creative in SketchUp and layout production in SketchUp and layout and installation in SketchUp and layout so that brings us to the workflow that we um adhere to and this depending on how many stores you operate in it can be quite a laborous process so maybe set out with your team to do this over the course of a of a season um over the course of a um maybe an annual Financial year and what you would want to do is you want to um collect as much data as possible right so perhaps you can visit your store in the morning uh before opening time or after closing time and you can take all your photos you can bring with your iPad or or your liar scanner and you can make that point Cloud scan uh you can assemble that scan you can do an inside and an outside scan separately of each other um you can then build those digital twin models you can insert all your campaign elements and then of course you can create your various outputs um for your different teams now a little bit from our process um in our data collection um together with the space fit team we made sure that we used um a measuring tape to measure each individual element we use the 360 photos to give you a visual representation of the space so if you're dealing with teams that don't know how to use a measuring table they don't know how to use a liar scanner the middle of the road method right in this case is to use um is to use 360 photos then for the more technical Advanced people you give them access to the to the liar scan um and you can use SketchUp scan to design or you can use a trimble scanner or any other scanner within um your um your prize range to to collect that kind of data now the accuracy of this is also important so if you have very specific manufacturing requirements then please use a measuring tape so that you are operating within a millimeter accuracy um if you're using a liar scanner of any various brand you might have to deal with um an accuracy that is smaller or larger than um 10 mm or um larger than um let's say half an inch so you want to make sure that you that you um that you capture this data but that you also capture this data with um the purpose in mind with the end goal in mind so it's no use to take a point Cloud scan and then to expect people um to take measurements within the point Cloud scan that give you the exact accuracy of let's say a fabric frame that you um that you have in the storefront window right you would you would expect that the fabric frame is measured with the stanle measure measuring tape and sometimes we don't um we don't need that level of accuracy but especially once you have a silicon beaded fabric frame and you need that tension fabric to snap into into place you want to make sure that that is accurate right from the start if for some reason you don't have that accuracy requirement let's say you're using vinyl and the vinyl is always printed with a significant amount of bleed then you can use a Point Cloud scan or even an iPad scan to give those measurements to your manufacturing team but over time hopefully your installation team will take note of some of the the issues or the the intricacies of installing all these elements and they will use measuring tape that they have on hand hand to maybe remeasure or refine some of those measurements and in line with that um your the relationship between your design team and your installation team becomes so important and you want to um you want to really Foster a culture of appreciation for one another so that the data that you get back from site gets Incorporated in your design model um and that you're not just focus on creating the creative element in the design process but that you as the Creative Design Team also um enhance or increase the level of accuracy on behalf of your installation team so that point Cloud assembly here we see that sort of lowlevel um accuracy from um from the iPad app this was an assembly between a outdoor scan and indoor scan so putting these two together allowed us together with the with the photos of the of the installation space to to create a really accurate Point Cloud scan and really accurate measurements of the storefront window to draw out the store so this the actual store measurement whether the store is um you know 100 by 100 foot 10 x 10 m uh 30 by 30 m or you know 31 m or 101 ft that's not necessarily the accuracy that we're looking for here we're looking it for the accuracy for the window so the window is measured with the the measuring tape and the storage scanned with an iPad so this creates a wonderful model in which we can really understand how the space Works how the customer engages in the space but the accuracy for manufacturing comes from the measurement using the the measuring type so here's a digital twin model created from the point cloud and that one side measuring um and here we've Illustrated in sort of the in sort of the red bases and the hanging elements of the fabric element in um in that sort of um Beach beat and beige um what is what is possible here and so the campaign elements on the windows are standing behind the window as a fabric frame that can be seen from both the left hand side and the right hand side of the store and then our output variations in our SketchUp model when we create this SketchUp model we make sure to tag everything between the exterior and the interior so that you can see um as the as the creative or the installation team what is required of us and so we have ways to create a layout output where you don't see the outside walls you only see the the inside installation elements and if you want to see all of that that's specifically in a in a sales campaign let's say at the end of a season then you can create layout templates that show um shoe insert apparel call out mood board elements light book fabric frames um the sock or the sleeve that sits over the the sensematic the the security gate at the entrance of the store uh we see the light boox Fabric branners and their sizes all of this fits into that um that one point Cloud Model that we've created all right so this is where we end the the demonstration up to this point um of our workflow and now we're going to go into the Hands-On demonstration where we will discuss the the model at um at length and so in this part we're going to we're going to go through the exercise of creating your own digital twins um creating your own shopfront windows and a layout document um to be able to explain everything that you've designed and created to your team so what I want to do in this session um is we're going to do a little bit of of a case study intro we're going to then demonstrate it to you um show to you how it works as a multi- retail store exercise and then I'm not going to do of course the store exercise guidance and assistance as we would have done in the workshop um I will leave you to do that yourself again if you've got any questions about this or remarks um while you're practicing yourself within this um within this exercise feel free to reach out to me um on YouTube on LinkedIn wherever okay uh best thing to do to follow along is go to the 3D warehouse and then type in the letter s for snake um-1 1201 and then press search you will then be able to download the same exercise file the same sketch of exercise file as I'm going to start working in for this demonstration I'll give you some time to to do that while you're doing that let me just elaborate so we're going to work through five stores so I've got five stores in this SketchUp model and we can use them in both SketchUp and in layout so that will that will help um for the layout file we're going to just set up something from scratch I'm just going to use a template um I suppose it would be amazing if you could download um layout files also from the three ous but that's a conversation for another day for now um each store that we're going to work on right each store is going to be um a window dressing and what we're going to do is we're just going to use a madeup brand right we're going to just make up a brand of our own and we'll use a little AI engine um like a DOL or some um some mid Journey kind of Imaging tool and then um that will allow us basically to create a bit of a brand uh we'll make up a brand from scratch and we'll think our way through this process what kind of product are we going to sell how we're going to display it we're going to use these five store fromont that I've given to you in the exercise file um to speed up our process because I want to not so much focus on how to draw something in SketchUp I want to want to really focus on the workflow between SketchUp layout and how you can create all these assets and then start to optimize your asset usage um across um across your campaigns now we'll be using as I said in the first part of this demonstration we'll be using Infinity designer as a prefer tool to set up um files for print so I'll demonstrate that to you throughout the process as well if you're using an adobe tool or any other image creation tool um that's not a problem at all feel free to do that um but you'll find there will be some slightly different tools hopefully everything else will feel the same in your preferred software okay um we're not going to go to the conclusion Q&A we're going to just jump out of this presentation and then we're going to jump into the SketchUp file this is the SketchUp file you're going to download so if you're struggling with that um let me show you here go to the 3D Warehouse on the left hand side in your large tool set um I'm going to download [Music] s-122 um did I type that right maybe I'm not getting it because I am um oh I'm typing this straight after I set it up in the cloud let me just type it with a capital um no base camp 2024 ah sorry I don't know exactly why I'm not getting the result that I wanted um but there are two files so this is 1744 is the other file um s122 is the exercise file for base camp uh 2024 for this session so if you download that file you can um you can find it there once downloaded as one 122 will look like this so you've got five stores um with five five scenes each scene for a different store okay um each store and I'm going to show you this starting with the tags each store will have a store tag group and a campaign tag group so that's just important to um to look at let's start with the store tag group right there are some tags here that hopefully make sense to your retail um drawings there's a Windows tag a sensematic the security gate and mannequin lighting flooring environment digital display ceiling and base so I'm just going to turn all of these on and off to illustrate to you what they are doing so this removes the windows with the glazing this removes the simatics this removes the base the red base that you see on the left this removes the ceiling uh the digital display whether it's a TV or an LED wall uh the environment in this scene is the the wall above the windows and the back wall that holds the fabric frame on the left the flooring sits on its own layer or on its own tag the lighting uh there's no mannequin in this store and then everything that's left is then not from the store but from the campaign right so I'm going to turn the tags back on and then just minimize the the the folder of tags and then I can also hide the folder so now I've hidden the folder of the store and then all that's left and visible to me is the campaign element so I've got a Windows vinyl a floor vinyl a fabric Banner um some dtp elements and a banner system so you can see I can hide all of these and then nothing is visible in the in the model anymore let's turn the store back on this then this process repeats itself for each of the five stores and I've drawn the stores in close proximity to each other so that you can see your model with five stores visible to you this makes it relatively easy to jump between the different stores in VR it makes it Rel ly easy for um your different teams to say okay what is the difference between this store and this store or maybe this store and that store and so you can see the the differences and do a comparison um it also keeps the file relatively tidy um I sometimes even make an effort to keep the spacing between each model or between each um store the same so that that the distances are relatively equal and then when you're in layout of course you want to zoom in you want to highlight one store so once I'm looking at this store I don't want to see the floor of that store so I might even hide um all of these store you can see I've I've locked some elements I'm just going to unlock that um I might just want to save my scene with all those other things hidden all right so that's just um that's just a little tip and then you can see here um as it goes to C two it's store to Etc now for some reason if you find it difficult to identify the different stores what I would recommend is just to create some 3D text um let's just use a standard aerial black font and I'm going to type in store in caps store three um give that a bit of an extruded thickness and a height and then place that right I'm we just going to place that along the base so now it's easy to identify store number three you would hopefully have a store name a city or um or um the name of a shopping center and then make the scenes and the store name the same so that Scene Three now becomes store three right in my um example okay that is about the basics of the of the SketchUp model now if you unhide everything you'll see that all the artwork that is applied to the store is also like um visible as a mini collection here um lying flat on the ground in front of every store the reason for that is that in the 3D perspective view that we're going to set up in layout we want to look at the store like this but if I switch the camera now to a top elevation and let's say that I've have hidden all the stores right or not even if I change my camera to only look at this selection I here have a nice com comprehensive overview of everything that gets installed in the store so hopefully you'll understand that the trick here is to set up all these physical elements in the store as components so that if you make changes to the components here it then reflects automatically in the store as well so this fabric Banner will then match with that fabric Banner this base with that base this finyl with um with that strip over here these two stic are standing there and then this vinyl um six times is um mounted to these windows there right so that is that is the overview of each store and hopefully you you you know you do that then correctly um across every environment so you can see how that how that grows and changes okay now what we're going to do is uh we're just going to minimize this and let me see where I can find um some form of an AI tool let's go to a standard um let's go to a standard DOL um thread and so what we want to do is we want to create a brand um that know exactly what we should create I suppose what we feel like today right um hi there let's create a um uh outdoor um hiking brand um with a specific uh flavor of uh product quality I'm just rambling on here specific flavor of product quality aimed at the global uh traveler who who has an affinity with um who has an affinity with South Africa let's make it local all right the brand name ideas the tagline um a core product offering a logo color palette okay great so here's more than enough information for us to play around with and I don't want to spend all day uh looking at this suggestion but let's start with um let's start with a name we've got five names here um the word Ubuntu and felt they sound relatively specific to South African culture uh felt fenter I suppose you could say that's more like an African's name and Ubuntu is of course was um a well-known um African word even outside of most African cultures um so that could work quite well drakensburg outfit is the drbg is a specific mountainous area in South Africa so that might make it a little bit too localized we do want to aim an appeal to the global traveler um let's go with um abtu trials for now or Trails I should say Okay auntu Trails [Music] tagline inspired by the wild built for the world okay let's not repeat the words of to twice that gets a little bit too um too much okay let's say um we want brand name two and tagline three um let's use brand name number two and tag align number three to design a logo okay let's dly create a beautiful image for us as useless or useful that might be as a as a rough concept not going to try and spend too much here okay it has created logos within logos and um this looks like the map of South Africa combined with a variety of other elements um May we're not being very specific in our in our prompt um but I understand what's happening here and I don't mind it let's just start with the top here um it in the case of the brand was created in 99 it has a African flag it's got the Boba tree in the center of the African map it cuts out lutu for all intents and purposes in swasiland which has a different name these days abun Trails inspired by the wild built for the from the world okay all right we're just going to take a screenshot of that we're going to be really lazy today um because if I download this as far as I know it downloads it as a web based image yeah that's not going to help us um let's take a screenshot out of snip and sketch on Windows and save that to our desktop as our logo all right and then um let's go back to our thread here um and let's say let's say we want a color scheme uh please create a color scheme for our brand okay ol of green burnt orange and base yes this all ties in quite easily M um can we use hex colors [Music] in can we use hex skelet in SketchUp I feel like I'm a little bit lost here uh large thumbnails let's create a new material [Music] um no no we cannot use hex okay never mind that's not too difficult let's rather go back and then for a moment instead of using a hex so okay um please create an image of these colors with squares hopefully it understands what we just said or using squares would probably have been a better problem hey there we go I mean it tries to put the values in this text can we save the image from here no it's still going to give us a web image fascinating that idea okay let's do the same thing with the screenshot and um let's save that image and call it a color palet and then let's just really easily let's just drag our logo um into our space here and using the scale to make it a little less of this and then our color palette will drag it off to the left before we lose our place um if you ever get lost to the scale handles you can set up a shortcut which in my case is the letter k um to see through your model um so you can find things so when you press the letter K you can see all these lines all these lines become dashed um so then when you select something and select something like the the fabric box behind here and you now press this skill to you can't see the skill to at the top right so press the letter K and then all of that becomes visible that's just a navigation tip let's stay on our current process Okay so we've got the iunu trail logo and we have the um the color palet for our brand and then what we hopefully now can do is we can update all these assets to show you them the use of this and what I'm going to do for this exercise is I'm I'm not of course going to use these physical models as um as they are apart from the sensome metic um I'm going we're going to create our own um our own version using these Stores um and as you can see at one or another stage I broke up this model um which I did clearly horribly um so let's actually just delete all the assets for the campaign and then our store should show up clean apart from these boxes okay let's remove these boxes okay that would be a clean store then the only thing that is left now is the stic and um the stic is still a component no is a group because I was going to say if I make a change here no it is still yeah if I make a change in the sense Matic it will update over across all stics through the project um so that could be easy for us going forward okay now let's addess this let's dress this up in this exercise um the iunu color that we have here and we're going to take this these existing stores that have a red stroke at the top here I'm going to make that Red Stroke the orange so what I'm going to do is really simply I'm going to explode this image and then I'm going to make a selection of the orange here which looks almost like a bit of a texture yeah and I'm going to say um make unique texture and then you can see here in the end the info box that in our materials um this texture has now become a color palet hash one unique texture I'm going to addit that and say don't use the texture image just use the color of the texture um so that is now our our color value so it has set that color value automatically based off um the average of the texture color right and if you addit that you can still go to the RGB values and make adjustments here but this gives you a rough representation of what what the color values actually are um and um what we'll do is we'll change the name from color pet to Ubuntu primary color primary color one okay um and that color we're now going to apply on our a red streak here um and the other thing we can do do is actually we can sample this color this 20 red and we say added this value [Music] following an object so basically red 20 is now become our primary color and that then should reflect in all the other Reds as well but it hasn't because these colors are named differently that just goes to show that that model looks a little bit clumsy uh but we can do the same thing we can also change the color of that now has that been a little bit more consistent no I do wish that these colors were the same value um so as you can imagine it is important to ensure that all your color values stay the same okay now we seem to have captured all the all the orangey colors and switch them from the red to the orange then let's take our logo um and let's explode that and we're just going to push pull this into the shape of a box and then for the shape of the Box we're going to sample our orange and we're going to paint everything apart from the front of the box that orange so that our primary color gets used a little bit more and then we'll scale this and make it a component and we'll call this logo side box one and then using the move tool we will make this vertical and then we can hopefully place this above every entrance and then scale it up that barely fits in this store so let's make it a little bit smaller and then just place it as best of all best as possible in the center um 160 mm okay that component we're going to then duplicate obviously and we'll Center we'll pick it up in the center and then hang it here if possible in the [Music] center and then here we will hang it up in the center but of course we'll move it to the front there we go and this probably we can adjust almost to the exact proportions of this window size you actually just leave that there for a moment let that hang there um we'll make another copy make another copy and we'll stick it here um for the sake of the exercise we're not going to fast too much about the snap points and making sure that it's exactly the right scale um so that sits above the glazing there and then this is our store number five and we can do the same thing scale that down a little bit and I move that to the front here that sits yeah top to bottom that's actually quite a good fit all right so now the orange ties in with the edging around the glazing of most stores and the Yun Char's logo is there and then that is our image now if for some reason of course this is a this is an AI um referenced image which we did really quickly for some reason you now are able to update this and create the actual logo within let's say your New Concept store um simply by editing this component that we have skilled to ratio across all five stores it will then update the logo of course for all five stores so that that would be a quick fix and our component component is already um making a life a lot easier across all five stores however if the ratio of the logo or the specific size and orientation of the logo changes store by store then you have to create unique components so then you have to approach each store perhaps individually that's not an issue and um it just means it can't be an automated process as much as we wanted it to be okay so that is the logo now let's start with some of our display boxes so let's say that we created a display base um you'll make that a foot in height or maybe that's a bit much half a foot in height and we'll create a component called display box or base display base we'll just duplicate that piece of geometry and then um scale it not proportionately and to create like a plinth and then we say make this component unique um and then we change the name from display base to display plinth or display column whatever you use and then what we should do is we should give the them each a color so we're going to give them a color and not a texture for now and we're going to use this gray or gray green this olive green and we going to use this um this burnt burnt Brown um so let's say make make unique texture oh my mouse has disappeared for a moment and let's make that a unique texture let's sample the green let go to this component stick the texture on that Tils horribly uh we'll do the same for the brown again that Tils here it doesn't tell that badly but what we're going to do is we're going to turn the texture image off and the same for our green uh so that it looks like a clean texture and then oh excuse me there and then the plinth we're going to place on top of the base and we're going to create a primary plinth and a secondary plinth so I'm going to make this shorter and then we're going to make that also a unique component and we'll call it display plen Das small so now we've got display BL small display plinth and display base so this we will now call display pl- large just so that we can make each component a little bit more descriptive and then we're going to display it in this store first and I already get the feeling that the base of course is way too small for either of the our Solutions so we're going to go to our tags we're going to hide the store window um so it's much easier to navigate through with the space the front location I like I just don't like the lack of depth so I'm going to scale that up to here and then in its width as well and then I get the impression that we actually have a little bit more space so let's create a slightly different environment we'll make a duplicate of our secondary base um and create a bit of a what shall we say it almost looks like the podium at the Olympics and they give everyone their medal let's put the window back okay now we have this this environment let's go to our components and to the home button to the standard components the sampler and let's [Music] use let's use some Mele as a um as an indication of height for people shopping and I get the idea that the plinths are a little bit low um so let's say that they come that the primary plinth comes up to smell's waste I don't know what that is exactly in millimeters or in feet SL in but as a visual indicator for how tall a human is well we're using um Sim today as our um as our appropriate average let's hide the windows again and then we can actually use the measuring tape to um to learn that that is 870 mm roughly so that is just under 3 ft that might be a bit tall but for now we're going to leave this and we're not going to download a um I'm not going to download a dolly created image for our hiking shoes our final product we're just going to go to the 3D warehouse and see if there is perhaps a hiking shoe I can shoot 3D model and um there are some models the filters turned on no all results three results in models that's actually really small if I just type in shoe no if I just type in hiking maybe hiking boot would be a more appropriate hiking boot instead of Sho okay a pair of hiking boots 12 megabytes 8,000 pieces of geometry that might be a bit big 12 megabytes for a component that has to be duplicated across multiple Stores um of course in Cas of 2024 and um and the upcoming 2025 let's delete these guides um hopefully you know the geometry count doesn't affect our model too much we can use all kinds of plugins to downsize geometry um so if you if you end up using this this model multiple times you perhaps want to want to purge some of the geometry here um and what we'll do for now is we'll just duplicate this component of hiking shoes and um and that's the way it would be displayed the only thing that we're missing now in our window is perhaps a call out or a campaign graphic um or maybe even a vinyl saying this is um this is our new catalog product so we want to dress this window up a little bit more and and I suppose because this is a hiking environment we could also change the the base of the we could change the color of the base to a texture we could do like Leaf material so we could do a vinyl with that um we could do maybe a piece of track um or a mud with some car tire profile in it on the front of the plinth um or some bootprints in soft soil all of these creative ideas we could start playing with but I don't want to take up too much of your time going through the creative let's rather keep our focus on the on a way of um illustrating the workflow so for now we're going to go back to C GP T and ask one last time um to create some um campaign images please create a campaign image or campaign background um wallpaper and then our second question is please create a um campaign campaign typing campaign slogan image okay perfect um we're going to uh refine the campaign slogan image and say please make the slogan uh image to a ratio of 4 to one which I hope it understands will make it four times as wide as its height because the current ratio looks like a 2X one that might be a little bit rough nope that really didn't work although what we can do is we can extract part of this image right we can ex extract this little strip and the strip below it we might as well so let's create an image out of this text and save that as a snip so we save that as campaign slogan one and then we're going to save that as campaign slogan 2 in the same manner sorry this snippet tool is a little bit com person slogan two yes it is our second image and then here uh do we prefer this image over the sorry the background do we prefer this image over that that image I think we're going to use this one for the simple sake that um that this doesn't have any text in it so we're going to go from left to right okay let's minimize that let's go back here and let's save this this will be campaign not slogan this will be campaign um wallpaper okay all right let's hide that Windows layer one last time and then amongst the color pallet we're now going to drag in from our dear desktop no not co-pilot from my desktop the wallpaper yes scale that down a little bit so that it sits nicely on the side and then the other images were campaign slogan one and campaign slogan 2 my spelling has atrocious okay all right so here are our images and our color pallet now if if we kept this as a little bit of a library as a bit of a as a bit of a template what we should do is we should copy that um that logo that we created back um this is all in the same plane and then let's use a skill tool to keep that roughly the same width so we've got a logo a color pallet a wallpaper and two campaign strips and let's explode this and Sample this as the campaign wallpaper yes all right so that we could now position directly against our back wall here and directly onto our LED screen um so the LED screen we're just going to paint the texture and we're not going to make it projected one moment and then in our position of the texture we're just going to match top and bottom or we're going to match the height let's match the height for now and then we're going to drag it over so that we don't see the edges of that texture where it looks a little bit like a rough wallpaper okay so that would be our buntu LED wall and then here we're going to do a vertical fabric frame okay so the digital element of course is not going to be a printed graphic that is going to be uploaded hopefully from a a media server in the cloud directly to each store the fabric frame however that sits here in the back that is something that we would have to create specifically for our campaign so we've got our window vinyls our floor vinyls our fabric banners and our Banner system um and we deleted that on um on purpose previously what just happened to sim did I oh I was unhiding everything it was it was changing the the outline of sim let's not focus on that all right so we've got the window and we have um our Banner behind our shoes so what we're going to do is we're going to draw a simple rectangle and Med step to the edges of our our base and we're just going to press the the left Arrow key to lock in our vertical axis and we're going to a we're going to do a um a size of 2200 mm in height and then we're going to push pull that fabric uh frame to be let's say about 40 mm thick um so that will be the size of our frame and then what I'm going to do is as my material I'm just going to select color um solid color let's select a gray um yeah let's select that gray and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete the front face and I'm going to paint inside the same color uh no I'm going to paint the inside white and I'll tell you why we're going to make this group group and a component and we're going to call this fabric frame and now if we create a um an image that sits in front of the frame and I make that a group if I now accidentally delete the image I still have the frame right so the frame in this in this store hopefully we won't destroy this Frame hopefully we will keep the ratio and the size of this Frame the same so we do a ones of instance ation of a permanent fabric frame and each time we can swap out the fabric um so the fabric I'll just move that um element forward and just give it a different color right so the fabric sits in the frame and the frame is a different component than the fabric so the fabric frame is a component called fabric frame we could make it a dynamic component we could make it a unique component so that in each or where we use the fabric frame we could um we could create different sizes of it but for now what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep it the same in every store um so here's also one of those fabric frames that we had earlier and I'm going to place this fabric frame here in the corner and then just rotate that to a line uh with my store here and then what I could do is I could take this this group that we have here and make it a component and call it fabric banner and then um we will sample that background texture that wallpaper go into our fabric Banner component make sure that that is also not projected and then change the position of our texture here and we're just going to go scale it to the full height maybe even a little bit bigger you know maybe we create a really abstract looking wallpaper we'll just zoom in on this little detail of the mountain and the stripes and then we're going to place it in the fabric frame either manually like I'm doing now or we can cut this component out and insert it into this component right if we do that if we insert it you'll see that in the other store it then also shows up if I didn't insert it keeping an eye on what we had here right then it removes it and now it is a physical object a free component that is not embedded in the other component uh but we do want to do that because it would make our life a lot easier so now we have two fabric components uh we have our plinths and we could do the same we could take the base and the short plinth we could make a copy of that we could go to the second store get them get the same angle right hopefully we need to unhide the windows just to see where the window ends here make that base not as deep and then move that plinth here let's say we have two plins um and then the shoe would be displayed here like that did I move that glass by accident earlier seems like it jumped out of place um let's put it back the way we hopefully I was about to say is this glued somewhere nope let's not focus our attention on that okay and and now we can we can actually do the same thing we can say no the product um is also going to be embedded in the component so let's lead that here um let's cut that and then go into this plinth let's make this a group so long and then paste well actually paste in place our boots and now we can see that between each store it updates the plinth with the product as well um to be visually the same so any plint that we now copy over into each store um should then reflect the same result so we can now really easily switching between campaigns if if we kept this plinth we should really easily show a different product on the plinth now that we have set up the model one after another with the same the same product and the same wallpaper now for some reason if you um see a store let's say this store where there's a lot less Windows space right we could also decide to only show one plinth um in each in each store uh we probably want to not have that at 45° that rotation seems to have been not exactly 45° let's bring it back to zero um so let's keep that plinth also in this in this window um as you can see what I'm doing each time is I'm scaling the plinths right so the plinth has a solid color and I'm simply scaling the plinth to accommodate our space um and here what we would probably do is not have two times the same plinth we should probably copy the large plinth here and then um stick that oh not here um and then stick that here on the on the same space and the windows as you can see the windows are getting in the way as a layer um when we're setting up the display units all right so there we go ubun TRS now has multiple plins in the window there's multiple um ways to dress up the store environment the shop the window itself and the only thing that we now need to do to sort of finish off the window look is perhaps install that final strip so there's a buntu trial um which will'll do as like strip one and strip two and then what we can do is um draw a rectangle and again let's lock that into the vertical axis so that we can make this strip let's say let's say that we make this strip the same in height for every store um so we make it two 250 mm in height so just under one foot and we can't put that strip directly in front of the of the shoes so either we mount it lower um or we mount it all the way to the top or actually we don't do it in front of that window we only do it in front of this window just using the scaling tool we will adjust the size and then again we're going to try and keep it similar um at a similar height as the as the top of the the tallest base the tallest Flint so that it's easy as a person to recognize it or maybe we go to shoulder height so that it's more in line with eye height and then we're going to make a group out of that and a component and we're going to call this component window vinyl one let's call that number one and then we're going to make a copy of that and um let's rotate at 90° and let's bring it up to the same height and then scale it to the corner um as you can see I mounted it in front of the glass you can bring it back to the glass don't make it sit exactly against the the glass keep it a few millimeters off so that the texture doesn't interfere with the with the glass because the vinyl doesn't have a thickness um and two textures on top of each other in SketchUp often creates a bit of um of an overlap and then and then they don't look they don't look proper so let's call this one let's make this unique let's make this a new component make it unique and call it final number two so we've got window final one and window finy two and then and we're going to take the buntu trials texture let's explode that and explode this going to take that texture apply it to our component here unprojected and the position to be adjusted let's use these handles to bring this in place and we're not going to fuss too much about the ratio of this graphic we want it to be exactly in our space um and we want the black stripes in there as well that was not a reference to the White Stripes okay that roughly brings can see the the bottom of the of the text coming through in the way that it tiles the texture so let's try to keep that out of view okay that's better so that is now trip one as distorted our image has become once we adjusted that proportion and then um image number two again let's adjust the projection and then the position of the texture there are all kinds of plugins to make this go a little bit faster and a little less um cumbersome but we're not we're just trying to stick to Native tools showing you that everything is possible in the basic the basic well not basic software but in the in the starter kit so to say and then these vinyls we can then also duplicate across the various stores so we can we have option one and option two um and here what we would probably do is do a step and repeat so we would have two vinyls next to each other to make up the full width and I'm not too worried about showing the vinyl exactly at the right size um for the time being we're still in this sort of early concept phase and our second [Music] vyl we actually are going to use it in the window here so what we'll do is we'll stick it here and um it's a bit skew so let let's align that actually with the window sill and then what we're going to do really horribly is we're going to just distort it we're not going to change the the size and the step and repeat of it and later on um if we get very technical we should make this a unique component that probably matches the the size of each window um so that each window joint is taken into account um and then when we operate in our um in our preferred image editing tool we can also set up the artwork for each store window to its exact size so that we can manipulate each artwork as it is relevant to each store for now the reason I'm not doing that is because I want to illustrate the the campaign to our client without spending too much time without spending too much time um having to update my model so if I want to show a really quick concept because each component here is now repeated it will update across all five stores without making these components unique to each stores Dimensions so now we have um logo the wallpaper our plins and our vinyl strips across these various stores uh we have our digital display we've got the the secondary option for this other store and then we have our third store now uh what we should do to make our installation process faster is we should um we should copy all the assets that we use in each Store to our um our sort of dtp space so let's hide the windows one last time and then what we're going to do is we're just going to align a copy um of these products and I'll show you how this works or how this operates and I'm trying to snap to the same point that that I know they sit all in the same location and and this last one is graphic and I'm going to put the graphics in um in the same location and I'm going to lay them flat on the ground so that you can see them really easily create a bit of space between them and then I'm going to put the the logo the light box also flat on the ground all right so that all sits next to each other maybe left aligned if we are really finicky a little bit more space here all right if we now go to a top view and we look at this then we can see what we are installing for the store we are introducing a new light box we've got a sensor met we've got our base and we've got our finyl uh we haven't shown our three plants and we should really do that as well and then um we can lay that flat and then we go back to that top view we can now see all the product for this store in in a row maybe it would be better to put the the plint on top schematically on top of the the plint sorry on top of the base but for now we'll leave it like this and then what we're going to do for the campaign is we're going to introduce a new tag and we call this product and then of course I'm going to put our hiking boots in the product layer and then I'm going to turn product off I'm going to switch my camera to parallel projection and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a scene and call this dtp store 3 or as an abbreviation dtp S3 okay so now I've got um store 3 as my as my store View and then dtp S3 as my overview of all the elements that I'm going to print or manufacture this is perhaps not the best way to switch between scenes because this is store one and we were looking at store three just now um so let's go back to scene one where we were looking at this first store and then we have all our elements here um so what we'll do is we'll say this is indeed dtp but it is rename dtp store one and then let's move this um this scene left there we go so now we can swap between our store our physical View and our dtp for the sake of time because I feel like we are we have been recording for an hour now for the sake of time we're not going to go through all the other stores as well I hope that the that the component use um shows itself beneficial to you um across the various stores so far uh we're just going to go to layout and layout this specific store um in a layout overview so that we can share that with our client and our manufacturing team and we're going to do that on a blank canvas layout file um we want to save our model first we don't want to purge anything as of yet we can leave that for later all right I'm going to choose a template genuinely for installation teams um using the the A1 paper is probably the easiest so we'll use a title block oh sorry not A1 um generally A4 excuse me generally A4 is the simplest template to use and we can do a cover page we can do a cover page for the region that we're operating in the province or the state um or we can do a CO cover page that uh amplifies the specific campaign that we're working on um however for this project what we'll do is the project title we've got that as an automatic text um so in our document setup we can go to auto text we can call the project name project title we'll call it Ubuntu Ubuntu uh spring launch great and then the author name um we'll call it basically the store um or no actually we'll just do the brand so to okay and I left a space in there no that is looking a bit weird um okay that should yeah that's that's probably that space and there was making the text um uncentered um and then the project location unfortunately is not a tag but it should be a tag so let's make a tag out of it that's project location and then file document setup auto text um let's duplicate project title and then call that project location yeah location and then we'll call it store one and we need to remove the space here there we go store one then what we're going to do with our scene is we're going to keep this scene that we set up specifically for our manufacturing team we're going to set that up here and we're just going to zoom in on that collection of items then we're going to duplicate our viewport and we're going to change it from scene dtp1 to scene one which is store one and it doesn't adjust the camera angle so we'll go to our SketchUp menu on the right hand side and say viewport reset all okay that gives us the correct view smele is also still here we should probably hide her under a tag called people um and then we'll zoom in like this we're not going to install the digital screen so that's not important so what we can do is we can change the angle a little bit just so that we can see that vinyl here on the left um so that everything that has to be installed for this project is visible in one overview if it's not visible in one overview of course we can also create multiple viewports in the same space so to illustrate that real quickly let's position our camera here and then let's position our camera back at the front and now you can see that the Clutter that I've left in this in this model in the way that I've arranged what's hidden and visible um of course should be refined a bit because we don't want to see it that messy um so that you can you can make sure that all these scenes are preset together with your layout file a little bit more precisely but for now um just going to keep these two as two separate viewports and now we have um an overview of what we're going to manufacture and hopefully a good visual indication of where this is in the store and then we can draw a um a simple rectangle here and we need to create perhaps another layer um yeah like this and this would be our description text box space um like a stamp or a document um Legend and then we can create automated text so we can create a label right that describes the the automated text that might speed up up some part of our workflow or we can create um individual text and if we create individual text maybe what is then best to do is to create little um little guides or little Snippets so we can create a um a text box here oh must type something in it so we'll just type in the number one the number two the number three the number four and the number five and then we will uh fill the space fill the space with let say the color orange and then the text we will Center it and anchor it centered and we should probably make it um bolt text yeah let's actually delete these because the style style is more important in this case let's let's do an outline and maybe we should Dash it no let's leave it normal and this is then item one so we can go to our Legend here and say this is item one that corresponds with the viewport here and that then corresponds with the description here so whe excuse me whether that description sits here uh together with the guide right so the text now it's here and then what we can do is we can um we can say that the stroke um can we remove the stroke I think we can um let's not fuss about with that for now what we can do is we can say that the logo of the the logo the light box logo is always going to be the same regardless so we can say um light box um and then hopefully we know the dimension of it which I will now just do off the top of my head um in meters light box is um 1,800 mm wide by 900 mm High um vinyl to be applied for each uh campaign and maybe that text I should put in italics as a special reference and then a little bit smaller so everything fits on one line and then this we could copy over um so five times and then this of course becomes number two this number three this number four this number five and then hopefully this then gives us a good indication to say this is item two this is item three this item four and this is item five and the large one would be item six and then we can predefine each of these um can predefine each of these texts and these items and then depending on the I'm just going to give each viewport a stroke so that's a little bit easier to see what is what excuse me and let's copy that style to here and here yeah and let's meet up these lines um so this gives us a bit of an overview and now in the in the stics in the base in the in the strip of artwork in these two scenes we now have the um the window tag missing so let's go to store and turn that back on okay that's better uh one two 3 four then light box need to change these names I'm doing track uh number five and number six and then what I see we we didn't do in our model was the fabric in the back so that would be number seven and here we call this fabric night box um toall plint and hopefully these names won't change um as you might use multiple objects um the same campaign uh window vinyl but if they do change then then it's probably better to make this auto text or um or label text so that it updates as you update the the component object base um security gate okay and then number seven that light box that was our object that was missing um so let's introduce that and stick that in the same spot and it would probably be neat to make sure that it sits relatively in the same location right so this this whole row should fit in front of the same store so that while you're working in the model everything is easily accessible within the same frame of thinking and then we'll save that and it will update here but that means unfortunately that it won't allow us to show the same amount of information um and it yep there it reenders that's great it should show like that so now most of our text has jumped out of place a little bit so you want to create a bit of of a system here to make sure that things don't go flying around um all the time but once this system is locked into place and you've set up your tags and your layers pretty consistently you shouldn't have to change too much between campaigns and experience hopefully a lot more efficiency so now everything is labeled maybe the colors are a little bit too bright or a little bit too um too inyour face in a schematic like this so you should simply um label and name them um but only make them with a yellow outline in the in the 3D view so that the document is still readable and you um you can work your way through the document without feeling that the colors are screaming at you and then this probably can align it a little bit better so I'm sure that there are many more ways with all kinds of other components and layering techniques to automate even a little bit more of this process but for a first time starting to set this up this really does tend to give you a good overview and now this is probably a good page for someone working in um in the installation process right it gives you an overview of where each item sits in the store know that this is store one um this is the front and the side window these are the items to be installed or to be manufactured uh these are the seven uh descriptions and Technical information of what substrate and material we're using here if we duplicated this page and we deleted this text box and this bottom overview and maybe even we deleted um the numbers here on the window then these two viewports combined they could show really easily to the client what um what this store will look like um so let's zoom out a little bit look at the store like this and this closeup we can we can maintain or maybe even we should make the closeup you know maybe half the size and then duplicate that close up and then really zoom in on um on product placement right so here on our on our boots maybe maybe there's a detail that sits on top of the plinth that's really interesting a specific texture or piece of um designed artwork so here we've got a quick overview of the color usage the material usage maybe material uses is really important for our client um so let's change this View port to take up about half the space and then duplicate that viewport here and then what we going to do is adjust the camera to you know that um that material overview let's go out of perspective make sure we look at the top that gives us a nice flat overview and then what we can do is we can maybe even make this a little bit smaller um oh and duplicate that viewport and then scroll up a bit to show the the artwork specifics so now we can show a campaign overview to our client to our marketing manager and say look here's a store overview here's a detail of the window a detail of the product these are the colors we want to use in this campaign and this is the art we use in this campaign so so it feels more like a mood board um out of all things then um then an installation guide and there's a there's a big difference between this kind of page overview and this kind of page overview in the in the type of information that you're trying to Showcase to a different team but we're still using the same model we're we're using the same digital twin of the store and we're using the same campaign elements it's just that different parts of the information are shown and and different level of detail is given to different types of information so that gives us a good overview between uh Team marketing and team installation to make use of the same layout file now you could rearrange your pages um so you could print out page 1 to three or page 1 to 7 for your stores and then page 8 to 14 for your installation guide right still showing the same information across multiple scenes multiple platforms um so that in short um I don't want to take up another hour that in short is a um is a overview of how to use digital twins for your storefront windows with a um with a a madeup campaign extracted onto layout for um for your different manufacturing installation and creative teams using the same information I hope that this I hope that this Workshop has given you um a clear indication of what SketchUp layout um and um yeah what sketch and layout are capable of for the retail industry I hope that this um within your own retail environment gives you a good idea of what you can do using simple techniques like components layering uh tags uh different scene views to create a workable digital space digital twin space in which you can really rapidly create um creative interactive campaigns come up with wonderful ideas without feeling like you're being held back um by the way that you need to demonstrate this to to your teams so for now um let's move away from these documents and for one last moment go back to our presentation and um let's recap everything that we went through today so you've been shown that with a with a clear strategy for auditing and surveying your retail locations you can create a comprehensive overview of all the different storefront windows that you have between your retail locations um you can use all of the that information in a shared Cloud space to give access to your own team team and to teams outside of your team to that information um so that everyone can comprehend and understand the differences between the various retail locations um I've shown you how you can use your tags and your components to create your master file with all your different stores together to focus on the storefront windows um I've shown you how you can organize your layout file for sharing between your clients and your manufacturing and installation um and I've shown you that using this audit installation and Crea a feedback um framework you can fine-tune your campaigns and make really quick updates to all your different graphical elements um and all your props by using um components and and these Master files as a as a technique so that is all for this Workshop um if you have any questions or things you would like to discuss I refer you back to the YouTube comments and um and the Trimble platforms um if you want to reach out to me personally you can do that on LinkedIn um my name is Josh de brown and um for all the resources that I used
