and and thank you all for coming this afternoon uh it's a it's a pleasure to share some of our work and um I I I I can tell from a lot of blue lanyards in here that I think we have folks from the The Wider Trimble Universe than just SketchUp folks but I'd love to see a show of hands does anyone in here operate laser scanners as part of their work great so I'll tell you right off the bat um I'm not going to train on anything uh in terms of how to use um Point Cloud software but I am going to show you a lot of detail about how we use it as part of our workflow and including the scan Essentials plugin and um you know just getting evidence collected in a variety of ways and putting it into a SketchUp model to learn more about crime scenes and forensics and there are other opportunities to get training on the scan chil plugin at SketchUp 3D base camp so that's out there but today we're going to talk mainly about forensics and what we do at fat pencil Studio to um you know to really understand those stories so let me tell you briefly about myself uh before we jump in any further um first of all fat pencil studio if you haven't heard of us we are a design firm based in Portland Oregon and we specialize in using visual stories to help attorneys and other legal professionals make a better case and my background is in civil engineering and architecture so I I think when I mention to people that I draw crime scenes for a living they kind of say well how' you do that transition that's a bit strange and it really came down to uh the work that I was doing at first when I started fat pencil Studio back in 2004 um was primarily real estate work and that all went away in 2007 so um because of the recession and I had to scramble a little bit and find other things to do and I actually had a chance to uh work for some diagrams on an eminent domain case for the first time and just some really crude Google Earth uh renderings of different assumptions about massing for a building and how that related to the value of a property the uh Economist that I was working for felt like that would be a little bit easier for a jury to grasp than his spreadsheets that he was working with and so what the upshot of that though is he introduced me to his clients at the Portland city attorney's office and we got to work uh together on a civil rights case uh which was um a man it was tackled in the middle of the street and ended up dying in the back of a police car very bad political case for the city and um they and a lot of witnesses of this event although because it was 2009 strangely the only photographic evidence that Witnesses produced was this this one picture uh of the scene and we were able to though create a 3D model to both map in what we learned from from that photograph and also more importantly use it in real time with the city to help understand what Witnesses might have seen from a different perspective as we it's set up for use in federal court see if I can get out of this here and go to SketchUp and and we we had it set up with the evidence presentation in federal court if you need to put the uh camera at a particular location where the witness says they were we can zoom down to that location and ask what if this is what they saw they might say yeah that's right but you know that squad car I don't think that had gotten there yet we can hide that we can move people over a little bit if they had a different position all this is able to do in real time I thought we were going to do it mainly in court it turned out we used it dozens of times with uh Witnesses with other parties with risk management and ultimately they settled the case um on the eve of jury selection but this case really opened my eyes to the potential for how useful these kinds of tools can be working on court cases so fast forward to today uh we're located in Portland Oregon like I said uh it's on if you're familiar with the city we're on Northeast Sandy Bard just about a mile from downtown and we have nine people on staff now a mixture of experience between art film architecture construction and actually five of those people are here with us set base camp so if you see any of these folks in the hallway please say hello for me um we work on a whole bunch of different types of cases nearly a thousand since we started doing legal work in 2009 so that's civil cases anything from um you know personal injury to medical malpractice and civil rights and on criminal cases we've done things as small as DUI and certainly uh done capital murder cases as well so what I'm going to talk about today is visual stories and I'm going to focus on three elements of how we go about creating those stories the first I'm going to talk thing about is is scanning and also other ways of capturing data and then what do you do when we get that into SketchUp and finally um say some words about um accuracy and admissibility in court because if if you're talking about litigation there's always a chance that things that would produce are going to need to be used in court and we have to be prepared uh to support that and and for these to have foundation for admissibility and I've got lots of case studies and I will say we're pretty small group here so at any time if you have questions just raise your hand and I'd love to address it then and we'll have a couple minutes for questions at the end as well so let's talk first about scanning and what does that produce and this is from a case we uh we're actually using reality capture software to process the point Cloud for this case and you can see the inside of a house here and right away if you're if you're used to looking at Point clouds you kind of understand what you're looking at and you know you can see a crime SE with some placards but it's not always easy if you're not used to looking at point of clouds to know what you're looking at and in particular this this point was driven home to me uh for the first time I went to um some crime scene reconstruction conferences for the A acsr and also the ifsm which is a forensics professionals all folks that do laser scanning I saw some incredible work that people were doing documenting crime scenes sometimes shootings that happen over the course of multiple blocks and I went up to some of them at lunch and said you know these are so great as far as documenting what happened in this incident you know how are the attorneys using it you know when you bring it to the DA what do they do with it and the guy's like well they don't really know what to do with it you know they come look at it on our computer and then they then they go away and do their their work and maybe we show it in court um but you know part of the reason for that well there's three really three reasons one is a is a technology Gap so you have all the files associated with these scans that are living on your computer and then you got to get them into sort of the you know the the the cloud and the evidence um uh and you would get it over to the attorneys and and they don't know what all these files are they can't open them on their computer it might be several gigabytes or more worth of information so as a a barrier as far as just the technology goes to having other folks working on these cases understand and use this material and then there's a big difference as far as expertise too and so we'll have a little test here I want to know um well first of all is anyone in this room a doctor or radiologist okay so if you're not a radiologist does anyone know what we're looking at heart okay what was your clue about this is a heart right yeah that helps a little bit right what about this that helps a little bit more and and so you know if you don't give people a clue what they're looking at with these Point clouds it can be very difficult to um figure out and have some context for it and then the final Gap that exists between what you collect as far as the raw data at a crime scene and how you might use this with a case is a storytelling aspect because as great as a software is at collecting and registering Point clouds and measuring and maintaining accuracy there's a question about how easy is it to layer in the storytelling elements I know there's some capabilities with that we found that SketchUp is a great tool for not only adding things to a crime scene but also adjusting uh in real time the positions of those things looking at it from different perspectives understanding visibility and ballist and uh trajectories and that sort of thing so those are the three reasons that we've decided that SketchUp is really great for um our purposes to help bridge that expertise Gap from the data that was collected to using it with um with legal teams and I want to share this first case study which is um an incident that happened in a home um in Oregon a gentleman had come from out of state to colle on a bad debt um was was hoping to get the money or at least the enough drugs worth the money and it was kind of a home invasion type of situation they're in a standoff and we had this good laser scan of the house and it allowed us to correct collect some critical measurements you'll see why this is important in a moment and let me switch over to that model now so here's the house and what had happened is yellow guy just came back and implied that he just offed uh the son of orange orange guy and and and blue woman and um that uh did not go over well and the uh orange guy confronts the guy that a gun this guy in teal and reaches for the gun and ends up sort of pushing him down and then there's a shot fired and there's these Witnesses here and green guy says this is what I saw here green guy said he saw this square up shoot him right in the head and then orange guy goes down and uh that's where they found him at the scene so the the story of the guy in teals is is different of course he says okay I was actually hitting against this door jam and the way we got that information is because we went in with the defense team to uh visit at the jail where he was being held and it's one thing to sort of explain it in a few words but it was a lot easier to get the detail when we could look at it in closeup and actually move things around so for example we have on the back of um see if I can turn on our our handles here so these these mannequins all have points that can be adjusted so if I need to in real time change a position of the hand we can do that per the direction of a person that we're working with it's not easy to do a lot of fine detail like making fists and that kind of thing in the moment but because we can make a lot of those adjustments in real time it enables us to get more information and then ultimately to prepare diagrams that can be used to tell that story okay so I going to talk a little bit about why we favor draw redrawing these these models when in theory we already have a 3D model if you've scanned the scene right like why would you redo that if you've already scanned it and you've scanned it so accurately and what it comes down to is that um you know just because you have the scan doesn't necessarily mean you understand the space and one of the things I learned in architecture school is there's value in in drawing a space you know even even in retracing floor plans from a building that you've you know that's already been designed you learn things and certainly when you work on your own design you learn things and that design process is often more valuable than what the end product is so as it as that kind of fits into our philosophy of forensics is such that you know by creating this Digital model you then have a tool that you can map out what you know and look at it from different perspectives in a way that's easy to collaborate with a a large number of people and one of the things that became clear to us early on is that it's great if you have a point cloud and you can measure off that but you don't necessarily need to have scanned a scene in order to have a 3D model so I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the data sources that we rely on when we're creating a model of a scene and oftentimes we we you know we use more than one so of course for this model that we're going to look at this case study we're going to see a house you can look at Google Street View and see in different years what that looked like from the street we make um quite a bit of use of a company called near map and they have aerial photos just like you can grab aerial photographs with the ad location feature using SketchUp it's also possible to import these near map photos we like them because they tend to be a little bit higher resolution and they're definitely more frequent um revisits to to their flights so we have a couple options per year sometimes more and in big cities to choose from that'll get us close to the date of the actual event and also sometimes the Shadows are different different days and you can see different things based on what was what was the shadows in the aerial photograph on that day if there's a police report there's sometimes diagrams that were drawn um of the inside of a house that can be really helpful in terms of determining the layout of rooms although they're often not to scale so you can't really rely on the measurements uh we watch body cam video quite a bit now of the first investigation of the scene again it's not going to be things you can measure off of but it does tell us how the rooms in a house are arranged which is pretty helpful and then if we do get to visit the scene even if there was no scan done we can go in with a tape measure and collect the the measurements that we'll need to um create a model we can take photographs that are useful to us as far as in terms of you know maybe there's less clutter in the house than there was on the the day of the crime maybe we can take sort of elevation straight on shots ultimately we're going to figure out how how can we learn as much as we need to learn to make a the best model we can make given the information we have so one of the things we use is architectural standards and if we know for example the height of a door and the door is in the same plane as a window we can scale off of this Photograph to figure out how tall that window is and there's a lot of things in a building that you'd be surprised you might know the size of and I'm just curious if we could brainstorm a little bit here uh what some of those things are so you know I said doors you know doors in residentials often 6'8 and usually like uh 30 in for interior or 36 in for exterior doors typical I mean it's not every do is like that but you know you get that's that's common what else is a standard that you might know and you know to chime in if you could think of anything in a building that's you know you see it in a photograph you probably know the size of it stairway stairway okay and what are some common things for stairways 48 in 48 in wide and then you know there's variety of sort of rise run that it could be but you know if you if you if you're if you're thinking about it it's probably six or so maybe seven depending on um so it could be like 711 rise and run or something similar could be 612 what else sofit so how much do those stick out typically 24 24 18 okay say again ceing height ceiling height what's typical for that yeah those are nice houses I I see s foot a lot in where there's crime scene you know but that's just the quality of the construction s to 7 to 9 fet is very typical um what else counter height counter height okay how much 30 in okay anything else CMU how big is CMU concrete masonry Unit 8 by 16 I spent lots of time counting CMU in the wall to figure out how wide or tall it is anything else I'll put in appliances like anything you can look up a serial number on and you're pretty sure you know what that is you know that could be that could be useful so there's a lot of stuff that you'll see in photographs that you'll give you a clue on how big things are and um ultimately when you were able when you when you put that into uh I add a couple other things on here I wanted to mention as potential sources so if the house has been sold you probably can go online the red fin or Zillow or trul a one of these real estate sites and find photos of that house maybe not right when the crime was committed but the rooms probably didn't change yes oh okay uh okay uh and that's been really helpful for us you know sometimes we're asked to make a model of a house that we can't visit and we don't have any photographs of but there's still a lot that can be done based on what you can find online as a starting point and so in this particular house let me put pull this up now so there's that that that unit it's a quarter of that that larger building that I showed you before we were able to place all this furniture it's not super detailed it's really there mostly for context like you know I don't really care how deep the sink was for example it's just to know that there was a kitchen there and that there's a bathroom here and um most importantly in this house when when we get these guys coming in and we'll just kind of look at the full sequence here knocking at the door confronting blue guy and they Corner him in the bedroom while the other guy over here is holding uh this guy burnt orange guy with a gunpoint you know are they seeing what's happening in the bedroom uh because if there you know if this guy says well I I I saw that this uh you know that that uh my roommate you know went after him he's he's not going to see anything in the bedroom from there and so it's a way to help understand the um you know the potential scenarios that might have happened and then use that to determine a strategy for how you want to pursue the case what additional evidence do you need where what can you have your investigators talk to Witnesses about ultimately if you do go to trial what do you what's your Str strategy for cross- examination on different Witnesses and then um you know how do you want to explain the story so that it's a little bit more credible than what might come out in words uh we work on cases a lot where the witness might not be all that credible but they do want someone to testify to avoid getting kind of mixed up and telling a convoluted story having a series of images to explain can be a much more helpful way to tell a story to the jury so in this case machete guy is uh chasing out and then catches blue guy in the head and then ultimately they kill him here on the ground and then orange guy gets up and runs so that's the the the sequence of events for that but having you know developing that was really useful with the team of attorneys and investigators to make sure that they understood what the big picture of this case was and figure out do they want to advide their client to take a plea deal is there a reasonable chance of getting other witnesses to uh to impeach them on the stand that kind of that goes kind of questions um so part of the job was getting the apartment model accurately because you need to have that accuracy to know that it's a re a credible story and when you when you want to see if you could see something from a certain spot that that's a reasonable thing to do but part of it is also laying in these movable elements the human figures the weapons if it's an outside thing there's often cars where did the cars come into the play so those are all items that we'll need to talk about uh when we get to the next section but first I want to talk a little bit about what do we do with Point cloud data if we when we do get that because oftentimes we don't have it at the beginning but we'll get it soon and how do we bring that into the the uh the case so I'm going to look for a bit at this uh um case study where we're talking about an event that happens um in a residential neighborhood there was shots fired from a small attic uh that end up striking um a uh neighbor in the house and we had a lot of laser scans for this project you can see there was dozens and we have for a long time used um Autodesk recap mainly as a way to take scans that come from different vendors um Trimble phoh um Leica is not great for opening and recap but you know be trying to get scans from different places and figure out how do we get those registered if they are not already registered how do we crop it down to what we need we can adjust the um the the point size as we need to and do things like measure from side to side for this case we needed to know how far apart the houses were and more critically like what's the difference in elevation and then another great thing to do um and you can do this in your native uh Trimble software real works or you could do it um you know in a program like uh recap is being able to jump into these orbs where there's a 360 photo taken and then measure off of um something that's a little bit more um highdea as far as the materials of the the structure as opposed to just looking at a point cloud and then of course at any time you can jump back into the 3D Point cloud and you know check different perspectives so that's sometimes where we start with Point cloud data but then we're often going to export that data in the e57 format so that we can bring it into uh the scan Essentials plugin for SketchUp studio and a few of the things that we do with that you can see you can import the data you can change the opacity of that point cloud data so you're seeing and how that appears in relation to the geometry in your 3D model um it's pretty easy to draw a a bounding box and then bring that over to the area of your model that you want to crop in although we notice that um sometimes that the Bounty box might be different than the edges of the geometry and so it takes you know takes a a little um finessing to get that right and then once you've got that loaded and registered with your model it's possible to um yeah you can move the points around a little bit to you know fine-tune it and get it to to match up with your geometry or you might be starting with points and then modeling geometry on top of the 3D Point Cloud one thing to keep in mind as you do that is while you can snap to all the points in your point Cloud as you're drawing they're not necessarily coper those points they might be close to c-l planer but they're probably not exactly coper so that's where you might need to use other tools U one thing that we've used a little bit is this ground mesh um workflow where you can create um uh like a ground mesh that matches the terrain which is pretty good although you know if there's sort of clutter um you you end up with some of these Mounds somewhere that that are actually the um artifacts of you know tree stumps or other stuff that's not necessarily the ground but there's a lot of good stuff in here to work with if you want to have material that you have in a point Cloud as a guide for the work that you're going to do in SketchUp and depending on the project sometimes we do this right away other times we might feel like it's easier to just model based on other resources and then check the point Cloud measurements for specific uh important measurements and then for this project for this case the big deal was okay so this guy's in his attic uh firing a rifle into over at the neighbor's house you can see all the bullet strikes on the neighbor's house we kind of zoom in here and the question is was he intending to try to kill someone in there because he's charged with attempted murder or is this just a guy with a mental crisis is in his attic firing a weapon indiscriminately and unfortunately the neighbor got hit and one of the things we needed to understand is what is the story that the neighbor told about where they were and what could the guy in the Attic have seen from his window and that's where we ended up with this um diagram because the neighbor indicates they came out of their back bedroom and were walking toward the front door at the time they got hit whereas the view from the attic really covered just the kitchen area and so right away even though we did this model without originally having a point Cloud we kind of knew that it was pointing towards there's no possible way that the shooter could have seen the person that that got hit uh because that was not the area of the house they were in um one thing and let me just um go ahead and bring that up so we can look at it a little more carefully so with these um let's find the cursor there it is so we didn't know the shooter's position and that's this is a good question about what data could we use to place the shooter's position um sometimes we work with Ballistics experts and they might have an opinion let's say for a particular argument if a shotgun was fired and you see a pattern of pellet strikes they might have an opinion on the distance from which that pattern was created uh but in this case with a rifle you know you probably could have made those marks from a variety of places in that attic maybe they would look at the bullet holes and have a suggestion on what angle those shots were fired from but that wasn't really the question that was being asked in this case so mostly it was for illustration purposes understanding that he's going to be up here somewhere looking through the window and the question was what are his sight lines um because that was the you know the attorneys were mainly interested in could can we get the attempted murder charge dropped and then negotiate a pleague deal around the rest of it um and one of the big deals it's like okay where is this window in relation to this window here so that was the kinds of things we were very interested in and when we got the pointcloud we were adjusting those aspects of the model to be more accurate just to make sure that it didn't change the answer but because of the the distance between this front doorway and where this view box is going to be we kind of knew it early in the case that it was not going to be a possibility of seeing someone in the hallway just based off of uh even the slightly lower accuracy of creating a model with with no point cloud data but it's not it's a common thing we would do is just start and then when we get the higher accuracy data figure out what do we need to adjust to answer the questions as accurately as possible um any other questions about sort of this setup on this case study one of the things that we do a lot of is you know mapping out bullet strikes we have a a handy um Dynamic component that we created for evidence markers both um these little placards that sit on a wall and also these um the oh this one just uses placers too but we have we have sort of um uh triangular placards that stand up by themselves and it's handy to be able to just drop those in and then you can go in and um into here and change the the nomenclature um so the question is if if we had photos of the evidence markers um what do we try to do to match those in this case I think they actually measured out the location of the bullet strike so we use those measurements if they don't then we're going to work with the photos and you know what what do we see in that photo that provides some reference that we can locate that evidence marker sometimes it's a stripe in a parking lot sometimes it's counting the number of um you know uh Planks on the siding and you know we're going to get as close as we can but then ultimately we what we want to be able to do is also have those photos handy so if we're going to mark this with a we probably have a folder of photos somewhere where we can label it marker a and when the discussion happens and this is really the value of doing this work early in case is that you get the attorney and the investigators the criminalist you know the forensic expert whoever on a call together they need to discuss it they want to be able to see these things and understand and not have to hunt through 250 500 photographs to find it and so you know having that all set up and organized is really a benefit in terms of getting uh progress made on the cases and I was just going to show like you can these These are these Dynamic components we have a thing where you can go in and change um the option so if we wanted to have a different color here we can make that you know white and then we can change the letter to a you know a j so it's just a quick way of matching up with what what you see in the scene and um we we we're hoping at some point to add a feature to this where you could actually include media in those markers as well like a photograph like a video and SketchUp doesn't make it real easy to have internal links out of those to reference a photo set somewhere but we're working on it so if anyone knows a way to do that feel free to um come over and talk to me afterwards because that's that's definitely a would be a useful tool for us to not have to maintain a directory on our computer somewhere uh and then you know bring those up separately but actually be able to offer this uh with an online Link and have the media already embedded would be a really great um extra feature to add okay so now um I want to talk a little bit about admissibility and one of the things that we always start with is what a judge would start with if they are ruling on whether something is admissible to be shown in court and that is is it relevant accurate and fair so most of the times the work we're going to be doing is relevant but there's a question about the accuracy and you know there could be any number of things that uh are used to measure a site but one thing I I always push back against if I get cross-examined on it and someone will say how do you know this is exactly right and I would say it's definitely not exactly right because there is no such thing as exact every measurement tool is going to have some level of precision associated with it and the important question is not necessarily how precise is it the question is is it precise enough to answer the question that's being asked and so that's always the mindset we're going to go in with and you know part of the great thing about doing the 3D model work and drawing at yourself is you know necessarily is going to tell you actually can I answer the question that's being asked with this level of precision or do we need to go out and get more information or maybe tell the attorney hey I understand you would like this to be true but the reality is it's not beyond the margin of error for this particular measurement method and so that's going to have to be the answer that happens a lot with video footage by the way um you know where you see this grainy video footage and they say oh I can definitely see him with the gun well you're going to have to find that evidence elsewhere because that you know sort of you know pixelated shape it could be anything it could be a gun it could be lots of stuff and so you know it's always a question about how precise is the me information you're working with and will it answer the question so when we go in and prepare material for court and really even from the beginning we had these questions in mind are we using the best information available if there's a laser scan we want to see it we want to see if there's anything in there that we could use it use but if we don't have that what else can we use to help answer those questions and then this this came up before how do we know where that person with a rifle is anything time there's a a movable object that wasn't in the scan what's our basis for knowing where that object is and the uh the final piece is is like I was mentioning do we have enough accuracy to answer the question and being able to know what the margin of error for any given measurement method is and therefore um make a decision about whether it's a reasonable way to answer the question for this case like I said we modeled it once at the beginning of the case when we did not have a laser scan and you'll see that on the left of your screen um and then we model it again with the laser scan and we can do this like uh this puzzle what what do we see as far as differences here the roof shape I saw you making that motion what else is different car position the car position and it's I think the car is a little bit bigger on the right your window size the window size and position yeah that's that's the three big ones deck looks wider on the the deck is wider we'll zoom in on that yep so narrow the deck a little bit change the window size and position so what's that yeah what is that let's see so we got a I think that was a refrigerator there and then I don't know if this is a barbecue um This falls into the category of if we looking at the point Cloud we would know exactly what it was um so we wanted to represent something there that took up that space but it wasn't really part of the story and what we are often doing is putting in enough detail to understand the story but we don't want to put in too much detail to be distracting and to like especially if it's if we put the details incorrectly and people someone points out that that's wrong it's the wrong brand of Grill or whatever um you know so the like when you see us putting people in these models um they're very low detail so they might be gendered male or female they might be a specific height but beyond that there's not a lot of detail then there's no face there's no ears there's no muscles there's no you know fat um and then the problem and we often get asked oh can you make this person like a you know uh you know 54 250 you know I'm like no we're not going to do that because we don't really have a good way to represent that accurately it's going to start to look creepy if we just try to I mean like we could yeah we could we could make this person um you know I could sort of start to like you know change their their it's going to look weird um and you know there's lots of really talented animators at Studios like Pixar that do a great job at making human figures look pretty darn convincing and I guarantee you they have a bigger budget than what we do for for their work so um you know and beyond that we just don't know oftentimes like you know one of the things we'll do on cases when we have injuries that are um present in a particular um victim is map the injuries onto the body if there's a entry and exit wound we will'll put a rod through and then once we have that in place we can pose that person and work with a ballistics expert who has the proper expertise to testify about that to figure out what position might they have been in at the time the shots were fired but you know do we know exactly what the the length of somebody's forearm is probably not we don't have a scan of their body so we have to do the best we can with the information we have available which is often times notes in a medical examiner report photos of an autopsy and that's still going to be more helpful than not having it at all because we can use those images with the ballist with the forensic experts with the attorneys to come up with that scenario that seems likely to them of where this person was when those shots were fired or what sequence the shots were fired in what so okay so end result if this witness had said I was in the kitchen washing dishes and I got shot in the side then it would be likely that this you know this could have been a potential attempted murder situation especially if all the shots had been right around that window um but because the witness didn't say that and because all the shots were sort of scattered everywhere the attorneys in this case were able to get that attempted murder charge um removed and then work with on a on a plea bargain to get this thing uh settled without having to go to trial and that's a lot of the work we do we do end up going to trial I testify sometimes in trial but most cases settle and there's a there's a huge value in doing this work even if your side doesn't necessarily like the answer that it comes up with it can help you know get two sides closer to Mak an agreement and I've got a few things I wanted to say in conclusion but we have some time for questions and I'd love to yeah go ahead on that um do you have to provide your model to both prosecutor independ so the question is do we have to provide this model to the both the prosecutor and the defense and the answer is it depends um it depends on a lot of things for one thing it depends on the jurisdiction because different jurisdictions state and federal have different rules about Discovery and um you know there might be a need you know sometimes you have you know depositions or expert Discovery or reports that are required and then you know we may end up showing at least if if not the entire model a series of exports of what we would be prepared to testify about if we if it went to trial and have that disclosed well in advance other states like Oregon they don't have the same level of requirement for disclosing every bit of you know you know of opinion that you would test T ify about or every bit of of work that you testify about in advance but if you don't disclose it in advance you're run a higher uh risk of just getting objections and then the judge having to make kind of a snap judgment about whether this kind of new fangled thing that they've never seen before is going to be allowable and maybe you don't want that uncertainty maybe it's better to you know figure out what's the the most complete way you could disclose this you know this information to the other side early in that there's a a chance to work out any differences about whether it's going to be if and how it's going to be used uh in in trial um but I want to just elaborate on that on one more point and that is the model itself you know do we discl do we send the model itself and the answer is sometimes yes um there's no reason we've we've you know put the SketchUp file in uh uh you know a disclosure or Discovery to the other side along with a link to the SketchUp viewer so they can have a way to look at it and then they can decide how how much they want to use that you know maybe they have somebody that um that understands the stuff that could you know do a lot of stuff with it but most likely they just say okay that's nice they've got a 3D model and then they think about how whether that's important for the points that they want to make in court and and go from there uh there was one case where I actually this was a bus crash case in Las Vegas and the attorney really wanted to do this kind of Real Time 3D modeling during uh direct examination in trial so he could kind of talk to the jury about various scenarios and and have the bus and the bicycle that got hit moving around as he went through those scenarios and they had a big discussion with the you know judge and opposing councel about this and then ultimately the the ruling was okay plff attorney you can do that as long as you give defense attorney the same opportunity to question Mr Cohen in the same way so I had the fun sort of two-hour live modeling session uh during court but I'll tell you that the jury was pretty into it and um so I would definitely do that again but that's unusual most judges do not like seeing things on the screen where they don't know exactly what it's going to be beforehand and so I I think that for the most part in our work what we do is this um type of real time um design work real-time visualization it's most useful at the early stages in a case when you can sort of sit with your team and make make sure everyone's on the same page and really you know dial in what the different scenarios are potentially use it with witnesses to get more information and then come up with how you want to present that in court which might be part of a PowerPoint uh show or a you know a poster board that you put up and and have people Point things out what else yes question on this case are you using your own laser scan you so a question is whether we use our own laser scan data or law enforcement and we don't own a laser scanner so it's not it's not our own um when we get laser scan data it's often from law enforcement and um for those of you in here that are involved with law enforcement I would encourage you if possible to package all the actual scans and not just the um the web version the scene to go or the true view version because while you know in theory makes it easier for any party to open them up in practice the vendors don't always um update their you know their web viewer patch sorry the agencies don't always update their software to include the latest sort of web technology and then I go to try to open it and I don't have the correct dlls or the you know it just doesn't work and um and then beyond that it's not the actual 3D data it's sort of a processed version of it so we can't open it and and measure off it from any angle we have to only limited only to those views that are part of that web package I mean if everyone did that I would sing the Hallelujah we something simar you doal smat so yeah the comment is that you know um that uh you know you're able to use Trimble reveal to cre you know to to do some of this work to you know to to show important rooms measurements you know potentially add some people um and then you can also export the data in 357 which is sorry e57 format which is great because it's interoperable among a whole bunch of different platforms you know some agencies uh we've talked to or just didn't say we're not going to do it um but you know in general um we've had good success with if we if we need to coming back and asking for the the e57 format version and then we're able to open that no matter what even if it's in in a proprietary format originally when it was discovered um and then um the other the other thing I will say is that um there's there's there's ways to get information Beyond just scanning like we do have a drone that we go out and fly sometimes there's you know there's there's tools that you can use to to collect you know good measurement data even if you weren't at the scene but of course if on a on a criminal case if law enforcement went to the scene that's going to be the best available data that's the closest to the actual event that we're going to want to use um you mentioned that earlier in your career you were working in construction and not in in this forensics you mentioned now that some you the photographs and reports and on how do you mentally transition from construction yeah how will I me L transition from uh yeah the the the construction sort of Transportation Planning uh real estate work to uh yeah um gruesome horrific crime scenes and I'd say um it's it can be challenging but then I go to a conference like the acsr association for Crime Scene reconstruction and they have an event they called it the last pieace Society where they present CA you know difficult cases they've worked on maybe they've recently solved them maybe they're looking for ideas on a cold case for how could we what else could we do because we haven't been able to to make progress and I went to this you know evening presentation people were you know get up and just show ad hoc show a few a quick slideshow and some of the worst awful crime scenes I've seen and they're doing this right after dinner I'm how do you guys do this it's brutal um but there are some uh things that I am thankful for one is that um we have a level of separation from this um you know it's not they're not people in our family I don't know these people if it was somebody related to me we wouldn't be working on that case um and you know I think that the attorneys that we work with they're much closer to their clients and that can be difficult um but yeah some sometimes we we work on cases you know there's there's cases with child abuse AB sexual abuse and obviously you know terrible gruesome crimes and one of the things that we've had to do as a company is make sure that as we go out to hire we're very very clear um upfront the kinds of things that that we we work on and that we don't apply any kind of political or moral tests when someone comes with us comes to us and ask us to work on a case I mean we won't work on it if we have a conflict but we're not going to come and say well we don't we don't do child abuse cases sorry or or or or this guy's a white supremacist we're not going to work on that that defense we just believe that everyone has a you know a constitutional right to have their side heard in court uh both the Crime Victims for the you know prosecution and also the defendants and we're going to do the best job we can to tell that story and if we do a good job either the resolution will get reached or it goes to trial and there's a judgment and hopefully that TR that judgment sticks because it was a strong case that was put and it wasn't like in adequate representation um and then finally you know we have a larger team now we have nine people so sometimes someone will say hey you know I've worked on six murder cases in the past half a year can I can I take a break from that or you know I I really don't feel comfortable working on this uh sexual abuse case with a teenage girl and and you know that's that's fine like we have multiple people so that we can support each other and and let people opt out of an individual case if they need to yeah back corner men yeah so the question is about this drawing to learn concept and can I give some more examples of how the um the process of creating these 3D models helped us learn more about a case so for sure taking a 3D model of a of a scene and working with a witness every time we learn more sometimes it's because the witness doesn't speak English and so everything that they had told as far as statements had been through an interpreter before and then we're able to show them a 3D model and say well you know were you over here or over here you know how you know what position was your hand in up or down and then we can just do that in front of them and they can just say yes no point this much that way some more and and people sometimes try to give feedback about an event in distances like oh I was about 10t away or this happened for about 5 Seconds you know and then and then this happened people have terrible judgments about distance and time everyone's and everyone's perception of those things is is different as well so I might say to you well you know this this feel this happened for 5 seconds and somebody else might think that was an eternity and someone else might think that was really quick so being able to demonstrate those things visually is always useful and then I'll I'll show you one other um see if I can pull this off of our website here um it's uh we're in Las Vegas right so there's this this Las Vegas bus case that I mentioned we had to do the live modeling for and one of the things that happened in this case and you'll see there's this bus coming across this is the Red Rocks Casino intersection in front and then the bus comes through the intersection and right here is the body of a bicyclist who just got hit but because that darn palm tree is in the way it's hard to tell really what happened what the circumstance of that Collision all we know is the aftermath and you know we had this video from the beginning but it was just a mystery as far as what happened we did a lot of work modeling on the different theories of case visibility what if they would have had you know Advanced Collision detection you know how what if they would have had a safety mechanism in front of that back wheel that ended up being the the uh the the thing that killed that that cyclist um there was talk about like you know air pressure on this bus and what how that might have sucked them into the place where the Collision occurred but then ultimately with the model what we were able to do once we had the work of the experts and or you know sort of looked in and um had an idea for where the Collision on the bus where the initial bus Collision happened and and and and where the person finally ended up then we took a closer look at this camera matched what we knew from the 3D model to the camera and we were able to figure out oh that's where he was that's where the Collision was and we were able to look at the individual frames of that um here they are so we were able to look at these frames really closely and determine that actually you do see this little profile of a bicycle here and all the experts ultimately agreed that's what that was that was that's the bicycle right there but I never would have seen that in fact I didn't see that the first 40 times I watched the video so it sort of knowing what to look for and realizing oh that that that little dark spot it cannot be explained by the bus not getting washed it cannot be explained by the leaves of the tree because they weren't moving in the same way it has to be the bicycle um so that's just you know there's a ton to learn from this process and yeah you just have to see where it takes you so um since we need to get out of here let me finish I got a s concluding thought here and that comes back to what we heard in the keynote at the beginning of the day this idea of be curious not judgmental and the thing is you know the Judgment in a in a court case it should happen at the end if it should happen you know with a judge or a jury but so often what we see in cases is is the Judgment happening with the investigators at the very beginning I have I have an idea what I think happened I'm going to look for evidence that fits that narrative not curious and you know at best it's sort of a missed opportunity to be more prepared for trial what the other side might throw at you and at worst ends up people getting locked up for crimes they didn't commit and so you know what we really say is like you know don't wait until the end and like make all these Graphics at the end to fit your narrative that you've sort of prejudged but bring in someone who's a visual expert who can do the modeling based off of the evidence we've collected and collaborate and hopefully it ends up you're able to reach a settlement without having to go to court so you're going to work with a ton of people in these cases because so you know these days we have lots of people to collaborate with um You probably collaborating with you know other investigators attorneys experts and you know know we all see a different part of the case and it's easy to get bogged down and not see the big picture but the beauty of having a tool like sketch up where you can map out the scenes and understand the big picture is it gets you a lot better prepared to collaborate hopefully get a resolution but if not you just you're you're going to be very well prepared for trial and thanks so much for your time today I'm happy to stick around if people have extra questions and answer those and have a great rest of your conference
