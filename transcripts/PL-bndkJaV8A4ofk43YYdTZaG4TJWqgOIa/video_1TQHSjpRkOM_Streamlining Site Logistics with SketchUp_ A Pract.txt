good afternoon and welcome to base camp 2024 my name is Sarah brocker I will be presenting streamlining construction site Logistics with SketchUp a practical approach starting off with a quick agenda going through the introduction the challenges of site Logistics the power of SketchUp real world applications and integrating SketchUp with other tools starting with our introduction my name is Sarah brocker and I'm a senior virtual construction manager at Messer Construction I've been with Messer for 13 years I lead our VDC efforts in our Cincinnati region and I hold a Bachelor of Science and architectural engineering from the University of Cincinnati I'm an Adjunct professor at Northern Kentucky University and I was I was honored as a woman in stem in 2023 by the Gaskin Foundation who is Messer Messer is an employee-owned general contractor and we work throughout the Midwest over six different states 12 different cities and we build extremely stunning beautiful and complex structures all across these various cities we we live where we work and we will not work outside of our regions uh right now we are estimating a total of 1.54 billion for this year and we are quickly approaching 1,400 employees across the 12 States 12 cities Six States uh we do have a strong commitment to our communities through the commitment of safety quality and Innovation and diversity equity and inclusion our market segments our market segments include Aviation Federal military food and beverage Healthcare higher education manufacturing and Science and Technology we do have our own craft Force so we have self-performance Messer started as a concrete company in 1932 and I'm proud to say we still pour our own concrete today we have over almost 550 uh craft employees in the field from laborers Carpenters seasoned craft workers getting into the challenges of site Logistics construction site Logistics can be complex and challenging due to the various factors that must be managed effectively to ensure smooth operations such as material storage and handling equipment management traffic and site access Labor Management health and safety and waste management just to name a few when you start looking at streamlining your construction site the question always becomes why why is it necessary to streamline well in the the in the event of cost savings when we think of materials and the proper storage and delivery If an item is delivered on site and then has to be moved multiple times not only is it liable to get damaged possible to be stolen there is material theft that does happen uh but storing and moving it takes time and energy right there you'll have a significant cost savings if you have just in time deliveries and you're not moving stored material throughout your project as you're moving from area to area another huge area for streamlining is the time savings again moving those items multiple times is very time consuming and right now one of our biggest Commodities is the workforce uh being able to go through and plan our sites is allowing us to figure out and identify those bottlenecks early and help us figure out how do we plan for the best outcome of the project when do the materials need to be there when does the Manpower need to show up and then lastly why it's necessary to streamline is the safety improvements so not only do you have piles of material but that becomes it could be a potential tripping Hazard falling you know construction sites cannot construction sites can be a little dangerous and anything we can do to make them safer is within our realm and what we need to be looking at so having clear organized Logistics reduces site congestion and helps enforce safety protocols to create create to create predictable workflows now let's jump into the power of SketchUp one of the most crucial parts of SketchUp is the ease of use and the fast learning curve there it's just one of the most in intuitive interfaces I've ever had the pleasure of working with SketchUp is by far probably one of my favorite softwares and the more time you spend in it the more you learn so going through this you're able to very quickly teach others how to use this software and I can get my co-ops up to speed in a record amount of time and be able to quickly become efficient with that software and help us create deliverables SketchUp is also compatible with other Construction softw SES so SketchUp you can actually go in and model some parts pieces and components and you can push it over to Trimble connect techla Navas works and even into Revit and one of the most important parts of SketchUp the extensions I'm going to share with you a few of my favorite extensions so what you see here is when I do these site Logistics I'm usually going to go in identify my site in this case I'm going to use Mir Lake over by the art museum I'm going to pull in the 2D mesh the 3D mesh and I want the site imagery so as you can see I'm just adjusting my map pulling in my map pieces and importing the parts and pieces looking at it here's my 2D over in my tags now I have my 3D terrain as well right now these are all into locked components so I'm going to unlock it and now once I'm inside my first group I'm going to explode explode explode until I'm down to One Singular group what this is going to do is turn all of my tiles into one continuous mesh now when I go to cut a hole in my Surface so a lot of times I'm I got to put the footprint in if I was to cut a hole in the surface right now you'd be able to see that from all sides so the tool I just activated is the enoth volume Terrain I'm sorry enoth terrain volume what this tool allows you to do is I have selected one one mesh and it's going to go in and actually calculate and best fill the background um that way if I do cut a hole in this surface you're not going to see it from the sides um for this operation it does take just a little bit of time so great time to you know take a coffee break you know start this up walk over to the coffee maker get you nice cup of coffee stretch your legs a bit uh I want to say this one took about five minutes I did speed up this this recording um for the purposes of this presentation but given the end results of what we get it is worth the wait if you've not explored Eno's plugins enoth has a lot of various plugins uh I also have used the slicer tool the pipes there we go so as you can see it kind of fills in the background and this will allow me to continue on with my workflow if possible can you edit these class last couple clicks it's not going moving on to my other favorite extensions so I've gone in I've made my terrain now one of my favorite tools you can kind of see it here at the top of my screen this is called 101 tool bits so you've got this whole plethora of various architectural elements out of this entire line of possible tools I can use my favorite tool has has got to be the create vertical walls so I'm going to go ahead and start this recording so go into the extension manager in order to find this you cannot find it 101 you actually have to type in 1001 bit all one word here I'm going to go and give it parameters so I start with 12 in thick and 12 feet high the nice thing about this tool is I can actually click along my terrain and it's going to snap to the surface so that way if I do have my terrain changing I can make my fence follow in suit so here I've got one continuous and it it does put it in a group which is nice uh another one of my favorite tools is the TomTom selection toys that's what you're seeing on the screen here this this plugin this extension will allow you to either Mass select or deselect parts and pieces another great tool for this create vertical wall from the 101 is if I want to create like a path what if I need to make like a gravel road what if I need to add uh a concrete sidewalk to an area that does not show it I'm just going to go ahead and make it like 10 20 feet wide and only make it ever so thin just enough so it protrudes from my Surface and then finally looking at my other favorite my other favorite extensions I've got got my site so I've gone in there's my fencing I like to keep everything nice and organized I love the new folders and the tags you can see all this hidden GE geometry if I was to cut a hole in that surface it would take me forever so what I'm going to go and do is I'm turning off my 3D terrain I've turned on my 2D image I'm going to trace out what I'm calling my footprint or whatever I need to manipulate the surface I'm going to make that into a surface and then I'm going to make into a group before I move forward go ahead and assign it to its tag I'm going to call it two drape and then using the sandbox tool I don't know if anybody's really gone into this this drape feature but as I toggle off the 2D toggle back on my terrain I'm going to go ahead and raise this surface up a little bit so you can get a better representation but it's going to drape that line work onto any surface that is what the drape feature does so I actually select my object go to drape and now it wants me to select the mesh click on the mesh and it'll drop and drop and drape those lines down onto my Surface now the best part is is when I double click into this group you can clearly see that surface is by itself now I can go in and use the Fredo joint Push Pull tool this is from sketch ucation don't forget about Good Old sketch ucation and I'm going to go in and this is going to allow me to multi- push and pull multiple surfaces it doesn't have to be completely flat so this is how I go in and I show my footprints of my buildings so I'm going to go ahead and click done in this case I do like to keep a hide layer because I don't like to hide things they get lost in the sauce so I went ahead and put it on a hide layer that way it's easy to find and I'm just going to go ahead and quickly add some color to represent that I've gone in and dug a hole into this site so using these various extens this is exactly how I have created these next Real World applications starting off with our first case study we have a major Healthcare client here in Cincinnati Ohio not only do we have a congested Urban site there was absolutely no lay down area we had to plan for just in time deliveries to keep the on-site material at the Bare Essentials uh a part of this project was also rerouting a major thoroughfare what you're seeing here I'll kick over to SketchUp in just a second um but we had a highly traveled road that we had to relocate and a part of this footprint was the new tower uh one of the biggest struggles with this main road is we'll get into it is there are this is right where the emergency department that's the existing emergency department and loading dock and then we also were rerouting existing utilities from the existing mechanical room down to the the new Central utility plant so with that I'm going to jump to SketchUp so here we have our first model this is our phase zero went in this is our existing conditions when we went in we actually did have to demo uh quite a few homes uh they were old dilapitated homes that had been run down um and we went in took care of that cleared the site and the first part and piece of this project was this is a major thorough that is going to become a part of our site so we had to go in clear all of this area and start figuring out how are we going to reroute and move this thorough and not cause congestion for the client the community and anyone in the area that's trying to get to the hospital not only that if we keep going a little bit further down this road down here we have ourcal Zoo right down the street that'll come up a little bit later but just to say that there is a lot of traffic on this road is an understatement so one of the struggles on this project as I was talking with the starting slide is this major thare we also had the main emergency department that went up this ramp and their main loading dock which is down here so this is the main loading dock for the entire campus using SketchUp we were able to quickly go through here and figure out you know how how are we going to work the road around how did we need to move the items the parts the pieces how did we need to phase the utilities again this was another big piece of this project is we had a whole lot of utilities that had to come from this building here and come down to the new Central utility plant so looking at this view here we Main maintained at one point in time we did have to maintain the um the loading dock for the dur duration of this project during this phase of this project we actually had to limit the hospitals vendors to 32 foot box trucks um the only people who were allowed to enter this area were the ones going to this adjoining structure the neighboring building and then as well as the emergency crew so ambulance traffic and loading dock traffic we actually if I zoom in here you'll see I mean it almost looks like and it was a very skinny thoroughfare that we had to be able to get the people in and out so again limiting those 32- foot box trucks was a crucial Parton piece of this we never wanted to be the reason an ambulance could never we did not want to be the reason an ambulance could not make it to the emergency department so looking through here using this model we were able to help the design team team figure out and plan where we needed to add aprons where we had to add egress to and from and able to reroute this road entirely around this project not only that another challenge we had on this project was my my project team was interested to see if we could build the site sequentially so as you see as I click through the different models we'll see the actual site progressing with the actual construction schedule so that is exactly why my my building is broken down into so many models it did it did get a little overwhelming at points and times but clicking here you can see we've got both our Tower cranes up and we're starting to pour our slab found or slab on grade at our lowest level and pouring some of our columns at this point our new thoroughfare has been opened and the old thoroughfare has been complet completely closed off at this point in time this allowed us to continue working on our utility work as well as start the mass excavation for the underground for the new tower a part of this we did have to reroute some of our ambulance and emergency traffic at one point in time there was one six-h hour period that we had a flagger standing here and if there was an ambulance coming they would stop all of their traffic to allow the ambulance to come come back here and approach the emergency department to allow us to switch over to the new entrance working through this as I said we just kind of we worked with our design team to figure out did we need any kind of temporary roads to get around as we were again we were taking utilities all the way through under the ground as well as over underneath this roadway so we had to take massive utilities under this road how did we need to phase it did we need a temporary Road um what you're seeing here we actually did not need this condition we were able to plan everything using SketchUp you know we actually went in and showed what it would take to put in a temporary road to allow people to use this as this temporary apron was being built but using our SketchUp models we were able to go in and figure out some of this early phasing and sequencing where we actually just did a quick we did one leg and then we did another without completely blocking the entire loading dock and emergency department so SketchUp on this project was instrumental we used it for all of our in-depth site Logistics and as you can see here we we kept building the structures now the central utility plant I I should have updated a little bit more um that one I do believe at this point in time was probably close to complete uh by the time we topped out with all of our concrete we were almost uh I want to say close to 18 months into the construction of this project another complexity of this was not only were we building a massive tower that was going through an existing thoroughfare and making sure we never interrupted the flow of the emergency department or the loading dock we also ended up with another project right next door at the adjoining property so at one point in time we did have three Tower cranes and almost 15 different Gates spanning an almost two block radius so at times it did get a little challenging not only for the staff you know how are we how are we relaying this to our delivery drivers how are we telling our trade contractors how to get in and out of our structure from here we evolved our site Logistics model to our safety model so here you know I used all those parts and pieces and at this point we took a more close look at the safety aspects of the project not only did we want to identify our Tower cranes our gates uh but other things such as where's our Rally Point for this project if there is adverse weather if you're in the Job trailer complex where do you go to seek shelter if you're out in the middle of this field pouring concrete and winds kick up and a bad storm rolls in where do you go to seek shelf where do you go to seek safety so with this we actually did a safety model and I'll zoom in and show various parts and pieces so here's our broad overview we've got our three different projects we've got our main tower we've got our adjoining property next door and then we've got our Central utility plant let me zoom in down here and take a quicker look at our Rally Point so down here we've got the Rally Point and our trailer complex so we've got a a host of trailers for The General Contractors designers uh there was a large conference room area for safety and owner meetings and then we had an additional trailer in the back with all the trades I actually sat with the trades full-time back in this trailer while we were building this project so in this case if we were in the trailers and we needed to seek shelter there was you know in a case of tornado we would head across the street to the the parking garage and seek seek shelter on the lowest level going through here again just kind of talking about some of those gates at times it got really hard to navigate our folks not only the trade contractors the workers the delivery drivers the the hospital even you know relaying to the owner how are we going to impact their site so we were able to utilize these models to help us go through and actually plan and name all of our gates accordingly we could very quickly show anyone where the gates were now inside our trailers we actually had this image here printed out on a a a piece of paper and down in the lower corner we had a QR code where you could go up and scan it with your phone and at that you had this full safety model on your your phone your iPad any device like that I'm going to take a quicker look at a closer look at the structure itself so from a safety perspective we wanted to go in and identify the different types of railings we would need so we actually have our various kinds of railings around the different floors so up here on the penthouse level we had just it was like a aircraft carrier cable going through stanions down here we had netting so there was a netting that went all the way around each perimeter uh and then depending on where you were at we even identified like where we needed to Corral around this is a shaft that was being built what were the safety precautions we needed to take um and then as you as I move around you can kind of see we even went in and placed all of our fire hydrants fire uh fire extinguishers we were going in and figuring out exactly where did all the fire extinguishers needed to be placed how many did we need per floor and at that you know there's a certain spacing that you need to keep them spaced out we identified our overhead protection for how the workers were to enter and exit the buildings so for those walking in and out of the structure you would actually walk through the conx box into the building to ensure that nothing would fall from overhead these large yellow rectangles that you're seeing these are the temporary stair Towers so it was very quick and easy to identify where was your nearest stair Tower at another piece of our safety model is identifying our buck hoists where do the buck hoists need to go where is the best place for loading and unloading you know you want your your you would like to have a buck hoise close to a dock of sorts for when you're unloading material you could load it right into the Bucko and get your materials up into the build building and for those who are unfamiliar with What a buck hoist is it is essentially an exterior elevator that goes on the outside of a structure so there are safety and we were we even showed our safety railing of where the buck hoist would stop you'd pull the gate back people could and enter and exit the buck hoist so and then even that we had like I said we had three different Tower cranes on this project within like a two block radius so on this project we realized that we do need to identify and we started labeling our tower crane so in this case we actually had I do believe it was crane a crane B and crane C and then that way again it was how do you identify it quickly how do you relay that to your delivery Crews you know where where's your exterior panel contractor to pull up an offload at where do they need to go so using this SketchUp model we were able to host this through a web platform again people were able to use this on their phones we even were able to call out our Corrals so where we needed to load and unload from our Tower cranes we were showing where we were going to drop the load and pull it into safety again this is where we evolved our models we we took it to a safety perspective what are the things we need to look at moving on to case study number two this is another major health care client in Cincinnati Ohio again another very congested Urban site now with this one this project was also adjacent to the emergency department so the emergency room was under this Clover Clover Leaf looking structure um so we needed to maintain access for the ambulance traffic at all times this project required precise demolition uh we'll jump into that a little bit more so there were three existing buildings and that we needed to precisely demolish in this structure and then we also needed to maintain egress from the neighboring buildings in order to keep everyone safe in the event of an emergency let me jump back over to SketchUp so looking at this project here we'll go ahead and start with our starting view on this project as I stated we had three different buildings that were to be demolished so we have this building here that's on the end we have this building down in the inner Courtyard which was definitely a struggle to get to and then we have this building over here that is in between this was probably the hardest to demolish because it was attached to two structures but built right up against this this building to the north was built almost right up against the backside of it so using SketchUp we went in and modeled the entire existing campus this is one of the oldest and most compact and most clustered Urban sites I've worked on each of these buildings was built independently if you're looking at it from a high level this building in particular right here I do believe was one of the oldest buildings on site constructed around 1911 and then this building here was built in 1990 and one of the biggest struggles is this was built as an infill building so as we went in and started demolishing this building on the end this building did not have an exterior facade it was built up against this building so it never required a facade to be installed so that was a challenge we had to figure out how do we do this precise demolition without interrupting this building as well as enclosing it all at the same time another big struggle of this project is you can see here all of these buildings each structure is built independent of the other structure adjoining it and as we went in and looked at this there were also all these tunnels that connected all the various buildings together these tunnel system systems were used heavily by the doctors the nurses the security they'd even wheel the patients down uh to the different areas for different services so a part of this project was we actually had to take over part of this tunnel we had to go in and help them figure out exactly where we needed to stop the tunnel system so here we created a barricade and then we were going to demolish parts of the tunnel to allow us to get some of our heavier equipment back into this inner Courtyard so early on that was our first task was figuring out you know not only how do we tackle it but how do we convey this and relay this to the owner so a part of this we were always in constant constant communication with our owner allowing them to understand the pro progress and the process we were going to take over their their site so the first piece was how do you get to that inner Courtyard and what does it take to get back there so first things first we put that cap down in the tunnel system and then we go in and actually demo parts and pieces of the tunnel this allowed us to start doing some of our Mass excavation and give us some room to get some of our larger equipment back here this is actually it's a radiology an old Radiology structure that we were due to demo so we had really thick concrete walls we needed to get some large equipment back here and order to do this Precision demolition so as we worked through here we figured out the progress the sequencing we closed off the tunnels got back to the inner Courtyard first building we were able to go in and demo was this Radiology building to allow us to get more access back to these structures one of the other big uh problems on this project is there was quite a bit of historical significance on this site to the client and the owner owner um and how do we preserve that how do we not interrupt the historical significance that are adjoining these buildings so we actually went in and were figuring out you know not only did we have to add additional emergency egress from this existing structure we had at one point their emergency egress was through this building in the background and it was grandfathered in while a part of this new building was their emergency exit had to be updated so during live demolition we had this emergency exit installed now this is in worst case scenario if there's a fire if something is is happening to the building this is not your everyday exit this is an emergency exit in the case of an emergency the folks back here would actually come down here through our site and actually egress down these stairs and back up here to seek Refuge so one of the struggles was we actually had to keep an emergency egress path open and uncluttered and there were actually sounds and alarms if there was in the event of an emergency certain construction had to stop immediately in order to keep the client safe we went in and wrecked different parts of our T our tunnels so here we went in there was another segment of tunnels that fed under to this building here we did add in a ramp to allow some of our equipment to get down from this road off to the back so we could actually offload like fourk clifts and smaller equipment and built a ramp form to get access to this inner Courtyard and we went in placed some lagging additional structure to maintain this as we demolished more parts and pieces of that tunnel system so we went in what you can see in this screen here all this magenta this fuchsia looking color we actually work with our uh de I contractor and they helped us model and actually created most of these models uh and allowed me to use them they went in and we're trying to figure out exactly where do we need to protect did we need to protect a different building did we need to protect you know patrons Below in this case we had active construction happening while we needed to start demoing this building floor by floor so we put up the scaffolding system to allow the demolition to keep working in this pit back here while they were able to demolish this building over here off to the side and maintain safety throughout so we're just going to kind of walk through here going to start chunking it off as we walked through and progressed through this this demolition we went in and just floor by floor again this building here did not have an exterior facad we had to figure out how did we waterproof and maintain the the building that was being occupied during the demolition so each floor we would take down floor by floor we maintain the safety the Scaffolding in order to maintain the work back here as well as protect buildings people workers uh again one of the biggest problems that we are always looking out for is how do we keep everyone safe we want people to leave the way they came every single day not a scrap on them and go back home to their fam safe and sound so walking through this we were able to very precisely plan through this demolition phase at this point we've got the inner Courtyard completely cleared out this is all ready we are going to maximize the space I'll show you in a moment um there is a new infill building that pretty much takes up this entire footprint and then a whole another structure will be taking up this area as well now as we keep working through this demolition we still have two more floors to go but one of the challenges we had a Skywalk that was connecting to the adjoining parking garage so we actually had to go in and plan for demolishing this Skywalk system now on this model in particular I was able to utilize scenes and well organized tags to allow me to do this Click by click animation showing parts and pieces either leaving or entering the scenes so here we are one of our biggest challenges was demolishing the three buildings and preparing to actually start the work that we were proposed to do so this was a huge feat in and of itself another big problem we had on this project was where are we going to put the tower crane how's the best place where do we reach it so we did use SketchUp for this as well we pulled in the new structures as well as our tower crane this was built off of our our tower crane submitt so it's the exact height the exact length um but not only that with my structural model in the background you can see all these little squares each one of these represents a column so again Messer is a concrete we started as a concrete company on this project we self-performed almost all the vertical concrete work we could and while we were in the early planning stages you know let's place our tower crane to best fit the The Columns as best we can column forms are heavy they're hard to move uh so if we could utilize our tower crane as much as possible we actually put in our tower crane radius and that way we could see exactly you know on this building back here in the infill structure there were a total of four columns that we could not swing over with the big tower crane that we had to use a lull or some ground piece of equipment to get the the form workk over there to form up these columns before they could be poured so using SketchUp we were able to do additional site planning maintaining our our crane radius um not only that on this project as you can see here off to the left we have their main helipad we had to maintain their helipad throughout this process now if you are familiar with the flight pattern of a helicopter it is a low Rising uh angle that pretty much they will come in and I mean just fly right over top and they will land right here so it's called a cone of influence um and basically it's it's a very low and wide angle that we went through various so many various tower crane options we ended up with a specialty type of tower crane it's called a flathead t a flathead tower crane uh or I believe even a hammerhead tower crane but this one it does not have the real tall jib if I go back to this one here's what our Tower cranes look like on the other project you got this real tall jib off the top of the cab and that is exactly what it looked like on site these we could not have that jib protruding into the airspace for the helipad so using the model we were able to go in take a nice look you know we we maintained our entire crane radius and the height of an influence below their ultimate elevation of the helipad now let's get into integrating SketchUp with some of our other tools we use lumion quite a bit inous lumion is a high-end rendering software that pretty much brings your models to life um as you can see here the image on the right this is just a screenshot from a SketchUp model um I absolutely love SketchUp it is one of my favorite softwares but it does have that that cartoony look to it this software will allow you to give it a rendered look it it's that high polish almost looks like it comes out of a magazine um in this software you're able to create images animations it's got one of the most expansive libraries for vegetation and objects I mean when you when it comes down to these final these these really nice looking images the devil is in the details how can I add you know this this software has probably 80 different types of trees a 100 different kinds of bushes plants Galore has all kinds of various people cars um and all of this you can actually go in and you can actually animate the cars to drive down the street you can animate the people walking you can show birds flying in the sky uh and not only that you have the ability to change the terrain of the model space that is the only thing you can manipulate in the software but other than that you can also manipulate the weather you can move the sun move not only move the Sun but you can add clouds you can make big puffy clouds small clouds You Can Make It Rain you can make it snow um the amount of things and not only that you can have Day scenes and night scenes this software is probably one of our favor favorite rendering tools to use and to use internally tremble connect can't go to tremble Dimensions without mentioning tremble connect this software allows us to connect the right people to the right data at the right time using cloud-based collaboration platform not only does it have an easy 3D viewer you're able to use it online as well as an iPad but you're also able to do real-time collaboration I could go in look at a model mark up put comments and send it back to somebody that's sitting at a desk back at the office from the field and allow them to know the changes that need to be made on the Fly another software we use heavily is Autodesk construction Cloud this is a a construction management software that has built in 3D model viewing capabilities not only does it allow you to natively view any Auto desk product but you are able to natively view any SketchUp model so you just simply drag and drop it to their platform click on your skp file and right there you're viewing your model right through the website so again easy 3D viewer online and iPad viewing capabilities and I saved my my favorite for last uh one of my favorite viewing softwares is called Modello now this is spelled just like the beer Modello in order to get to the website you want to go to mod.io they are based out of China uh they do have servers throughout the the the the globe so we do have all of our projects housed I believe our servers are somewhere in America this online platform will allow you to not only drag and drop SketchUp models Revit models um it's a very easy intuitive 3D viewing application Revit models can be pushed directly from Revit to keep their property data and you can get to that Bim information you know what's what's the the properties that are baked into that object um this website also allows us to model to to host our models directly into a website so I can actually embed my models or host them up with a QR code and that's actually what you're seeing to the right here um as I mentioned earlier on our first case study we had the local zoo that was right down the street well a part of that project we had a big cutout of the image you're seeing on the top you've got Fiona who was born at the Cincinnati Zoo she was six weeks early and she needed a lot of help and this was just a cute little story that they came up with that you know we were going to utilize Fiona's likeness on the project site and we actually had this giant plywood cutout that was about five 5 and 1/2 ft long about 4 feet tall this thing probably weighed close to about 150 lbs and it was due to be moved if not on a daily basis at least a weekly basis all over a concrete structure I don't know about you but it's really hard to see a gray animal on top of a gray structure and as I was watching the three co-ops struggling to load this plywood cutout into the back of the truck to then go move this I was like you know what there's a better way I know how could do this so using my safety model I actually stripped out some of the parts and pieces and then using the 3D uh the 3D Warehouse I found a family of hippos I dressed them up with some hard hats and glasses and safety glasses I did try to put safety vests on them trying to drape material is still one of the hardest things and I've not figured that one out um but again the polygons were already I mean I had so many lines going on I was trying to strip the size of my models um so on a weekly basis we would go into our model and actually move our hippos around and we were sharing this QR code with the local hospitals and allowing them to play a game of hide and seek with Fiona the hippo from the Cincinnati Zoo and if you'd like to join in on the hunt here's the QR code if you're not familiar you can just take your phone point it at the QR code with your camera open and a little yellow box will pop open and then you can just T tap on that item and it'll pull you into the model and at that happy Hunting see if you can find all four hippos hidden throughout the structure thank you for your time and attention [Music]
