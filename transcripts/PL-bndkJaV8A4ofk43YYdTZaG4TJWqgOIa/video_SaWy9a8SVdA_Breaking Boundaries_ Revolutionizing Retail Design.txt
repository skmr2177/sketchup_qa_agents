hi there and welcome to my recording of my session at 3D base camp at Dimensions 2024 this recording is a complete recap of the session that I hosted on the Thursday morning the last morning of the of the base camp sessions um and this is for anyone who was either not able to attend the session um or already had a session booked at that time the session that I hosted was called breaking boundaries um revolutionizing retail design with game development grade boxing and schedule that's a mouthful I'm going to break it down into pieces for you so you understand what this session was about um and why I'm so excited about using game development techniques um in SketchUp for the retail industry all right um as I did at the basic session a little bit about myself I call myself a spatial architect merely for the use of um trying to choose a difficult word that has very little meaning to people um so that you can that you can expand on all the different things that you do um so although was um although I went to college and studied building engineering and architecture I ended up working especially within the events exhibition Booth design um and Retail and sometimes in the architectural sector of residential and Commercial properties uh because so much of my architectural journey is outside of the traditional um architectural Direction um it felt easier at the time to call myself a spatial architect and concern myself for the built environment to its full extent um as you might hear by my accent I was born and raised in the Netherlands and I currently work um and live in South Africa um our studio is three people myself ambulan and Juku and Juku and ambulan are what one would call I suppose apprentices um they're both children from a um from an orphanage or from an orphan environment and um they both finished High School uh but have no tery or college related education um for me why this is important is um the re the way that I came to South Africa was through lutu where I worked for a year as a volunteer in an orphanage um and so I'd like to offer people the opportunity to grow Beyond um the life of being raised in an orphanage it's not always easy for people to transition from that space and it's not always easy to have funds available within those organizations uh for people to go to any higher education so for me me that's you that's important and um the reason why I enjoy what I do so much is I um I can teach them and train them in ways that I was schooled um and hopefully with the specific software that I use in this case um my love for SketchUp I I'm able to teach them things that I have learned um that you wouldn't necessarily learn in college uh so that's how our studio operates um and then I tend to be a very individualistic specific person um and I like the things that I use um so we would always say we're using Google workpace over Microsoft um we don't like working with Adobe products we like working with affinity products um we've got a we've got a real um a real desire to engage with AI um as sort of a backbone or um an administrative heavily um involved tool um we like to have our design process in IM mold skin notebooks using Blackwing 602 pencils um always like to use a Stanley measuring tape if we can um and back it up with digital assets like an iPad Pro U doing a liar scan or scan to design with SketchUp um operate um and engage with our designs in VR um use Advanced um 3D connection um gizmos to to navigate 3D space Etc um and we love drinking coffee over tea so these are some of the the intricacies to to our design studio and um yeah we we like operating the way we operate and being very specific um and the size of about tools we use you know go down a road of um of a few tool sets that you really enjoy using so that's sort of the technicality of using them um gets deferred to the background and you can really focus on your conceptual design process um like all great things in the world um business-wise the only thing you have to do to become a really great entrepreneur um or a really great business is to start in your garage um as this slide proves um so this is our garage this is the way we started um and we've since transformed this space to um to be a little bit more appropriate um and not feel like a garage um we've got some Herman Miller chairs we like the the open desk design solution and that's how we see and secat all our desks um we uh we've got you know all the standard stuff 3D printers uh paper cutting machines um anything to automate some of the workflow um we've got a real love for books um as much as AI helps us to choose a design direction or punch out some AI renders to really be able to um to sort of detox yourself from from the digital experience we like to be creative and um and use resources in book form as a way to um stay inspired um as you can see during this photo shoot my children ended up in the studio and um and they tend to they tend to come visit us during the afternoons most of them are in Primary School um and it's just one of the other facets of the the way that we work um the life that we live where um whereas I enjoy working from home I enjoy the the space that we have I enjoy living a full life um and so having five kids is a is a daytime job in itself and hence they um H they tend to walk in every now and then but it um yeah it keeps keeps the main thing the main thing the the job that we do the work that we do we we um we love doing and we love doing it for our families now back to the actual presentation enough about us and more about retail design so I've broken the session down in five sections I'm going to explain to you a little bit about the origin of gray boxing uh talk through some of the key concepts of how it's used specifically in game development and game design and then I'll show you the adaptation the way that we use it in retail design and and then there was at the base camp session a Hands-On demonstration um where you as a participant could engage with so we created a few scenarios where um a client kept changing their mind on things they were a horrible client in that sense um but it really showed you how the gray boxing technique can be so useful in the beginning and efficient and effective and then uh we ended the session with some Q&A and a conclusion so I will take you through those steps um or through these topics but then I will also take the time to uh relay to you a little bit of what happened in that session all right so on the origins of gray boxing um you might recognize what you see on the on the right hand side of the of the screen of the slide that this is the video game Super Mario right and so Nintendo used this graph paper as a really early on design tool in the 1970 to make up um a video game so before they started coding anything into the final game they did their level design using graph paper and they drew out these blocks so this is a wonderful way of Designing um it's quite effective it's um it's helpful that you can do this over and over again just print yourself out another piece of graph paper and use some coke keys or crayons to to create this design element and so using the simple 2D tile based um square based grids you could create a really easy concept a really easy way to design walls um hanging um and suspended Optical obstacles and so as a prototyping tool um it might be rather primitive but it is a really great way to get a really clear picture of what you're going to achieve in this environment without having to go too deep into the detail of the software so game development as you might imagine or as you might have experienced of course grows beyond that technology um of the early 2D designs and then transitions into 3D game environments um and one of the first techniques that come that we come across is called bsp binary space partitioning um and in the early 90s games like Quake um and um and doom they use this bsp mapping and they create these level designs using very basic geometric shapes to show you what the what the user experience what the level walk through is going to feel like and look like and this is then all done before they started applying textures or detailing out the spaces so this would be considered a very early form of gray boxing you block out the level's basic geometry um so that you understand how to space or function then in the early 2000s we see that software like um well software Studios game studios like epic games and Val they develop their own level editors um and this is where gray boxing then really becomes an accessible tool and so in early versions of half life you can see that all these blocks and shapes all these um components as you would call it in SketchUp well these primitive components they help you to quickly assemble um a level layout and then and test it and later on um we see that with the modern game engin that we have we even heard about it um at some of the keynote uh topics that the integration of Nvidia Omniverse and engine um allows us to to um to create a bridge between SketchUp and these these game development engines and so in that environment we see that in the in the 20110 the tools become far more powerful gray boxing Still Remains as a as a very early way to block out the environment um and then test the game mechanics test the interact ability in 2020 and Beyond we start to see that um people within architecture and interior design also start to use the gray boxing technique and this of course specifically in in a time where um a lot of people will have a YouTube uh Channel with content um created to explain um techniques a lot of all of that what uh what we see there becomes so wildly accessible so wildly perceivable that becomes much easier to understand different ways of Designing um and so gray boxing Finds Its way into other Industries all right so now for the key Concepts that we see within a game Studio on how they how they use this technique they will focus on the layout first and they will use Simple geometric shapes to represent the environment with the right scale the right proportions and give you a sense of the flow of the space they do rapid prototyping drawing only gray boxes is not a very time heavy um exercise and so one level design might guide you through the space in a specific way and one um level design will guide you through a completely different way and so all these different prototypes can stand side by side now this allows for quick feedback and refinement meaning that you might set up that environment and then show to other departments in your in your game development team or game development company um to create a feedback loop so before investing a lot of time and resources inte creating everything very detailed you can use this to to um to go through the concept in in Broad stroks so when you then start to understand the space using um the right skill being able to navigate through the space in real time um to interact with the the interaction points things opening closing turning lights on and off Etc um then the space functions the way you expect it and so then especially in game envir you would then do Collision testing making sure that you can actually walk through the space without walking into things or being blocked from entering and walking through the space and whether that's done in VR or on a screen um that's all accessible so now the adaptation of this in retail and you've heard me use a few words that um might have already made you think about how gray boxing can be used in retail like when we speak about level design we might consider level design um a different word for store design and we see a parallel there uh we might talk about walking through a level and having an objective in the game um consider that the objective of purchasing something in an environment in a store um or navigating your way through the level becomes navigating your way through the different store um locations or maybe there are certain departments in a store and how can you easily navigate from the one to the other so for space planning in retail you can use blocks right you can use gray boxing to produce blocks for fixtures displays uh point of sale counters changing rooms back of house areas Etc and this allows you to experiment with different layouts really quickly as you see on the example on the right hand side and by you know using these Simple Spaces or simple shapes to create these spaces you can iterate really quickly multiple versions of the store now if you in your um design Journey with your client if you very early on Define gray boxing to your client if you help them understand that the first design is not going to be a design that shows you the color of the fixtures and the floor type and and the lighting solution if you rather focus on the flow of the space and how the different departments and different product groups interact in the space um and if you explain to the client that that is the design process that you're going to take them through then also becomes really easy for them to understand what you are focusing on um and as you and I might uh as designers sometimes get distracted by the design process itself like we would like to jump ahead um you know I can't ask you to put your hand up we're not in a in a live session with each other but if you were working on your own design you would also sometimes become distracted and say oh I really want to figure out how this table works instead of drawing a gray box I want to actually find the table that is specifically the table for my client let me go onto the 3D warehouse and download the correct table right you suddenly dive into the detail of this one object but you haven't yet worked out um how that object is going to fit in the space um and how many tables you might head in that space so so these are things to consider up front rather than later on um so instead of getting lost in the detail let's focus on the overall layout first so that testing and feedback with your client helps you then to meet your client's needs and expectations without committing to all the detail within the design um as much as you and I might get distracted by detail by downloading things from the 3D Warehouse your client might also get distracted by a certain texture on the floor when you are trying to discuss with the client in Broad Strokes how the space will operate and function and and what certain pros and cons are your client might get super distracted by the fact that you've modeled something wrong right it's happened to all of us so especially in that early stage of the design process keep everything in in a way as simple or as abstract as possible so that you can take off all the boxes of the layout before committing yourself to the detailed design so this this flexibility just to reiterate it it will save you significant time and cost implications all right so here's some images of a completely different um space than a retail space and this is just for me to show you how this technique can work not just in the retail industry but everywhere so with clear communication for all stakeholders um non-design people you can visualize the space more clearly right this what you see on the right hand side is um is a c manufacturing plant there are multiple production lines side by side and what we were asked to do by a client here was can we investigate if it's possible to integrate multiple production lines so instead of having four production lines can we do five or can we split one of the production lines into two different end products and so after 3D scanning the space and modeling using these basic geometry shapes the um the production lines themselves we could see what were the safe areas in Orange um for fire hazards and Escape Routes we could see in the dark green um where people would navigate um as as the as the staff working on the production floor how they navigated the space and how they walk between the machines uh we can see in the teal blue the spacing required for all the machinery and then we could see in the dark blue the the main main production line that wasn't going to move and then in the opaque yellow above the space we see the um the utilities required to power the Machinery um and this is specifically electricity gas um and pressurized air and now what was going to happen was if the the client had to change some of the Machinery around then they um would also have to um perhaps create create an additional utility line and so they asked us to investigate without creating an additional utility line can we still keep spacing the production lines around at the additional line without the cost of a new utility line overhead um and this was in that sense a really costeffective exercise because this Factory operates um in two shifts um so this Factory almost um um almost doesn't turn off so there's very little time to make these sort of alterations to the space um and it can be very cost heavy to stop the whole production plant to start experimenting in real time with the existing manufacturing um yeah with the existing production lines so instead of physically moving all of this around let's move it around digitally first um and gray boxing um very simple primitive models um are sufficient in showing all these variations so again um a wonderful way to tackle some of these these issues all right so that's enough about um the history of great boxing in the game development industry um the key concepts of what you can what you can use out of this specifically for retail so in the Hands-On demonstration that we did at the base camp event I asked everyone to participate by downloading a model um a test model from the 3D Warehouse so what I will do is I will introduce you to a case study in existing space here in South Africa I will then demonstrate to you how uh we used a basic model to set up the the layout of this store and then I will introduce you to the exercise file that um I have created that you can download and then I will give you the time um to play around with this uh yeah then I will give you the time to play around with this concept story yourself all right so the space that we're going to look at is called laler perie it's a fine watch in jewelry store in manga ocean small on the east coast of South Africa um it embodies uh the style of a parition apartment evoking this 1920s uh French art deiv the love of life um and it's meticulously designed to give you this unique shopping experience where as much as you are there to purchase physical peace um you are um buying into the experience of um of this life um and so the adventure of life and celebrating life's achievements is as much part of the experience as it is to Pur the physical watch or jewelry um Jean phelip and his team head upier um and so you can see here a photo of them standing in front of the store and and what their website would look like so in this case study um what I want to demonstrate to you is how um you can potentially look at designing the space um and then at the end of the presentation I will showcase I will demonstrate you the the actual final design so you also have an idea of what this turned out to be all right so while I'm showing the the demonstration to you um I will ask you to download the exercise file U from the the 3D warehouse and then once I'm done demonstrating the exercise itself I'll give you the time to walk through three iterations of the design process um and you can choose um a hypothetical client um instruction a hypothetical client brief and then we will walk um through these designs together so before I show you this slide let me also open up uh SketchUp on my side and demonstrate it okay so here's SketchUp um I'll go to the 3D warehouse and I'll type in the session name um the letter s for snake Dash 1744 and then you'll see you'll get as the result this exercise file so it's session 1744 Base Cam 2024 um and then you can download that directly into the model and um let just place this in the center and make the default trade a little bit smaller all right um so this is the this is the environment and let me give you a little bit more contrast by changing the Style real quick and let's do a speedy style shade it with textures there we go and then I'll show you in the text how we set up this environment and make that a little bit bigger okay um I can't see scenes have I turn my scenes off or my scenes not saved no my scenes were not saved in this file that's all right um at the moment what we can see is uh the gray boxing elements are these columns and these uh cylinders let's explode this for a moment and what you can do is we can turn the guides off and we can turn the grid off if you want to use the grid the grid is set up to a meter by meter so roughly 3x 3 foot um and hopefully that will um help you to navigate the space quickly without having to measure things out U the mall environment the steel that we see uh the walls again the the grid lines the gray boxing elements the floor um the environment and the columns all of these live on their own layers um so that can be quite helpful for now I'm going to turn the guides and the grit uh off no I will keep the grit on and then our dear um figure we will just space him outside the store and I get the feeling that when I inserted this um I didn't go directly down to the bottom to the base Point um so I'm just going to snap to the grid here and snap to the the zero point of my SketchUp model and so if we had to select um any of these colors and any of these shapes for any particular areas in the store um I would say for example this this dark gray is black um Can represent a store room or a staff room and we're just going to use the scale tool to scale this uh following the grid line as um as a way to space this um and I might as will make it the full height of the store so you get an idea of what the store room and staff room could look like um and maybe what I should do is I should make the store room um sort of half the depth and then using the white um I can make a copy of this object and I can actually just sample this white so that we're using the same colors excuse me um Can sample this white to get that different color going okay and then this this would be the star room and the gray box would be the store room then for one of the displays let's say we're doing a makeup display or a fine jewelry display we're going to use this this pink one and um I'll make a copy of it so I don't lose the Box which I didn't do for the gray so let me copy that over and then I'm going to make this display 4 M across and one M deep um and I'll place two side by side and maybe I should just make a a copy by rotating one and place that sort of Center along the back wall just follow the grid lines as a guide and then that I'll place there uh maybe there should actually also be a round table in the center which won't be that high but actually will be a slightly bigger table and that will sit there okay so now I can walk in through the store through this door and that door and then um my second product range might be the teal and instead of creating new boxes and W displays I'm just going to make a copy here um wrote it maybe at 45° position that against the wall I'm not going to be too precise I know that the wall is slanted a lot more but this is the the early on impression and now I feel like that this front space is is a bit too empty so I'm going to start with yellow um and not create something very big but maybe something 2 m the same height as the table at present and then these will be the display boxes I suppose in front of the in front of the store so we'll do one there oh it started floating a bit do one there and we'll do one here there okay um so these are alongside the glass as I'm walking past the store these will hopefully attract my attention and now I get the feeling that this is still too empty and that's still too empty so I'll copy one over and position one here and I'll copy this one as well sort of sits under the same angle and then I will color them in the other two colors so that they direct your eye towards those displays they all feel like part of the experience don't know exactly what happen here with the teal in the background but they're not touching the floor um so let me scale that back so that everything still sits flat in that space yes um and then it'll probably be wise to also have a checkout counter so let me use this this red color here and make that maybe 3 m across and then also not so high or tall and then this this um would be a very very quick um 3D model of a store environment um and you can see how you can navigate a space how you sort of end up in these called the SE these um these circular end sections of the store that you can just keep walking around and navigating yourself through the space without ending in a in a sort of dead Corner um and this could be a very early version of three modeling a store with certain requirements now let's go back to the presentation and what you can see here is we're going to work work through three iterations um in the session um in Vegas I gave every participant about 15 minutes to walk through one of the iterations um and then we kept changing it so what I want to ask you to do is maximize the the space for retail display by client one um add a small storage space and create multiple exclusive product zones so if you choose to work for client one uh what I ask you to do is then from now on follow the instructions for client one as we go through the different iterations if you would prefer to want work for client to then balance your retail space with with a store room so equals space for retail equal space for store room minimalism here is key so don't display too many products client three wants to focus on wall displays with seating in the center minimize the angles make everything straight okay once you've started working through this and you can pause the video at any time of course um work through this for about 10 to 15 minutes maximum like really really try not to overthink it really try to use as many of the geometric shapes um as possible to create the right layout that you so desire to create and then after 10 minutes just stop in your tracks um and then go to the next slide so you can again you can pause the video work on this and then go to the next slide but the reason I'm asking you to pause this is not to look ahead um and basically cheat your way into iteration two and three um because I'm trying to help you design I'm trying to help you iterate really quickly um and each time make a very significant transitions between each iteration um really change the case study dramatically some of the participants um said to me when I showed them iteration three are these real clients and so hopefully these are not real clients because the changes are a bit too dramatic um but it it can help you navigate some um maybe some difficult client conversations all right so um iteration two create an additional room for client one in the same size to the store room but for a staff restroom so whatever size store room you created create an equally sized staff room and this might cause some conflict with your product displays so perhaps you have to remove some for client number two you can reduce the store room so reduce it by whatever size or percentage you envision um and and then utilize that space for more product display for client number three please create an exclusive product Zone um which can include angled walls so that's the deviation there all right if you've given yourself 10 to 15 minutes on this iteration then you can move to iteration number three and for iteration number three I'll show you two slides first slide here are the changes for client one client two and client three and then what I've done just to edify this if this sounds a little bit too confusing I've shown you these small diagrams as well so I'll just go back and forth between the slide that comes next so here you can see the changes client one two and three okay um so client one you reduce the retail space to the left hand side only storage and back of house remains on the right hand side okay so in red is storage um and back of house and on the left is retail space in green so client number two does something similar but you're only allowed to use storage and back of house in the top right section of the store and then the left hand side of the store um is still fully for retail and then in iteration number three you see we're not using the door on the left side R using the door at the bottom right and then you need to mirror the whole store so whatever was on the left has to be on the right and whatever is on the right is now on the left um and that's just so that you can play around a bit with the angles of the wall um and see how you can Revitalize the space now that it is swapped okay I hope you I hope you've had fun I hope you've been stretched a little bit I hope you didn't go um beyond your Breaking Point with these mad clients that wanted everything changed every single iteration um and I hope you've learned some things um if if the technique seems useful to you um I don't know if within the within the base camp uh review you can leave comments on each session but um feel feel free to um to connect with me on LinkedIn or Instagram whatever you prefer and then um and then that way we we can connect around this topic um as I want to develop this content uh further so the key takeaways for today is um focus on your layout do not get distracted by the details use Simple geometric shape so it's easy to create quick iterations um and do early feedback session so you don't have any wasted resources between yourself the client and any other stakeholders test as many ideas as you can um and then that way you'll create the best solution for your client the attendees shared their experiences and I will share them with you um as the video comes to an end but um if you if you want to do a survey of what I showed you digitally today please scan this QR code um if this is no longer live again um feedback can provide perhaps in the comments or it can be provided uh to me personally on LinkedIn Etc um if you want to connect with me you can scan the the LinkedIn code or the Instagram code and if you want to learn a little bit more about these uh design techniques or where I drew my inspiration from and where I came across this technique then you can use one of these three links below uh to learn more about level design spatial communication um and introdu ction to level design itself here are all the three codes together so that's it um I hope you really enjoyed this session I recorded a second session um that was unfortunately not available at base camp uh which is a bit longer and it focuses on digital twins for um for retail and we're looking at a multitude of stores and see how we can use components Dynamic components to really quickly set up a space um and then go through the process of not just modeling stores and creating digital twins but actively engaging with different campaigns uh for clients and their um changes between summer and winter and then um working all the way from the early concept to production files um and artwork files for print so that all of this can be created so that is um that's this for this session um if you want to find the other session I'm sure you can um you can look for my uh speaker handle on the on the 3D base camp uh resources page um if you find this content interesting please reach out to me on LinkedIn to create any other more educational material for retail I know it's sometimes hard to come by in either the SketchUp Community or online in general and I'd be happy to create more content if you um have any ideas or want to connect with me for any projects again connect with me on link in um and with that thank you for watching this session and I hope to see you at basam 2026 [Music]
