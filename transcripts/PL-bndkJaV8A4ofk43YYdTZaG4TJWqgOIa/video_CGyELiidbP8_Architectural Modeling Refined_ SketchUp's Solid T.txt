hello everyone and welcome to 3D base camp at Dimensions with Trimble uh I'm excited today to talk about uh architectural modeling refined how I use sketchup's solid tools for efficient design uh I think it's one of the core things that everyone should know to properly model and not just model but to efficiently uh change their models and how to really create cool geometry so I'm Matt wheeler I'm a senior partner at Affinity Architects I've been working for over 20 years uh and using SketchUp since about 2004 uh it's been a game changer for how I've uh used my career and how I've used the program in my career uh so I'm really excited to show you what I do uh I lead a team of about 16 modelers within my firms so we uh use SketchUp every day uh and this is how we present our projects and this is uh the workflow in which we're going to talk about just to show you some of the projects uh that we work on everything you see here was all modeled in SketchUp designed in SketchUp uh this is just the how we work how we present things uh so everything you see here was done in SketchUp so again just some of our work uh so what do we going to talk about um why solid modeling is important uh the tools you'll need to properly solid model uh and then we'll get into some demos uh understanding what the solid tools actually are and then we'll use um solid tools practically to show you how we use those in our daily workflow we'll do some quick little examples as well as uh start building a house so why is solid modeling important uh so for many reasons uh it'll force you to have clean geometry it'll force you to reduce file sizes because you're keeping that really clean geometry and really tight in how you are approaching modeling uh most importantly for me it allows me to quickly edit my models uh and we'll kind of get into that into the demo uh as well as in making changes I don't know about you and how your workflow goes but I have yet to have a client that we design something and it never changes there's always changes there's always things that need to happen and we need to be able to do that um uh both quickly and efficiently so we need to be able to have consistency in how we model amongst our team so that if someone else is working on a project we can easily jump in and know what to expect and how that model was built so that we can quickly and easily edit it uh again changes are inevitable so we got to be able to make those changes um and as we talked about a little bit already uh it improves improves collaboration uh because if there's consistency in how things are done then we can easily jump in and make changes because we know what to expect some of the tools you'll need for success in this uh well are solid tools right this is a uh uh uh Native in-house uh extension that uh comes pre-installed with SketchUp uh I'll show you how to activate it if it's not already activated on yours a couple plugins uh I use one from TomTom uh solid inspector 2 uh absolutely invaluable for this process same thing with cleanup 3 another one by TomTom an absolutely invaluable uh plugin that makes life much easier and even Beyond just solid tool modeling it's just a fantastic one that helps you keep clean geometry throughout the process uh some other little functions uh like hidden geometry again that's a native command within SketchUp so we'll talk about that uh as well as another fantastic plug-in by Chris Fulmer uh called loose to groups uh I use this one all the time uh as well as then just a general understanding of groups themselves uh which again we'll talk about in just a second so uh let's get into why we're here let's dive into some demonstrations so let's start looking at um creating uh groups that everything has to be a group so everything starts from being a group so what does that mean um so if we look here this is just a square uh I'm going to type R for rectangle draw rectangle Push Pull and I pull it up and I just built a cube right but this is uh what I call loose geometry so it's just faces you see I can click a face I can click a line I can't do anything with this uh at its core in SketchUp groups are one of the most critical items so the first thing we need to do is uh turn anything loose into a group so you can do that by selecting everything right-clicking and going make group uh I have control if I select everything I have control G uh as a keyboard shortcut to make a group uh I think using keyboard shortcuts is invaluable from a speed perspective and I highly suggest everybody uh understand keyboard shortcuts create your own keyboard shortcuts uh it is uh invaluable in my opinion so we just made this group um I'm going to right click and explode and just kind of talk through this one more time if you didn't know there's actually multiple ways of making selections so here's a fun little just tip to share with you so a single click on the face obviously selects the face a single click on the line selects the line now if I doubleclick the face you'll see it selects the line as well as all of the bounding edges for that face if I doubleclick the line it selects the line and then any face associated with that line and then lastly if I triple click anywhere it selects everything that's attached to that face or that line so it's a quick way you can either go left to right and Encompass the whole thing or right to left and then whatever you cross is what it selects uh but it's always tricky because you could be missing some information or uh I generally go to a triple click and that quickly allows me to select the whole thing and then contrl G to turn that into a group all right so now that we have a group let's talk about uh groups versus components um it's not components themselves are not critical in solid tool modeling but they're critical to understand what and uh might happen by interacting with components and how you might break the components so I just wanted everybody to be aware so we'll talk through that as well so here if I right click this first one you can see edit group this is a group if I rightclick this one this one says edit component so this one's a component uh and just to make sure everybody is on the same page if I make copies of these and I edit my group by double clicking I can go inside the container and I can start editing this if I draw something and pull it up you'll see nothing happened because this was the copy of this now my component if I jump in edit this push pull this you see my um component will also update that's the nature of components it's it's like if you ever use AutoCAD it's like a block if you edit one it edits all so it just needed to be aware as to uh the difference between groups components uh so we're going to come back to this in just a second once we start interacting with solid tools to show you what will happen uh by using each of these in solid tools so to talk about some of the plugins we mentioned previously solid inspector so it is imperative that your material is a solid and there's a very specific definition to that it essentially is a container that must be able to hold water without extreme um extra information in it and so we'll go through some examples as to what that means so uh we're before we even jump into solid tools themselves I am going to use the solid tool icons to uh show you uh which ones are considered solids and which ones are not it's a quick easy way to see it if you don't see uh solid tools which is this bar right here if you rightclick anywhere up here you can come down and see uh look for solid tools and just make sure it's checked and active and on so uh I'm I'm going to click on um this first one here which is the uh uh shell doesn't matter but all I'm getting at is now if I hover over this guy you'll see my arrow uh right now has the uh red circle saying that it's not touching anything that's solid if I hover over the Box you see that turns to a number one and you'll see it pops up and says this is a solid group so that's good that one works if I hover over the next one even though all four of these look identical this one is telling me not a solid uh not a solid and not a solid well we can go through and start inspecting these on our own uh I can go around and look and say okay well this looks like a solid I don't see why it's not a solid uh and I can spend time and figure it out but the great thing with solid inspection now is uh we have the ability to go to uh believe it's under extensions or uh here it is uh solid inspector now again we talked about shortcuts I use F3 as my uh shortcut for solid inspector or you can come to tools and click on solid inspector with this highlighted so we'll do that and you'll see that this pops up and instantly highlights hey there was a stray Edge inside of here uh and we need to get rid of that so we talked about there can't be extra information so this finds the extra information as to why this is not a solid and allows me to fix it now the great thing about this plugin I can click fix and it'll actually fix it for me and we'll do that in a second but before uh we do that what I want to do is uh jump into one other command so again we don't see that there uh what we could do is go to view and then hidden geometry and again you'll see I have W as my shortcut that allows me to turn uh hidden geometry on and off so if I hit W you'll see there's now this dotted line showing me there's a hidden line within this block so uh I could find that pretty easily uh but it's not always that easy this is obviously pretty clear uh but and I can go in and simply erase it and then be done but we'll go back to our solid inspector I'm going to tap F3 because that's my shortcut command uh and by the way another quick little tip if you need to um if you want to change your preferences uh and your shortcuts if you go to window uh preferences and then come down to shortcuts you can type in any command you want so for example we were uh just talking about um solid inspector so under filter I just started typing solid and then clicking on tool solid inspector and here you can add a shortcut so I'm going to tap the F3 and hit the plus sign and because F3 is already assigned you'll see It'll tell me that gives me the warning F3 is currently used by tools solid inspector 2 would do you want to reassign it in this CL case I can click yes because it's simply reassigning it to itself uh or you can click no and then find one that's not assigned or yes and overwrite it totally up to you but this is how you can set whatever preferences you want um so uh again I'm going to click on my box I'm going hit F3 and then I'm going to click fix and get rid of the straight edge and you'll see that goes away and now when I click on my solid tools and hover over it's telling me hey this is now a solid so let's go on to one more quick example uh don't know why this one hit F3 uh straight edge huh I'm not quite sure where it is it's not highlighting it so I'm going to hit Tab and tab will actually zoom in on where an issue is okay uh so I can quickly see uh I have this micro line right here uh and that little line which is again why this tool of solid inspector is so great because trying to find that little thing could be so tedious and near impossible uh but now quickly uh typing F3 fix straight edge uh and then now hovering over this is now a solid great so let's try one more hit F3 oh hey this is telling me a surface border is missing I'm going hit tab and you can see it's doing this giant Circle so I'm going to move around oh okay it's missing a whole face here so remember we said it had to be watertight this is missing a a face so it wouldn't be able to hold water now on this one it's telling me hey there's a surface border issue uh but instead of fix all it's telling or fix it's telling me info uh it cannot fix this one on its own but it'll give you info and tell you kind of how to fix it so in here I'll just have to go in and draw a line and connect the dots and reapply that face come back out and now if I hit F3 it's saying everything's good to go so that's solid inspector such a great one uh we will come here to go to cleanup so this is going to be in the same vein as solid inspector but this is just such a great tool that it'll do things like solid inspector as well as I'll use this later on uh just for easa modeling and you'll see that as well so we're going to dive into this one a little bit deeper as well later but the way this one works is um so again if I check this one here is a solid group so I'm good here I don't need to do anything but if I check this one and I'm only seeing this line because I have hidden geometry on I'm going to turn hidden geometry off come here and say hey this is not a solid anymore I could hit F3 and it's finding that same straight edge but instead of fixing it this time I'm going to come in here I'm going to hit W uh because I want to find all straight edges I'm going to do control a to select everything um and then we can run our clean command which I have the Tilla key which is that little squiggly line to the left of the number one uh I guess technically it's the accent cuz I'm not hitting shift but either way it's the key to the left of number one that's my shortcut key uh just where I put it uh you can make it whatever one you want uh either way when I tap it or if I do go to tools um I believe it's under Tools I hardly ever go up here to look for these things uh because I use all my shortcut keys so under extensions clean up three you can go to clean clean with last settings all those things all I really care about is just cleaning it so I'm going to select everything tap my clean command and you see as soon as I tapped it that hidden line went away because what it's going to do the way this works is it searches for anything that doesn't belong to make this as simple as possible so that worked out great um I'll jump into this one let's just double check is this one a solid uh it is so I think we're good to go uh so that's cleanup C command and again we'll jump more into that one later uh and show you a little bit more about that um I believe this file we're using right now is provided to you in the folder so you can follow along download it test all this out and you'll see these little screen grabs as to where you can download and find these from the extension Warehouse uh lastly uh loose to groups from Chris Fulmer is an absolutely fantastic uh plugin I use this all the time in my day-to-day workflow flow uh we'll show you some of those features right now so here we have the same uh cubes that we were talking about uh everything here is loose geometry except for this one you know you can see this one is um here and it is a solid group great but this one is not and this one is not so I can go through here you know triple click contrl G come here triple click Control G and turn all these into groups and I'm done but if we have a ton of these things uh you know it's not always efficient and I'm always looking for how can I do the least amount of work to do the most things uh so that's where this guy comes in so I'm going to grab all of these shift X to explode everything so everything is now back into loose geometry uh so to use this plugin I'm going to select everything uh and uh I believe it'll be again under extensions uh Chris Fulmer tools and then loose to groups uh and again you can see I have shift G here as my uh shortcut command so I'm going to do that I'm going to select everything and I'm going to hit shift G on my keyboard and now instantly this is now a group this is now a group and this is a group so just like the title says it turns loose geometry into groups it doesn't necessarily make them solids meaning if I explode all these again and I delete this face uh and then select everything and then go shift G it still turns this into a group group group even though this one is not a solid it's just grouping everything together uh so just to be clear on that all right so let's get into some actual examples we've gone through the tools we need and we have a overall understanding of the very Basics to get us into solid modeling so let's now start talking about how solid modeling actually works so again as we mentioned you have to have uh solid items grouped solid items to be able to interact with each other so this one here is a grouped item this one here you can see is loose geometry so that's not going to do anything for us so we would need a triple click Control G turn that into a group now we have two groups in which we can interact so let's start interacting with things the first one up is the subtract Tool uh this subtract tool essentially removes one solid from another solid so there uh the order of operation is important you want to start with the item that will remove the Chunk from the item you want to keep meaning uh that so let's just show you by example so if I come over uh and go to uh my subtraction Tool uh which will be this third one right here so if you hover over it and let the mouse sit it'll highlight which one is which so I'm going to go to my subtract tool and I'm going to select the first one and then click subtract and uh or if you don't have anything selected and go to subtract you'll see down here on the bottom it actually gives you directions it's saying select first solid so I'll select the first solid and then now it says select second solid and we click the second one and so now you can see it subtracted the first solid from the second solid so uh I call them cutting boxes so we're going to use a cutting box to subtract from what we want to keep now if we do the order of operations in Reverse so we'll go to subtract select the bottom one first and then the top one you see it creates the opposite effect uh so that's subtract tool now we'll go with the intersect Tool uh which is this uh this second one now uh I forgot to mention this earlier uh solid tools is only part of pro I believe there's minimal solid tools in the free online version uh but you do need to have the pro version for the full solid tool package um so if we go to intersect uh and again the same thing this one's going to be a little bit less important from order of operation um and you'll see why in a second so if I select uh the first one oops I had something else selected so if I go to uh intersect select the first one and then the second one this is now creating geometry where these two items come together so just as it says it's the intersect tool so you can uh if I hit X to go into x-ray mode you'll kind of see how these two are overlapping each other that's where they're intersecting and that's the geometry we're going to create I can also select both and then hit intersect and it'll do the same thing so now we're going to do the trim tool which uh this the trim tool works a lot like the subtract command uh except there's one slight difference and I'm going to show you here uh what that difference is so the first one I'm going to do the subtract tool the second one I'll do the uh trim tool and you'll see the difference so if I go to subtract um and I click one and then two you'll see just like before it subtracted this one from this one now if I do the trim tool we're going to end up with the same result uh but it'll happen in a different way and there's one important reason uh why this one would be valuable so this second from the right is the trim tool so I'll do trim and I'll again I'll do number one and then number two now it may not look like something happened but if I move this geometry out of the way you'll see I ended up with the same result but the big difference is that the trim tool does not delete the first set of Geometry The Cutting box as I call it so the if you have to do multiple Cuts uh this is a good way of essentially subtracting things while keeping the geometry there so what does that mean let's come down here and say we want to build a uh cool design in a fence uh I'm going to hide this real quick and you see we have all of our pickets here and we want to create this uh elliptical kind of cut within our fence I could select this and go to uh subtract and subtract from the first one and you see we made that cut great that's the start of it but I now lost my cutting box it's gone because we use subtract I'm going to undo so one thing you could do is I'm going to hit contrl C to copy this and then we will subtract this first one from the second one even though the box is now gone if I hit controll shift V for paste in place that comes back and I can now subtract again and I can keep doing that over and over uh and just to also add it out there I use Alt v as inv Victor as my subtract because I use subtract quite a bit so if I select the first one alt V second one control shift V select the first one alt V subtract so you can see I can continue to do this but we're also always looking for efficiency how can we be super efficient so let me undo and come all the way back so this is where the trim command would be much more helpful I can uh open up my trim command select the first one and then click uh the second one and if I hide this you see it made the cut great and it left the Box behind so I can use it again so trim trim uh and then trim uh trim and it'll just keep doing trim and you can make a shortcut which I don't use trim a ton but you can make a shortcut and just keep uh doing this over and over so you can see if I hide this we're now moving much faster than we were before a lot less commands a lot less interaction while getting the same kind of result so that is the trim command I am going to uh undo this because I'm going to come back and we're going to combine a bunch of these other commands and attack this problem in a different way in just a moment so we are going to put a pin in this one and come right back so now let's get into split and we'll see what happens here uh I'm going to have nothing selected I will uh grab split and I'm going to do uh item one with item two okay we completed it doesn't really look like anything happened though you can see lines are now existing versus back here there aren't so what does split do split works a lot like subtract as well as intersect uh as well as trim meaning you're creating geometry uh but uh split will actually kind of do all the above so you see it subtracted out of this one subtracted out of this one and created this geometry where they intersected so split kind of is a combination of all those things uh so you um can create a very uh complex geometry and multiples of those geometries pretty quickly uh outer shell and Union so both of these uh all of the ones we've been talking about are subtractive uh these two are our additive uh meaning they combine things uh so outer shell and Union generically do the same thing but they're again is going to be one slight difference uh and we're going to talk about the difference uh in just a second we're going to start with outer shell this is honestly the one I use the most outer shell and subtract are the ones that I use probably 95% of the time and what outer shell does is think about it like an egg shell you're essentially creating what is the outer shell of the combined geometry that you're looking at so using our same two cubes if I use outer shell which is going to be this first one here I can combine first one with second one and you see this is now one set of geometry if I come to the group and I hit x-ray uh you can see this is clean uh combined geometry as one group uh versus uh you know here this is uh uninter acted IM uh geometry so uh you can see the difference now if I select both uh and then do outer shell it does the same thing so again this is one where you can go click click or just select everything that you want to join together so now let's get into Union which is going to be um this third icon here the real difference is and I honestly hardly ever use this one in reality it is tries to keep the information that's on the inside as well as the outside versus outer shell is very clean and simple so what does all that mean uh I'm going to hide uh this lid right here on these boxes so you'll see I have um you know a rough floor plan where I have Wall outer walls inner walls Etc as well as uh this roof right so I am going to uh again I'm going to hide these and I'm going to use my outer shell real quick and I'm going to uh just to show you this is a wall this is a wall this is a wall and these are my exterior walls so I'm going to use my outer shell uh and I could use uh Union would do the exact same thing in fact I'll do this one here as outer shell and I clicked all these objects and now what's happened you can see those lines have gone away uh you can see the lines exist here these lines have gone away because now this is one complete set of geometry because we brought everything together so that was eggshell and on this one if I use Union it'll do the exact same thing because the difference between eggshell uh excuse me outer shell and Union has not occurred yet and we're going to get to that in just a second uh but you can see this is the same geometry so now if I unhide things I now have a lid so I'm going to use outer shell on this first one and click and click and then I'm going to use Union on this one click and click okay so these two look identical right now right but if I go to x-ray mode you'll see that this is simply just as we previously described the outer shell of the whole thing so all of the interor ior spaces are completely gone because this command was only worried about having what is the outermost piece that still creates a solid versus Union uh is essentially creating uh uh if I come into this group and select this it essentially created this group uh this group this group and this group so it's looking how it can create all the group groups that it needs to to keep the same voids uh that previously existed um again I really don't get into that one much uh I find just using outer shell works most of the time because I don't group things together this way so uh let's get back to this one over here this trim let's kind of apply uh attacking how we might even be able to create this fence outline even more efficiently using all of our solid tools uh combined so each one of these pickets are an individual group that means I I interact this with this uh at one time and that's pretty inefficient so I'm going to I'm just going to grab this solid and I'm going to move this down just because and I'm going put it here at the very bottom and I'm going to make another copy and I'm just copy at 10 ft over and what I'm going to do is uh this might seem weird and convoluted at first but hopefully you'll see where I'm going with this in just a second I'm going to select all my pickets and this bottom piece and I'm going to click outer shell and now if I jump into this this is all one giant uh group that uh has this unifying piece on the bottom now if I use my uh subtract command so I'm going to select this top one alt V for subtract and now I select this in one shot I just got rid of this whole thing and perfect it looks great but I now have this weird uh geometry on the bottom that was kind of combining everything and I don't want that anymore so I'm going to move this piece over uh back right on top of where it was and I'm going to use alt V once again and I'm going to subtract that out from this and there we go that's all now gone perfect that was essentially two interactions and I was able to accomplish everything we talked about before uh in creating this but as you might be aware if I come back inside of here these now are all individual loose groups uh and uh you know I that's not necessarily what I want I I want to get these back to being their own individual groups okay well what did we talk about previously we have this over here this loose to groups so uh when I come into my fence I'm just going to double click to get inside of here select everything and then um shift G now each one one of these is back to an individual group that quickly so that is kind of how I want you to start thinking about how solid tools really works into day-to-day workflows to create geometry quickly and efficiently uh and it just becomes ingrained into everything you do and how you model everything uh and we're going to get into a house example in just a minute uh to really talk through that uh before we get into the house example let's look at just a couple of quick little examples that might be of interest so uh I created this uh kind of spiral pick it if you will and just wanted to show you how I did it uh using solid tools I'm sure there's many ways of building this but this was just a fun quick way so I have this little square right here or cube I should call it um I'm going to jump into here so I'm dealing with the loose geometry I'm going to select the top face of this uh I'm going hit t for rotate uh I don't think that's a preset rotate uh I changed it um because I used I think R was rotate or some whatever the original one was I just ended up changing t for rotate just to be clear uh but you can go to tools and uh rotate is all we're doing and I'm going to come to this Center Point uh uh I'm going to click once drag out click again and now I'm going to rotate this uh and I'm going to rotate it uh 45° uh I'm now going to erase this line I just needed it for the midpoint intersection and now I have uh this guy um and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy this over just so you can see what's happening I'm going to then copy this up and we will rotate this 45° and then we'll copy this one up and actually I can grab both of these and we can copy this up and we can uh now copy it up and maybe type 10x to array and copy uh make many copies so from here we can select everything and I'm going to hit alt C which is my shortcut for my outer shell so I have everything selected alt C now everything is joined together as one solid um then I'm going to jump inside of here I'm going to hit alt a to select excuse me control a to select everything and then to get rid of all these lines I'm going to run my clean command and then uh so you can see that got rid of uh some of these lines and off screen I'm going to pull this over we are going to um pull up uh soften edges and we can just slide this over until we soften everything to make it look good and done so that is how I use solid tools to create um this uh you know this kind of spiral design so so you can play around with it you can change instead of uh you know 45 you can do me know even like 30° you can play around with however you want to do it you can change the size of it uh to get all different kinds of effects so again if you copied it down you know squatted it 45 and then let's just copy a just another one up and we're going to run through that same process doing all the same things again and we will uh there so you can see I can make a tighter spiral so you can play with it however you want to play with just kind of want to get the idea across uh just a quick thing just to kind of show how uh we can make this generic flower it's not really uh how you would make a flower but I just want to show the process of how you can really start using some of these things so I have this uh sphere that was made it is a solid um I'm actually going to hit s for scale and then uh hit control because I want to scale by the center and I'm going to elongate this uh and just create something like that and then I'm going to make a copy and I'm going to pull this up just a little bit doesn't really matter how far and now this I have two egg shape looking things I'm going to grab the top one hit alt V for subtract and subtract the top one from the bottom one and there you go we just kind of created uh this bll shape and so that's uh you know one of the ways we can create this this kind of bll shape and we can stretch it and move it and do whatever we want to do and kind of create this pedal so that's how all of these were created and this was just simply uh then rotated up um you know and then you can start uh rotating it around you know however you want it to do uh let's just go uh you know something like that so that's kind of uh all how it's done and then you know maybe to create a leaf we're going to uh kind of want to create a compound curve so I create this uh elliptical kind of shape and just simply push pulled it and then maybe we have this uh curve in the other direction so we will uh move those on top of each other select both and we will run our uh uh split uh actually yeah sorry intersect is what I'm looking for where's my there it is intersect command and so there is this more complex shape and we can put it all together and turn this into a flower so just a fun quick little way of starting to see how these can really be used uh if anyways into woodworking we can uh show you how all these work uh creating uh different uh connection joints and all that sort of stuff so uh we can create a dovetail now uh this is not the technical size this would probably split the wood but not the whole point of this I'm actually going to uh select uh this top piece and we are going to use our uh trim command so now I can trim this top piece to this bottom piece and you can see this bottom piece now has the uh piece that will accept the Dov tail and then this one that goes in uh we can kind of play around with doing uh a half laap if you will so I will move this piece over and we are going to subtract this from this board and then we can move this piece over and we're going to subtract this piece from this board and now we have a half laap connection and if you really want to get fancy uh I created this uh Square Square Peg and we'll put it right there in the center uh and we will uh again use our uh intersect and so um excuse me our trim so I'm going to trim this from this guy and then I'm going to trim this from here and so you can see our Peg still exists and then on this board you see we now cut the hole out for the Peg and we cut the hole out for the peg so there's uh our half laap with a uh Peg connection so we can uh kind of continue and do more of the same I mean really uh these are just more kind of uh uh doveet tailes if you will uh so we'll subtract this out and then we'll move this over and we will uh trim that so now you can see I have a half laap uh dovetail connection uh and uh we'll just do one more and kind of show you uh you know it's just something kind of fun if you really want to get uh crazy in your detailing if you really needed to uh you see I have this screw that's modeled and I have this block of wood I can take this screw and hit alt V uh excuse me we're actually going to not subtract we actually want to do a um uh an uh and intersect so we're going to select the screw and intersect with the block of wood uh it didn't work out the way I was expecting it uh let's go copy the block of wood and then we're to subtract the screw from the wood there we go and we're just going to come in here and get rid of that piece and so now you see see I actually have a screw hole in that block of wood and I can copy my screw over and now you have if I go to x-ray mode you actually have a screw in the block of wood now I generally would never model this but just kind of want to show you what happens so again we can even do it here I'm going to hit alt V and subtract this screw from this block of wood and you can see that quickly we just modeled all that geometry into here uh one last little example before we jump off into house so I have this uh lattice here and we have this arched opening in a wall and we want to cut the lattice to that this could be a very timec consuming uh thing that uh just would have taken forever to do without solid tools uh and just show you how I made the lattice this is a group uh solid uh group here and this is a solid group um I just simply copied this over you know however far you want to copy it uh let's go like 10x and copy this up 8 in and 10x and again you can make uh however much you want and then we can grab all of these things alt C and that unions them all together into one piece of geometry so that's now a solid I'm just going to erase that because I already have this one built and then I'm going to slide my lattice into my uh recessed opening and we'll drop it right there and if I hit x-ray you see I have all this extra geometry sitting inside there and I want it perfectly cut to my opening so I'm going to grab my wall I'm going to hit contrl C I could use the uh uh intersect command but I'm just going to use subtract because I want to be able subtract the wall look at what happened and then we'll put the wall back so alt V for subtract so I'm subtracting the wall from my lattice and now we have a perfectly cut lattice and then control shift v i can paste my wall back in place and I now have uh the perfect geometry very quickly so hopefully you can see through all these examples that we can create really complex geometry really quickly and make edits to things really quickly uh so we're now going to jump into building a house we're going to kind of bring all these pieces together of how we create our uh the core of our daily workflow in our office so jumping all the way over here uh I have some outlines of the beginnings of a house uh and I have a ground plane that uh will be putting the house on and will show you lots of things of how this kind of all comes together so this comes from a floor plan that I put together uh in AutoCAD and just created uh poly lines and EXP Ed those out so this is just an outline of my house uh the insides really don't matter right now for what we're talking about so here's my workflow of How I build the core of every house that uh I do including all those examples uh you saw at the beginning of this presentation so looking here what's really happening if I go into this group is I have uh this is all interior this is a connector and this is all interior this is an outdoor shower this is a porch and this is a porch so I'm going to select everything um and here's another fun little uh extension if you're not using it huge timesaver uh I selected all the lines and then on my keyboard I'm going to tap the plus sign on the number pad and I can instantly create faces everywhere uh to do that uh if you go to uh the uh extension Warehouse uh this is going to be uh uh the uh anot uh makef face excuse me if I mispronounce her name she's absolutely incredible the number of um extensions she makes that are so mind-blowing it's just amazing so hopefully I uh doing Justice uh in pronouncing her name regardless uh this one here this uh Eno uh face creator this plugin here is absolutely incredible and it's free so this is where you can download and ex uh uh install that one and again uh I just simply went into uh window preferences and if I go uh type in uh actually I think it's face creator so you can see extensions andent off base Creator and I just added in my number pad plus sign just because it's an easy one for me to use so that'll bring us to here so uh we had talked about that this is my interior this is actually a courtyard this is um uh a uh front porch and this is a back porch and this is a uh shower so I'll show you how that all comes together so how do we put all the pieces we've talked about together into one uh system of workflow uh using all of the clean commands the solid inspectors and the solid tools well uh I'm going to first select what I'm calling the interior or the the shell of the house I'm going to double click that cuz again we talked about selections if I double click the face it selects the face and all the lines that wrap around it uh and I'm going to hit Control G and that turns that into a group I'm going to do the same thing with um this porch double click contrl g double click contrl g double click contrl G this is actually a courtyard so I don't need that one so I'm going to delete it now let's start with the house I'm going to double click to get inside this group and I have this plane I'm going to do a pushpull and I'm going to go up 12 in just as a a generic placeholder right now uh for my Foundation I'm just kind of in I'll call it schematic design I'm not really putting Footers in or anything of that nature but I do like having a thickness for the flooring for my house itself uh just generically using 12 in right now but you can see these lines popped up uh if I hit shift H which I use as hide rest of model if you're not using this uh it's a fantastic uh uh little shortcut to where you see I have the rest of the models here if I all I'm doing is tapping shift H back and forth where I can either focus in on the group I'm working on or I can reference the rest of the model so sometimes I don't want the rest of the model and I just need to focus in on what I'm working on other times I need to do references so you see these lines right here uh were drawn because the overall line was split due to this uh porch piece being here well uh what's a quick way we can get rid of that we've talked about it if I hit control a and then uh hit my uh cleanup three command which uh again I believe is extensions clean up three uh or uh run my shortcuts you see all those lines instantly go away so that's where putting all these pieces together creating a systematic workflow uh allows me to uh be consistent in how I work and so everybody knows what to expect uh when they open the model um my goal that I always talk about with my team is we're creating a formulaic process process that gets us 80% of the way there the other 20% is just the custom pieces that we need to do to make the process work for that particular project so that 80% it just gets us there and then we just fill in the rest and that's it so now to make uh my exterior walls uh we work in Florida where pretty much everything we do is 8 in block wall and then we usually do a 2-in furring on that block wall so I'm simply going to do offset I hit o for offset and I bring it in I let go and then I type in 10 enter so I now have a 10-in offset around the whole perimeter of this house uh I'm going to push pull that up and I'm going to go 12 2 in to create a 12T ceiling on the ground floor and done so that is my foundation and my uh ground floor walls at least the start of it uh so now I'm going to go into this back porch area I'm going to double click it and if you remember the house we pulled the house up 12 in for the porch I'm only going to pull the porch up 6 in uh because I just want a 6 in slab there for right now and from a water intrusion standpoint I want a 6in step from my house down to the porch and all that good sort of stuff so that's why I'm modeling the porch separately In This Moment uh so that now is that piece and I'm going to come to my front porch do the same thing I just want that 6 in and similarly for my shower I'm going to want that 6 in now I want all this as one piece I don't want all these individual pieces uh I want to bring all these together so the easy way to do that now is by using solid tool because each of these are perfectly built solids I'm going hit alt C for my union command um or excuse me for my uh outer shell command and it doesn't really matter where I start I'm going to start with number one and then click on my walls click on my porch and then click on my porch and so you can see that this is now all perfectly combined so if I undo and I'm going kind of do this from underneath because you can see uh again individual individual individual individual if I hit alt C to do my uh uh outer shell as soon as I click one to two you'll see these lines will go away because this is now unifying this as one piece if I click here that unifies if I click here that unifies so now we have uh a and this is all still perfectly solid we don't have to do anything different uh now this is a group within a group and if I try to do a solid you'll see it says this is not a solid and if I run uh F3 to do uh my solid inspector uh it's telling me there's uh you know lots of reasons why let me hide up I still had these lines in here so I got to get rid of those line so that's one of the reasons so uh if I undo whoops I'm going show you what's happening if I hit F3 it's saying hey there's 12 stray edges as well as a nested instance it can fix the Stray edges but the nested instance it can't and the nested in uh instance all that means is I have a group and if I go into the group I have another group so solid tools does not like groups within groups when you're interacting with solids uh I'm going to hide this group real quick and you'll see I just have all these lines left over from the courtyard that's where the um all the lines were coming from that it found I'm going to delete those and get rid of it uh unhide and now here if I explode this so this is back to loose geometry but that's all still with inside this container and if I run it everything is now a perfect solid again so that is my ground floor all right so let's let's create a second floor which is what I have here so I'm going to just move this guy up and uh inference it to the top of this wall and I'm going to move this over uh I believe it's a 100t that I had it placed so you'll see that this kind of fits perfectly over top of here uh and we're going to kind of do the same thing again I'm going to select everything and I hit tap uh my plus sign to make all my faces I'm going to turn this into a group and this into a group so now this time uh when I'm interacting with here we generally use 24 in for uh our interstitial space to allow for mechanical and all that sort of stuff uh again here in Florida so I'm going to do 24 in uh do my same 10in offset and maybe we'll just do uh 10t uh ceilings on the second floor so I'll raise this up foot2 and then here the this is a balcony I'm going to double click this so since I want a 6 in Step uh I'm going to raise this up 18 in because we did the other piece 24 in and then I'm going to Union or excuse me um uh outer shell these guys together combine them and so now that's all one piece and again since I'm a group within a group I'm going to explode this and then come back out and now you see we have our house perfectly our second floor perfectly sitting over um our uh lower floor uh and we're creating you know our covered uh entry here and all that good sort of stuff now you can leave it like this for now a second floor and a ground floor and there's reasons why you can do that but since we're talking about solid tools I want to take this a step further and I am going to Union um or excuse me I keep saying Union really I mean outer shell so alt C and I'm going outer shell the top piece to the bottom piece and you see those lines go away because these are now perfectly uh connected uh uh pieces so if I so that we now have a perfect uh perfect shell going on uh similarly I'm in the design we're getting into design I don't really need to do too much of that right now but let's actually uh I want to draw a window right here just to kind of show you how I would do it now I have all kinds of uh my window blocks and if you guys uh uh are interested I'm actually doing a whole uh Dynamic component seminar as well at base camp um where I'm going to be talking about all of these um these uh Dynamic components that I make but I'm I'm going to grab my window here I'm just going to drop this in here and really the dynamic component I can uh let me I'm just going to move this over here uh I'm going to show you what's happening so if I drop this in here here's my window and I can say here's my component options this is a single window that is 30 in wide by 72 in tall uh say I want a double window so I can change the number of Windows from 1 to two click apply and I now have two windows if I want to change this to a 36in wide window I can do that if I want to change my moons I can do that so this is just a dynamic uh component doesn't really have anything to do with this specific class but just want you understand what it is that I'm currently doing over here with this window uh because I am going to move the center uh let's find a let's find my Center so it goes there and then I'm going to grab this and I'm putting the head of the window at the floor so then I can move it up uh I'm going to put the head of the window at 10t or 10 foot2 for my use uh and now I want to create a window that kind of goes all the way across and you'll see why this is important in a second so I'm going to make this let's see here uh how what is this distance this is 18 ft so if I do uh let's go six 3T windows that are 10 ft tall yep perfect I got a little too a little bigger because of frames and that's okay we will we'll just knock this down to like a 34 in and that's fine so what I want to do now now that I have my window getting back into solid tools show you how I do windows uh and this is a whole bigger discussion we can get into at some other point but I'm going to trace over my window and I'm going to push uh this in so now you see I'm creating a block that's the exact size of my window and then I'm going to use my subtract command and select my wall and you see I've now cut out that window from my wall so so that's how I use solid tools and I've created you can see this recess that I've created where this window goes because in this one I actually want to create like a kind of like a a sop an exterior sopit if you will so I'm going to push this down 12 in uh triple click this Control G to turn that into a group so now I have my wall group and I have my sopit group and if I hit alt C and join those two guys together uh I have now created that and now maybe I want this sofit down another uh to really clean this up and we can do that so hopefully you're starting to see the process I'm modeling my house but I'm doing everything through solid tools and you can see how I can bring everything together so that's the process of how I will model uh Model A house it's just more of the same throughout uh similarly uh I believe my stair exists uh if I remember correctly kind of like right here so I'm just going to uh kind of eyeball this for a second 8T by 10 let's say that's going to be my stairwell uh opening and I'm just going to push pull this down doesn't matter really how far just as long as uh I'm not hitting the ground floor so contrl G and if I go underneath inside of here uh you can see this is that box that I just just made and so I'm going to subtract this from my house and that just now creates a really nice clean uh stairwell opening so this is how I model this is the process and this is why modeling in solids is so important that I can keep things really nice and clean and uniform um we're going to build a roof and I going show you how I use solid tools to build a roof but we're going to do that in just a minute because first uh I'm going to move this house over top of um my uh site we'll call it uh and I'm going to move my house down uh 4 in whoops went the wrong way oops I'm going move this down and I was going to move the top of my porch flat with the ground and then make be up uh 2 in so now if I go to x-ray mode you can kind of see that my house is embedded into the ground by 4 in so uh why is that important well if I double click on my ground plane you see I have grass and everything is going to go grow around my house uh this is a solid and that's how obviously I build it because I do everything in solids so now I can uh create a cop of the house and then subtract the house from the ground plane and you see I can instantly cut out the exact shape of my house in my ground plane and then paste in place and now I have a perfect outline of the house to sit on because again everything is done through solids and this is how I build uh and so I even have a this is kind of like a a reflecting pool if you will so let's build a uh pull real quick and I'm going to show you that so again I'm going contr a uh hit tap uh plus sign to make this a face I'm going to push pull this down I'm just going 48 in because this is just going to be a thin reflecting pool I'm going to offset in 8 in for my walls and then maybe push this down even just like 24 in uh and then I'm GNA make a copy of this bottom and uh come back out so this is uh my solid pool I'm going to paste in place that bottom plane we'll pull this up match the top and maybe bring it down an inch and we'll turn that into a group because everything should always be a group I'm going to match uh the material here and paint the inside of this water so there's my pool with water and let's move this over over uh to my house uh you can see the design of this is that uh the house has this kind of little bridge that goes through everything but you can see we have a couple of issues going on a I have a a very moldy pool right now cuz I have all the grass growing through and that's not good uh and I also have water and this pool going through the house so we're going to use solid tools to clean all this up right now so I'm going to start with uh my pool and because the pool has this indentation on I really want to select this bottom face and create a new solid all that and I'm going to show you why and then first I'm going to start by not doing that I'm just going to select my pool so this guy right here I'm going select it contrl C to copy it contrl V to cut out the grass uh but you can see what happens is uh it did cut it out but it also left behind all of this stuff because I had that dip void in the pool so I'm going to undo and uh as I was mentioning before I'm going to select this bottom face I'm going to copy it I'm going to control shift V that pasted it into place uh I can't see it because it's kind of down below everything so I'm going to hide everything hide this and this is where it came in and we're going to push pull this and again doesn't matter I'm going to go 10 ft just to make it big turn this into a group and then unhide everything now this cutting box that I just created alt V onto my ground plane and because we created a full mass that now perfectly cut out um everything and left nothing behind so there we go we just cleaned out the pool great uh now we have to edit the pool to conform to the house because you can see the pool is actually running through the house right here uh and we don't want that so I'm going to um select my house and in fact uh I know we just made this ground or or the thickness of my I'll call it my Foundation 12 in I'm going to pull this down just a little bit more I just need some depth in here uh contrl C and I'm going to cut out the ground again just to add a little bit more depth uh and actually you know what uh we can go I'm going to undo that uh I'm going to pull it down 34 in I believe it is just so we can match the pool perfectly there we go um so paste that back in place so now I'm going to uh select my pool and I kind of want to work in an is ated world so I'm going to double click all my walls crl a contrl g cuz I want to turn that back into a solid and I want to work with a solid inside of here so I'm going to take this house again I'm going to copy the house and then I'm going to subtract the house away from the pool so now you see the pool has been cut to perfectly fit this house so I'm going to paste the walls back in I'm going to grab my pool I'm going to cut the pool out of my house and then explode this and now if I come into the pool I'm going to delete my old pool and paste this one back in and explode and we just got to get rid of these little Nubs that uh did not that got left behind but this pool is now perfectly conformed to the house and that's what's so great about solid tools uh as for the water I can just simply uh click on the This Plane I'm going to right click and go intersect faces with model and you'll see that it's giving me these lines which is exactly where my walls are uh so in this case I'm just going to kind of kind come in and just clean all this up and we will have uh the uh water now perfectly cut out uh so if we come out you see everything is now perfect and clean and exact ly what we need so again this is why having an efficient consistent uniform methodology to create uh these models allows for much better consistency and collaboration um so let's jump on to the roofs and let's see how that goes so I have this outline here uh and this comes from an actual AutoCAD wall section I always create a polyline to where you can see the exact outline of like where the truss would be and where the plywood would be and where my facial would be so this is a one to one of what my actual roof would look like uh so I'm just going to make a copy I'm going to bring it over here and um we will uh again select it I'm going hit plus sign to make it into a face and I always like keeping an extra copy so I'm just going to copy this down uh you know uh usually go 50 ft just to kind of keep it down there uh and then I'm actually going to move this up 5 feet because I want to draw an outline because we're going to use the follow me command but I don't want to um uh interfere with the actual um lines so I want to be able to draw outside of it so I'm going to do a square here and here and um erase that line so now I have this roof I'm going to want to build this roof separately so we're going to do that in just a second um so I'm going to if I hide the rest of the model I now have the outline of how I want my roof to go and in reality to make this work I want to move this guy here because I this is going to be my starting point I'm going to rotate it so what's happening is this is my insertion point right here and I have that perfectly aligned with here 5T above I'm going to doubleclick this to select all the lines but I don't want this one here so I'm going to do control shift which will allow me to deselect everything else so now I just have these outside blue lines and I'm going tap uh f for follow me uh and again I don't think that's the original one that's uh I created it for that it might be the same I don't remember but either way you want to use the follow me and and then if I tap this face it quickly builds the outline of my roof I can double click this and get rid of it CU I don't need that anymore I'm going to select the whole roof and move it down 5T because remember we moved it Up 5 feet uh and now you see we're sitting perfectly on the beam so we now have the beginnings of a roof how do we finish this roof and how do we finish this roof using solid tools well I'm going to turn this into a group because we're going to have multiple groups of roofs within this uh uh kind of group being if you will so to now let's go into this group and I'm going to draw this line and by doing that that will fill this Gap in I'm going to select this and contrl C to copy it I'm actually going to undo what I just did and I'm going to come back out so now this is back into being its own own solid group and I'm going to paste in place the outline that we created I'm going to push pull that up and I'm going to match it to the height of my current roof triple click this contrl G to turn that into a group and now I can alt C and outer shell this piece to this piece and we've now just filled in that doughnut hole if you will uh so we have the beginnings of really clean roof so now if I double click and I want to edit the loose geometry and we're simply going to start drawing a line and I'm going to uh So I entered 0 one now I'm going to start kind of going backwards and hold shift which will lock me on that inference and I'm going come across and tap the other side and that will give me my peak of where those two would intersect and come down and draw and we will do the same thing on this side go up here click and we can click that and click that so there is that part of the roof and we're just going to do more of the same intersect there to there and then this one do more of the same click there to there and we now have our completed roof but we have this uh information if I go to x-ray mode you see there's this plane inside of here that I don't want I can go through and say erase erase erase erase erase all that sort of stuff but it's timec consuming and I'll show you a fun little trick I'm going to rightclick any one of these planes and go to hide and you can see we're now looking at that plane that exists I'm going to doubleclick that and then click delete and by doing that that erases everything and will actually uh reow this missing piece and we now have a perfectly clean roof um and this is still a solid uh this is a a mirrored house so we are going to draw that line and I'm just going to rotate this roof 180° um oh it's a little off and that's because the front to back it's mirrored left to right but not uh front to back and we're just going to put that back into its right place so now we have uh the left and right side of the roof perfectly made so the middle piece why we didn't do that one is because I'm actually going to do a popup roof here so uh I drew um the rectangle I'm going to offset this again 10 in delete the interior and I'm going to push pull this up 24 in because I want to create a uh 24in beam change I'm going to turn that into a group contrl x uh I'm going to come back out and going into my wall group select all contrl G to turn that into a group control shift V to paste that in place and now I can um outer shell these guys together and you see by doing that everything is perfectly clean and align my beams are created everything uh so then I can explode that come back out and this is now my solid again so that quickly we can build um essentially a raised beam now the alternative method and why this works so well is otherwise if you come in here and this is all loose geometry and if you were like okay let me draw this and this uh cuz we got to close the off uh and then delete this delete this delete this oh well okay something weird is going on like um so let's delete and delete uh now we can push this up 24 uh then push this up 24 you can see there's just so much more effort into uh loose modeling versus uh working in solid tools I don't have to worry about any of that uh just in real time I can do that so much quicker and to get into the roof we will uh draw this outline because I need that outline and we are going to I'm going to turn this guy into a group and select by my insertion point and the reason why I turned it into a group because I didn't want this geometry to attach to this geometry because this is loose right now now and again I'm going to move this up 5 ft I'm going to grab all of this geometry and go into here and paste so again this is moved up 5T because I don't want this to attach to this and 5 ft is just a generic number I use uh now I can uh do the same thing we did but I'm going to try and play the chess game here and think through this and make even making this a little bit easier I'm going to undo and I know I'm going to take my since this is just a pure rectangle I'm going to take my shortest Edge and I'm going to draw a vertical line and I'm going to touch my angle because that will create the perfect Peak and then come down and then we'll draw this line all the way across and we now have an exact size of my roof to the small point and what does that get us well when I select this face and then follow me and click here you see it builds a perfect roof in one shot I can get rid of that I'm going go to x-ray mode and it always puts this little plane right here in the middle so we'll just clean that guy up real quick and we will move everything uh back down 5T and there we go we are mostly done with a uh roof even with a raised beam and everything and so you can see how those all come together now we got to clean all of this up uh and we can do that pretty easily and we'll show you that right now and uh if I hit x-ray mode you can see I have uh you know this uh sopit running through the house and running through here so it's not quite done but so we have two steps left uh I'm going to edit this roof and simply draw a line from these inter sections and if I grab this point and start moving it and then hit shift to lock it on reference and then tap this face that will create a uh perfect Ridge line and since uh again we're mirrored we'll do the same thing on this side and go to there to there so that is step one if I go to x-ray mode you see that it's mostly there we still have this roof going through this roof uh and just to show you what happened all we did was just add that piece on really quickly Now using our solid tools I can join uh this one with this roof with this roof so now this is one solid roof and if I go to x-ray mode you see all of that uh geometry is now gone and we now have a perfect clean roof uh and so uh uh that's everything we were looking for uh and it's still a solid so if I come back out there is my house uh with uh and a onetoone match of what my construction detail would look like so my house is perfectly built etc etc now uh we can dive more into the same stuff um but um what I want to really get into is now getting into the power of editing and we'll kind of end there and really what I mean is okay so we can since things are solid if we needed to let's say redesign uh this portion of the house and we want to do something over here uh I can draw again what I would call a cutting box and I'm just going to kind of overlap the house turn this into a group and then subtract this from this part of the house and now I can start modeling something new now that might not be the best example because it's always easy enough just to come in and edit this but it's just showing you what can be done now where it really could have power is okay what if the client is hey I like this roof but what would it look like if we had Gable roofs on the sides okay well that is a little bit more difficult how do we start manipulating this back into a Gable do we push p pull this over um you know how do we start uh eliminating all of this and it's just a lot of work uh so since this roof is a solid again I'm just going to build this generic cutting box turn this into a group and I'll grab it and uh click on uh any point in the roof really and I like hitting the Ridge and I will now subtract here from here and we've now got rid of all of that geometry that was kind of in our way and we can push pull this over to here so now this is not a perfect uh gable roof but uh we still some editing to do but we can quickly show okay hey this is what it would look like if we had a single Gable there um you know well what if we want to see the Gable here so again if we were to try to edit this I mean that would be a massive amount of editing and lines and it would just be brain damage so uh let's create another I'm going to do a skinnier kind of uh box here turn that into a group and I'm just going to drop this guy onto here and let's actually scale this and what I want to scale it to is I want to find somewhere in between that's past this eve line but still kind of in between here uh so now we will uh subtract this from here and I'm going to explode and then shift G because that allows me to turn both of these back into their own uh groups uh so now we can just come in and uh push pull this guy to here and we will then push pull this guy to here and we can quickly say okay well that's how a Gable on this side would look and this is how a hip would look on this side um and then once you really start getting into okay we really like the Gable how do we uh you know we we then can use solid tools and uh inferencing and all those good good sorts of things to actually build um uh a real Gable trying to inference it's not inferencing but I'm just going to grab this line I'm make a copy so I'm going to show you kind of one last thing I grab this and I'm going put this here and I'm going to just erase these extra lines uh this triangle here I'm going to copy it and then I'm going to push pull in 8 in and because then I want to come back to my walls turn that into a group paste in place and then push pull 8 in cuz this is now going to be my rake beam uh and turn that into a group and since these are now both solids we can join these together and we now have a uh perfect uh wall for our Gable so then we can start playing with um you know how this would all really start coming out and I'm just going to do this quickly even though this is might not be fully accurate I would get into a whole other level of modeling uh The Gables but just kind of wanted to show you you know generically what this might look like and I'm just going to do the one side just push pull this up or extend that line and then we can push pull this out you know however long you know maybe it's 8 in to there and then you know we have a I don't know why that's not inferencing but that's all right let's do this so again do that and and so again this is not a technically correct Gable but that's a whole other lesson so now you can start to see how we oops sorry about that uh how the Gable would work and we would you know kind of make that out in fact really what I would really do is create a jig of these extensions as its own solid and glue that to here using my solid tools but so anyway that's kind of everything that is going on with solid tool tools uh I know it's a lot of information and it's more about a process than the solid tools themselves um and how you start using all these tools holistically together to create a system in which you can model that allows for consistency and teamwork and effort and all that good kind of stuff that comes together this is my methodology uh love to hear any uh questions you have you see me around base camp more than happy to kind of talk through anything so uh just to end everything you know we did all of our demos um so there are some uh resources that are worth kind of um jumping into so the SketchUp help center in general is great they have a ton of uh information there uh this link brings you directly to uh they have a whole tutorial on creating complex 3D shapes using solid tools so that's a good one uh this is the link to uh the cleanup 3 and solid inspector and the link to uh loose to groups so you know you have all those resources uh so again just thank you just more information about uh us you can scan this QR code to give some feedback
