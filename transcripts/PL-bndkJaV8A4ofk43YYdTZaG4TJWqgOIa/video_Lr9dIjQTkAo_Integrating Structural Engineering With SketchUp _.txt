[Music] [Applause] what's got good get sir see a lot of M bases out there all right so uh welcome to B integrating Structural Engineering uh with architectural we've got myself David Zachary otor of Zach re engineer mix sold sure you all heard of and then Jess gr our senior project engineer and today we're going to go through uh how Nick prepares his structural model or architectur models and before he sends them to us we integrating the structural portion and how we coordinate together that we've got a lot to go through uh we're go through the architecture process or NW will um Jesse will go through how we set up our Scripts our our layout templates show you how we build the structural law and then we would be some coordination with with nit and and how we go back and forth and we can do this uh from anywhere in the RO so with that I will give it to Nick to go through his process architectural recovery for setting out to the each you forra so uh a little background on this project this is a project inside the town of trucky which brought along its own set of issues because it's on a pretty steep slope as you can see it's it's about between 10 and 15% uh the first thing the client asked me when I'm you know grabbing the initial information we're on site and I'm looking at their steep slope in the way said I want a driveway that is as flat as we possibly can have and and I immediately let them know the impacts of that on an UPS sloping watt meaning that the garage is going to be fully retained to the site so I I told that you that we're looking at pretty high premiums on the construction cost in order to make that happen uh on this home was an example I think we had 1,300 cubic cues export on the property and I said you know those all along with the added concrete some of the walls in the back of the garage get up to I think as much as 12 to 13 ft in height uh knowing this and you know working with Zachary a lot it helps me to approach the project to try and minimize the impact of that excavation as much as possible so as the home kind of progresses into the hillside I did a lot of stepping and elevation change within the crawl space in Foundation area so that we didn't have a continuous 12T retaining wall all the way around so that once we get past the entry those retaining walls start to rise to about 8 feet of height and originally I was thinking this is all going to help us out with our height because we have a new height restriction in the town of trucky that makes absolutely no sense and even with this thing on the middle wall retaining 6 feet in that back corner and doing an 8T high plate on the top floor and a 1in ball band Gro link game about 12 to 18 in below the building height restriction and so the town this was one of the first projects to be reviewed under their new height restrictions so I let them know this is the impacts you know we're not going to have too many traditional homes anyway it's going to have to be more low profile R they seem pleased with themselves so it was even up frustrating uh dealing with that aspect but what I do um you know over over the years years and experience I know a lot of thicknesses that we typically deal with for our floor cavity for our roef cavity I'm pretty good at guesstimating sizes of beams and getting them enough information so that I'm not going to be completely surprised when uh David the Jesse get on board so uh usually I get them involved not when the model is to this level which is construction documents uh level I get them involved right at the end of schematic design when it's really just simple opening simple structure um to get some initial studies to make sure we're on you know on course here for not only beam sizes but sheer walls this home in particular had a little bit of an issue with this rooftop deck and a large uh window running across the garage on the rake side so not the bearing side but still taking quite a bit of lad at that location so I knew we were going to have a big beam spanning right across the entire garage uh it kind of worked with the client's program they wanted oversized garage doors so while these look tall and skinny those are actually 10t Wide Doors by 11t 3 in tall and um so I think our four to floor on this is 16 ft from the garage doors to the top or middle main level and so as I always progressing through these designs as an architect in our area we have to be very cognizant of for structure because we are we are also in an earthquake zone high wind Zone and extremely heavy snow load zone so the snow load on this property I think the grand snow load was 249 lb per square foot which wasn't that bad uh my house is actually only about a mile from this home and my snow Lo load jumps up to 350 PBS per scorer but it's still it's a giant amount of weight you know we're we're talking about the weight of parking cars on top of cars on the roof it's significant and uh so we have to be careful how our roof forms work that they are snow friendly that they shed away from people away from where cars are away from areas that could sustain damage um you'll notice there's a a little roof over what is a generator in the heat pumps on the outside we have to put those under our cover or they will just get completely destroyed in the winter time in fact the generator won't even kick on if you have it just sitting out in the snow cuz once it's exhaust is filled with snow it shots down so you have to have them under some type of snow cover so you can imagine that yeah I want a generator it only costs 5,000 unfortunately the enclosure we have to do will cost him another 75,000 uh so then some people decide maybe the battery packs are a better solution than the G generator but these folks are a wir a generator and so I do try to combine them with areas like if we have heat pumps or if we have just standard condensers we need a cover under those anyways so we just make them a little larger so we can still maintain all the clearance requirements between the heat pumps between the heat pumps to the wall heat pumps to the generator generator the wall and so on just it keeps but uh that said as what I do then is I will usually get a preliminary model uh from Jesse and they'll start talking about lots of different things you know one in particular as we get down to the foundation is making sure we have clear paths within the crawl spaces to run all of our duct work making sure we have ceiling areas that have softed set at correct hikes that we can freely run our plumbing and a in duct workg as well so that we can actually service all the different areas this one was a bit of a challenge because they had actually an outdoor patio area that ended up being fully enclosed with the exception of that one opening you're seeing right with the cursor it's and so I had to run a deep sopit all the way across that space because above that was two bendless sus so we got to be able to run all our duct work keep it insulated because it's technically exterior space cuz it's not heated uh Recon or the owner someday wants to close it in so we set it up for that we set the um slab down enough that he can come in with a sleeper system insulate it and actually I think we call for insulating slab anyways but he can add additional insulation and then flooring and make it flush to the main home so it'll be a simple conversion when he wants to do that and so Jesse will and I will we'll just go back and forth I'll get a preliminary model uh he'll size some beams for me that I'm concerned about sometimes I'll ask them for one really you know right away specific so I can see what the impact is and go through it with the client and give them some auctions like that steel Bean going across the middle of the great run originally we were going to run a beam down low and I looked at the client said you want the ceiling just to run all the way through we can do some false beams up pretty tight or do you want a True Wood beam or wood Vin steel I guess isn't such a a big Span in a huge load running right through that living room and so he got to choose and be in golf even that type of detail which I think clients really appreciate we can let them know that you know there's a cost impact I mean at that stage we're not giving them hard numbers but giving them know you're probably adding another $20,000 for that Ste steel beam pushed up into the um joist Bay and now the joists are hung instead of sitting you know that all has impacts on cost and how it's insult and so it's really nice you can see um you know in this model noticed uh Jesse actually has my model loaded into it so that's how we do our coordination meetings is we just look through the model after Jesse sign size some things up and Jesse's good about saying hey some of these are going a project into the space this is where we are and then I can address it our pracher and so we'll go through the model and most of the time our meetings are short cuz we just do this we just go through the whole meeting check each space or whole has check each space we go up underneath into the crawl space to make sure have the openings that we need to continuously run any duct work or Plumbing or drainage things like that uh likewise these guys also do all of my uh civil engineering on every project um which they don't use SketchUp for they do use uh civil 3D and what is nice about what I do initially is I before civil engineering became required which is what's happened because a lot of Architects aren't the best at figuring out drainage um it is something I always dealt with so I do in my model actually before they even see it I start to physically model the drainage around the hump so I I create the swells to code as best we can in the mountain environment and um I let them know to look at you know you can see where I'm cutting you know I'll identify what this is where we're going to have a major cut in the front this is where we're going to have a major cut in the back back originally we had this as tier retaining walls and at the time town of trump we had this new rule they implemented on retaining walls that you can't go over 6 ft in height unless you get a special use permit which was a 3mon process um you know again something we've been doing for the last 30 years and had this problem so they've um pulled back on that so now you all be a specially used permit it can be done just as a variance which is nice but we didn't have that luxury so so we had pull out all the retaining walls and change all the grading and set our Ralls at 6ot Max and then they required both me and Jesse There pin the elevations of those retaining walls all the way down to the year dryable God love government agency see just the D and so it when you you're if you're lucky enough to have a structural engineer a good structural engineer that utilizes SketchUp it makes for a much more streamline process we just don't run into the headaches in the field unless something has been changed by the contractor uh we just we just don't see giant change orders anymore or any issues with headers on stairs or having enough Shear wall or a position of a window or a door being in the wrong location because they're doing you see physically modeling right off of my 3D mall and so it just by itself just ordinates you just don't run into those issues except occasionally when I have a uh a hood vent that backs up to a double-sided strong ball and then call Jesse in the field and say Hey Jesse uh I need a 10in square hole in that sherol all the way through and this guy actually while I was on the site before I left side we had an SK in the field ready to go to the inspector with the fets for that which was if you're interested required two4 inch steel plates on either side of the wall with how many screws hour is like 30 screws each sides but still overall fairly simple fix for the contractor and the field especially this contractor particular has a robotic plasma coverter so he can get the plates out to the site hour you yeah we send the dxf H yeah they actually sented the dxf for the plate and they Lo the DX up into the coner C yes exact yeah with that contractor I've done some pretty cool stuff on on decorative knife well actually they were structural knife plates um and if you guys design the ittis yeah you do it's your s new says give me a eight I uh is that M no this is a RS C this is I think before you were there at 2 you remember the B mark thank yeah and uh so we had this actually there's an old SketchUp you from I did first videos uh it's an Octan room with roof R these all 12 by 12s that come to symbol point and so the the center R steel ring is a series of these Giant Knife plates that are partially Exposed on the unders side uh into each one of those uh eight 12 White and U Mike got the dxf pile def fabricated it and I think they had it out on psych it was 3 days later it was massive it was like probably 5ot diameter plates and just fit right in place take out away with not yeah cifer yeah which they had on staff I think you that the model that you showing that's no I I I usually try to get them involved at the end of schematic design when we have an hoa's approval of the basic uh massing of the building the client has accepted the floor plan and the layout and the general look of the home and then I will get them started because a lot of homes sometimes I'm making assumptions on beam sizes and um uh ceiling joist for instance on I typically will set up them for 14in lvls and in this one I think we had to bump them up to 16s because of the span and so those are then adjustments I will make in my model to match which is nice cuz all have their model and I just you know push it pull it up clean it up up against where it hits a wall or on the eaves any place where it might have you know if if you do that you can imagine that affects your overhang Dimension because it's now a little deeper the overhand gets pushed out so I have to adjust that back to get it to the over hang that I want to have so there's always a little bit of work involved but not much um I'm doing another presentation at 4: for you know that's interested in seeing more how I design and set out my end of the drawings that I would take that many more time to let these guys go on the structural aspect cool so as Nick kind of mentioned we will get uh a model from Nick and from here it's really setting it up that it'll talk to our so in in this case you know we know that it takes a minute to to figure out how you want to set up a plane set so you kind of have to see the architectural go okay here I've got one four two fours and a base four so this is probably my mind going to be a three-level plan set um so I know that that's going the start rate it's going to be slab at the bottom you know we have the the garage so in my head and be okay we've got a three-story slide floor that's the plan side we're going to orderly and we start there because everything we do from the beginning where we're running our scripts which I'll show you in a second they relate to the components we bring in to model which we model directly in his model so there are no cordination issues there from the beginning and then all of that will talk on a three-story slot to the template that relates to that same stuff that we ran the script on and the components we brought into to model with and by doing that we've made it very very quick to go from his model to I could a day later have a rough um note taking and like wall outlines and we can have a discussion very very quickly before we even even think about design about what it looks like that also allows us to match his plan set exactly so when you're turning sets uh or turning your sheets in the actual set the corner right here is going to be at the exact same point on the page so if you're trying to stack and look or contractor's looking at the paper your eyes don't move which is better because they're not jumping you're rocking in the things yeah one thing that's really important is Nick sends us his walls are 5 and half Ines fit so two by stuff fits right in there so we can align things perfectly uh we don't have to deal with shra and S and other leaks we we do the lot of architecture firms who work with are mountain Nick don't always do that and so you have to do some work around sometimes it's in coordination before you even get stero in where's your stud guys I need to know where to put I can do it for the whole house but I need to know with NYX it's so clean we can I can get this and start modeling and I think I had schlowsky our first meeting was like two days after you first sent us the mod yeah okay well here we go let's get moving which is pretty cool on a house this size yeah are there how many Architects are in here do you show finishes on your plants or sheathing youse good that's the right answer so there are law of Architects that want to show everything they want to show too much and it's hard to get it across but if you have a contractor in the same room ask the contractor if they care in the construction documents if you're showing in the drywall and they say no I just want to know where the studs out I want the outside face of stud the foundation Edge that's what we built to everything else it gets added onto that so there is absolutely no reason to be showing all of that at the level of detail for a quarter inch plan which is what these models generate now when you I do my details and these guys as well I mean they won't necessarily show finish that's when you add all the extra material on those things that keeps the models very light fast and easy to to document for construction documents cuz everybody wants space of stud Dimensions sorry know you know huh no I give respect on that with the from contractors from FRS strange as where they come because they have three or hat to Ed it yeah and so it's it's going to vary like we don't almost have the same Shear on every be off so the foundation is always L after M typically the foundation goes on first of was to port and generally the foundation said start so everything else that sure I push back on your what why can't you figure out it's going to be this and it's going to get nailed that and I totally agree Sport with a bunch of people used to doing the same thing over whatever yeah where's the GD lot where's the grd they want the grid so they want we that year yeah see that that that begins to create so many problems with water intrusion I agree watch the sity yeah I get that push tell them they're doing it wrong no here this bony yeah no I've seen I've seen plans like that too when they put it so and what a nightmare for the contractor all your layout your pressure treated silk plate has to be as half an inch or 38 or 3/4 or in and make or how was a concrete C how was the surf if you shoot it yeah it'd be a nightmare so sorry no hey jumping any Tyrant boofer uh okay we're just going to focus kind of the stuff that I just talked about um so this is a NX blink model right and so the first thing I'm going to doing here is I'm going to remove all the stuff that doesn't really help us so all his scenes help people a lot they don't know us at all we have his PDFs we have his lightup documents so having them in the model is not that important as we're going to make it our structural model like his architectural mod so we're just going to go ahead and delete on the scenes right and we just talked about we' got that three story with a slab full okay so our internal extensions you know we Havey sub for all our various options two story slam frame three story four story and all our fun stuff but we had three story We SL on gr so what's going to happen here is actually before I do that I'm going to go to this keep mind all scpt suggest forour process it started by get WR the first point about 12 years ago and it's developed a long way since that it can do an awful lot and so what it's what is actually doing here is we are generating all of the tags that we need to match all of our templates all those tags are getting put on the correct scenes aut It Off I would stack our view cords so our raster at the bottom and then multiple vectors on top so we would have uh like our framing down below which we would fade out with fog and then you have on a on a framing page you have your beams and then you have a column on top of that so you can see the columns above the beams if you put the column layer below you can't tell what's where we use a coloring system to tell on the play whether the column is above or below so it's setting all that up it's deleting any extraneous guides it's setting up our custom Styles um for various scenes and it's setting to a par parallel projection top view and adding fog to all the framing layers I'm sure it's doing a couple of things I forgot but that's the general sense here was one watch it run yester ran okay let see no goes all V it illuminates about 4 hours or at least for project so we see it drop all the tags there that's working on scenes this heart and good be so if we go ahead and expend all these we've seen what is added uh also now we do add all of our potential steel shop layers into every project also has and created templates for that as well so every project has those in case we end up doing steel at the end but that's everything that thing just generated even on a slow computer with a bunch of stuff going on that was pretty G quick right is the seeds and the seeds and all of our scenes here now I had to put this architectural yet so hind on the rro stuff oh now it's get fre out okay give it a sec just don't push any buttons don't push any buttons it's got to be hard say I don't think out there all right well we still hear step okay so from the there essentially the same thing we've already got be scene set up there the same between the two models obviously uh CU I just ran to show it but what we're going to do is go to our internal component library right and we I look at our mod Wing right so our based Mau I know in this project in that area we're going to use a dug fur member okay that's important and I'll show you where it comes in we're going to go to the three story slab again who read three story slab script word of got the three story slap and pause I inter frame fall free story oh now this one's going to fre out to here it is oh off here but I'm just going to click it we'll turn on the layers on text you I'm not warning on there we go okay so you can see what we just dropped in here all this stuff and OB you move it out of the way I know you know when you bring things in from the component Library even if it's a bunch of components it comes in as a component we don't want that but it's a great way to quickly drag things that you want in so the first thing I'm going to do here is just explo that is not component has to deal with it and everything was already set and what we'll see is if we look at any the info all this stuff is just that we can grab to model the ly in mied model with but it's already layer coring right this is all where it should be walls beams grins Foundation takes out all that step of if you just brought some Ren component into your M and then oh I got to go and add it to a layer again we're talking seconds 10 15 20 seconds but if you're doing that for 100 components that's a very very quick right so what we'll do here is the first thing I like like to do um is I make sure I'm verifying TOA Pine uh for pie would usually the first thing I drop in at the floor levels is that I don't have to remodel the walls and I can St my wall right to that plywood and those that's a call with NI arey sure hey go that is the one exception to a rule I do show the floor uh plot because that becomes the basic sub Flor and that's a kind of a critical Dimension you get the contract and a lot of times S I like to go with h& me yeah now we know that with Nick um we get first track a lot other places but with Nick we don't even ask him anymore we just go with engine a then it deal it's just a better for yeah better see good for okay so the magic part we just go through we model this thing uh I think we saw that video at the very beginning I'll just let it run here no sorry I at your back oh I don't doubt that that's all right we kind of saw a running but we will actually go through this thing come in drop it in model adjust make unique move on that gives us control our base model before we do any design we don't use a lot of extensions we find we want a little bit more control over what we're doing and we haven't found the best way yet to use a lot of extensions to speed this up any more that goes with our process like for instance this model I I did I built the predesigned SketchUp model for structural in alade which didn't have any um designed member sizes just had base sies we know for trucky we just always start with 6x2 Doug for beams that's just how we do it we need to put PSS on the floor to match the depth that's just how we Monitor and once it goes to an engineer if your predesigned model's done that's where we start adding little sizes uh and all on that respect again with the competed Library if we have steel it's all internal we don't have to hunt the 3D Warehouse so if I know I need a W12 by I grab a W12 by La 6 nice SI being there right I have everything I need to go ahead and model what we'll notice here is these are also on the layers that are going to talk to my steel shop layers that are already been built in with that spurt that says be another stamp of it right the reason reason we do steel shs put them into our plan set is our review time is obviously zero um if somebody else is doing and this review time is also exactly the same through zero as none of it's a surprise so if we get it it if you hire sub those out the cost is nearly the same as must have be uh but the review time doubles the price because we charge to review it so is Nick it's very expensive if somebody else does it so we just had the predesigned model once that predesigned model is built or kind of in the process of we will go ahead and we will create our plan set and get it started so ranking notes or we have a thought or we get talked to Nick we know we need to do something more here we have placed a placeholder for those spots not just the sticking m in your desk so remember we were at a three-story slide structure that's the script we ran that's the components we brought in now we're coming to our templates in layout where which my tablets there you go and I know Mick only uses 24x 36 sheets that's actually wonderful all a lot of other firms do a bunch of random sizes and you have to just make through but cl4b 36 is great so we're going to come down we're going to find our templates maybe the light was 24 it 3x 42 is don't fit CER retaliated I ain't know I then you get the fun 36x 48 there I see a lot you work can't sheet up plywood didn't car any around doing denst you get your work at in right okay so we're going to call we're going to open our free story SL structure on a 24536 and what we'll see here is that we have all of our layers set up all of these Pags all have scenes they're all ready to go and as soon as I click relink which I'm not going to do on on that he was a spare freak out on this laptop uh our model is going to be here and all I had to do is mask our grids which we couldn't long Nick doesn't uh we do put them in the model and we just grabbed his GDs from his L sheep case into our plant turn our grids on and Nast point on page and then there we have a starting plate for our R the reason we put our grits into the p is so that in the feel and they want to see you know go from 2 to 3 they can scan a cure cod in the future is going to be a link to uh a website for to where you can actually play around for 3 btle and see you could really quickly go to a spot where you want to be if you have your RS you know days one awesome okay well back to the Cudo you know you used to be able open up on a mobile device and you could see these and and it was relatively helpful when you got could have us that out um real last thing I we have a touch on in the model here before we kind of move more to the plan stuff is if you're having issues five ways to solve them quickly rather than just repeating the same thing over and over uh our drafter kind of brought that to our attention like that's a really good point why are we just doing this all by hand and turn theirs on and off and running all this stuff so what we did is we broke scrip that well you saw me doing that while nip was talking now I've noticed what was going how is he doing that but I'm turning you know all this stuff off as I'm going and those are all just custom scripts to turn out custom layers on and off okay not a big deal you think um one cool thing is you know when you move a face and a component if you got turn a layer on and off you no longer moving that face you have to start from scratch right High rest of model Works still right but if you go turn something on and off and you're in some complicated little area doesn't work but we can come in here redo this with scripts I can do all PS of stuff I want on so I know how to know again we're saving not a lot of time but 2 seconds 3 seconds every time you do that and if you think of how low it cage mod some of these big structures that's several hundred times a day doing that it ends up being a lot of time whether you're doing it or a drafter is doing it or someone else it's substantial amount of time just to curs that one B so if you're my little suggestion there is you can find maze in the forums um you can email me I can punch in the right direction but if you have all the days like that this is really up the day and this is tedious how do we not do that there are ways to do it let's move on because I'm going done R okay building scr I did that in the second session as I just gushed Okay so we've got is building a structural plan with the Z layout right so let's hop back in the layout where let me open up the file um for this project um scrapbooks are very important um when for us when we're doing a plan set a lot of the calls are built in so that you don't have much to do see just a leave a little bit no I be when we brought those components in we all all of our data comes from the model so our component instance this is labeled as what this member is this is a 5 and half in just go there that's 135 that's just our c number for our reference and for jurisdiction's reference on the sign and so what we're going to do is we're actually use dat SketchUp tools to label this stuff right what that allows is when I when I first started years and years before we developed this stuff it was all done by hand so your dracor or your designer would look at a calculation set and pick out that location of where it was in the model find the c number then look at the C go okay that's a blue LA and then we come in and you go text box and you type that in you col the C member which is fine it's just another way to do it takes a little bit longer but what happens when the model changes and the count changes the designer then has to go tell the drafter okay um we change this to a 6x4 instead and he is okay I got to go back to the page I got to find and text it in and then deal with it that way but now we have with something that is linked so when you update the proponent instance column in SketchUp this also updates it's one less step one less space for information to be lost all right let up scrapbooks so if we're looking at you know detail CLS or something that's all prebuilt just for instance drop those in I can pull us out later all right I'm not to share page I know I need to strap that right we could see how very quickly we can start to build up kind so just as we go right the cool ones that we just kind of developed um I kind of blew next my hair on this one I set the first B set I'm not going to say it told me for it but we're starting to do stem elevations uh cool little thing in uh 24 is when you're grabbing uh you're grabbing leader text from scrapbooks if you can get that leader to align to what you're doing in the model it will autogenerate the text you used to you could drop it there you used to but then you have to go back and click and select it and do it but for instance now when we do this that's grab it real information from the model the cool part about go is we have it built in again this is a custom sub oh boy sorry I'll open Sketch it for all perer do that all the time okay we look at dri components who uses dri components or has used a few uh we use them for Shear walls which helps us the with lengths Heights aspect ratios we use that to label our plan also those Dynamic components but what we've done here is we've actually built this in so when I update this watch our top is down here it updates to where that doation actually is now if we step back what that means is for my out if I've then labeled this plan already and I need to adjust this elevation all I have to do is update it the model and update the G reference and the elevation on the plan set will go with it again one less place for being lost okay moving on those those are the big ones I wanted to cover there I'm going to come back to the Excel CL if we have time uh who's using Excel to talk to lamb right now anyone a little okay I'll come back to that I hope we have time uh moving on we want to look at the detail sheets I'm going to jum in and look at our detail Library you have a couple in our library session yesterday couple that I see here but what we've done is we've generated a internal component the detail Library where all of our details are housed one of our biggest problems was being able to find Details we've already drawn how do we limit layout signs how do we make layout Le so it's fewer models and easier way to flag in so what we ended up doing here is our detail library right so as we start to build a detail set that corresponds to this client Seth we're just going to pick a detail so let's just say we've got I need a four to four sheer transor detail right um let's say hydronics of this job hydronics of this job no no no hydronics so traditional flooring we use tjis and I need an exterior detail so kind of standard heater we had some fun ones with the deck so let's just say it's a parallel tgr parallel tji with a wall bone Below ad de cool okay this is all even half by 11 flat there's nothing here all right so I know that I need let's just say I need that detail I could redraw it I can use window Explorer to try to find it which I don't recommend uh but that's possible instead what we do is we build this I know the page I was going to I've copied that I didn't open my detail shape let's do that real fast and I have my first detail now I know I need the same thing perpendicular version but it was very very fast to find that detail right here does detailing for any projects you want deal with detailing for layout all that kind of stuff Windows Explorer to find all details yeah it's pain so we do this and there are fast ways to um to edit some of these details if you may have a custom situation uh we don't have enough time for me to kind of run through that but we did record sessions from yesterday so those will go up online on your website so if you're interested in more of that detailing stuff do M and see those cuz this a really cool stuff oh yeah didn't mention we've got in the company version of that library now what over 6,000 details in that document it's a 2,000 Cas stacking right and operates totally fine you can open up on any computer inter Network it'll open this SP yeah um just quick question where you are right now you pull those esail SC that strap that they're built as layout tempas they're not housed and a scrapper we'll call them scrapbooks but they are not built in as a quote layout scrapbook so if I come into scrapbooks I don't have those loaded in here I can't find them this way because with that many files our library is built into 180 different layout scrap books right and that means every time I go click this it's going to try to low all of those internally so it can find them which is fine but I really don't like sitting there waiting for the thing to load it takes a lot of time to do that it's just not super fast so that's why we developed it that way okay not that by last screen that you on that you're finding it's just a PDF oh it's PDF this is just a PDF we're using blue beam there what we use for all our PDF stuff and this in just a PDF with Hyper Leakes it's a lot of uh setting it up so that it knows where it's going yeah but yeah it's just a straight is it how did it find if PDF right here there's a hidden hyro okay right here and so when I click that I just have to remember what page I was looking at I can't tell the hyperlink which page to open layout to but I can't tell which document to open so what we're doing is I know I need care wall above below deck I just remember that if you don't just switch back to that screen normally I don't do this on one screen I do this on three screens so it's a room fect but when I get there usually by the time I get to layup it's open see I don't know which TR hyper lake is open to your layout for so it's one truck or those that don't realize temp excuse me templates Sprat books they are all just layout FS you can store them as templats and store them as a scrapbook if you like that they're all still just a lay but so and then there's that detail we need we can close this out and move on do check out that detail video when we get it up because there we went pretty hardcore on that yesterday coordinated the SCU model with the AR all nit CEST on is pretty D at the very beginning uh it's hard for stuff to get lost or step through be forgotten in a plan set because we build it straight into his model I will send him to model he will drop it into his current model spin around see anything's protruding what not if he doesn't see any problems worked out that's the entire herination he he would Barn all the holes he lost from my dce yeah yeah then one of the last things I be when they finish their model that is I do one more round it's us a the last than establishes all of the fation for the sizes and uh so and update my model to make sure it's Antion s for not that I Dimension and what I like my section cuts to be to make sense so there's a giant pertaining W footing I want my section cut to reflect it in natural because know oh it's the engineer's fault I mean it's we're dealing with homes that are very custom very complex and there's always one or two little things that just oh wait we have an interior designer on the job they're not here but it's happens on every project there's stuff just Sal there get out just the the you know the reality is there is no such thing as a perfect set of drawings there never will be uh and occasionally little things like that slip thankfully that would is a you know pretty minor item easy to fix if we delete all the ovens and Furniture we we try probably is as best he can usually cabinets um with naked is not that big a deal some of the other firms don't layer quite as well and so you'll delete something and then go where the heck's the Flor cavity yeah why was that on cabinets I don't get it so then you have to go back and find it and we do what you're doing and eventually you just say okay forget it we're just going to leave the geometry and deal with the near file yeah uh rather than trying to clean up on our files but yes technically that would have been my responsibility to say hey this is a problem going to be here when you yell with a different firm and say to Pang your rock file you just can or and then just BR your R schedu we we no matter what we get we're going to build it uh the only time we can't build it in it obviously but any 3D model will impart we still build directly in their model and then so that way when they send us a revised model later we can just drop that into the same point we have and then go from there the only thing we don't do and that's why we have the script version is oppos the way nit does it where he always starts his models in a template file which has everything set up we don't do it that way because we're not always working with Nick who's 24 by 36 and set up cobbly good we're working with a lot of different formats a lot of different firms so if we've got an archicad file per say that we need to import right SketchUp it's a lot better now in the newer versions but over the last decade if you try to copy an Arad file into a SketchUp file right into your template file so imported the SketchUp copy it paste it into your template file it could sit there and spin for 10 or 15 minutes while it's trying to copy right if as you have to do that for the second time after everything's already set up there's nothing you can do but I don't want to sit there when I could be drafting structure or have our drafter just just sit there going and waiting while just trying to copy where we can just see how fast that script is right even on an old computer on the computers we run in the office it's a matter of seconds two 3 seconds toss and you're drafting right I hope I answer your question rat wol anyway you forgot so once we have all this on Nick's review plan sets are out Kermit's in how do we coordinate with the field um on how bad this sure sure this is one of my favorites um we used to coordinate with kubity and that was it was great um they went under this bad business plan uh but now we we need to have something out there that relates uh the 2D into 3D so um and that's mostly because the labor that's coming up and and being higher didn't come up through the trades anymore they don't they're just not coming up through as a framer and then seeing 2D and building 3D and so they just they just can't see it so on the cover page we try to show each um assembly of uh Fe no I don't know B let's just be your phone okay get there um so you're oh like for instance this uh view here shows the steel and the foundation and we do that so the contractor immediately sees the structure and says Whoa there's going to be a big steel price in this thing and so his cost per foot immediately goes up and so there's no surprises there on the way we remove roofs and floors so they can see all the beams uh this is an interactive 3D model here that uh we can change and do different viewports that's that's our only model that goes to the field down that they can be moved around because we lost the connection which SketchUp is now providing for us I think in 2025 we'll have a link that we can put on the plan where they can scan into the phone our girl website still have a three Mars it's essential that we have those three models in the gal great so those uh that's the reason for this cover page and all the different views is just to hopefully relay the uh if they're working on certain portion of the structure they can actually see what their what the 2D plan is showing and then as as we talked about our steel shops um building those into the model if we know we're getting the steel shops up front the contractors decided they want to use us um we build them that's why we're asking for really accurate in floor elevations CU When we set that top apply everything works down from there and then we set the finished floor of the of the garage everything works up from there and so we can actually build these right into the uh into the marer and then Jesse's all let him describe how he he shows them even every hold down showing the steel shops so we have and it I think we're putting a hold Downs in the model when we show those right now we hold Downs in the model at the foundation level is now standard practice uh not necessarily the upper levels unless it's hting steel if it's Hing steel will wi them yes we know exactly where that tread broad goes it gets well drawn so when these Steels come out to the site and they should be really accurate and we found that to be the case yeah when is in Colorado uh at whenever current last April oh yeah rare rather and they're roughing in right now we did the steel shops on that and that's a 7500t home it's less than a year and they'll be done on that belt which is pretty Dar cool so the steel is really just looking at tolerance is how these guys are going to fabricate it a lot of it comes down to the setup um at the very beginning that pre-based or pre-design low is what's setting our spal if we do that right and we start putting members in then it just becomes daddy we can put our draft around this and say Here's the structural set here's the model make the model and that's the details we've designed and that can all go written here and then we can generate these steel shop RS that are down to for members down to the 16 inch for plates down to either the 32nd or the 64t an inch all right ples you can do that with cuz they're just getting cnced anyway so they're super accurate you don't really do that with members uh but that's how we do this so we look at you know all these beams here we know got hold down s these are all the red locations obviously contractors need to review these and make sure it's how want build but this is a a great way to do it we we try to get the steel because it does make projects run very Smo and we like that we prefer not getting Bal revealed and same thing as when Nick gets that model he can check our steel and those shop drawings simply by grabbing our our model basting it back into his and making sure he's not seeing something he just won't see and his cornation is essentially done minimal time firstus book you all the oration you well yeah remember it's sum is just a POS to to get see you know you're looking at Tov engineer playing to you w it can be real time consumed so I do p but he also P just d a couple quick extras I'm we'll open it up for some Q&A we're run a little bit short on time I don't want tyon to throw something at me so a real bar uh some of the some of the plugins we use people always ask you know what do we use for plug in is uh I want to say the biggest one we use the most often is tomtom's 3D text edor the ability to edit the 3D text you add to the model it's a very simple little extension and I use it 100 times in every B drawing uh enter off VI memory if you go and you check out the the detailing stuff we get out that is uh key for efficient detailing Auto visible there anyone who's Auto visible no so we know that we had a bunch of scenes set up and then we add in layer that layer gets added to all of those scenes whether you want it or not Auto invisible layer that you choose so you don't have to update a bunch of scenes after the fact uh medique trust uh we use a lot in Hawaii or areas we do trusses just because I can draw a complex truss roof in a matter of seconds and I really don't like doing that by here and they're very close I'm the Deep project I only use uh because he took the extend and cut tool out of mque trust and additive to mque project so that's the only reason we use that one um PDF importer by John Rock that's a great little tool if you've got people that are only doing drawings in PDF form or AutoCAD form but old school and can't findly AutoCAD file which get the vectorized line work you can pull that into to sketch out with that incord including all of the inations of text not just the minor one really cool little uh little PDF one um you see a Wonder in the hall she has his lockt as per demonstration it's really cool um Dale's profile bilder we're using three right now we're using that for steel shops um primarily to draw nailers and studs on top of the beams or any holes just because it's it's very easy to go fast and at the uh uh Echo distance for everything with that takes a little bit to use to Ed of the interface but once you get going it's very very powerful and then simn exporter is how we use or how we generate the 3D PDFs which we can do as those those ones we saw here on the cover page we also do them as a full page like 24x 36 those are bigger If contractor wants them we do those for all our steam shops so they reviewing steal they can look three dimensional they see what they're looking at soon or just by it's got everything it it honestly depends to your PF on fueler so again if you're using a not so good one you're limited on what you do if you're using a really good one we just notice that on this this is an old blue beam that's out of date it doesn't have the same controls and has our ni blue Beam at the office so it really comes down to the user on that questions yeah when you put your Dam compon let's say it's a 2x6 wall you PA it on to your floor plan and what is your mandate for say extending that so the the walls are not Dynamic if does it just it's a group of componds um like the walls so uh it's actually interesting when I first started it was all about Bush ball right and uh I very rarely use push bow anymore so if I know I'm going to go here I'm just going to move this over obviously a bit keyst here so I'm making a KN right I'm using the left to right box to generate or to grab that phas I us BL to over it and lock in the axes with the arrows I don't come over you'll see that in the complicated areas if you're trying to zoom in you get to a specific face it's it's kind of funky and you use highr or model it's a little bit better but then got I got do this F all the way in and fin make sure grabbing the right face and I did this one to ask to grab the top face I could just fck why I want left or right box moove walk in the access bit d that's how stuff we would love something to aate this that it just have well there's a couple it just doesn't work very with our system yet like d on Brock framer like there's some ons out there uh but sitting around and testing all these and making all what you want it's a lot of effort and yeah we're production we're not really which she have fun in skate show So eventually we'll find something that works but we can do these very very quickly when you're dealing with rake walls that gets a little bit more complicated with lot of his extensions and at that point I mean why are using extension and power ver but yeah I FL really easy in a lot of these extensions r p is not so much that's we tip p and hard to model with extensions where I can do it very very fast by hand great answer up a question all right we take yeah have you not used profile Builder yes uh could you can set up and do it again I we just started really touching profile Builder and again that's one of those ones that if we can build it in and make it work right yeah uh again a lot of testing you don't want to just implement it and then go oh crap we really shouldn't have done that but yeah no that's that's has to be this one uh say I just like your class on you can do a lot of stuff with cre kind of the C behind it ticket yeah you could a lot of really cool St uh the the walls especially you know you know you could save some time there uh but you know the way we do beams and columns you could save a little bit of time but then our layering gets a little bit weird and how it comes in whether it's on the steel layer or the wood layer or no-show layer so it's that's where the testing comes in and just you know it's on the list just haven't quite got to it yet um we're going about to run a little bit over but do come find us um we're happy to keep honking answering questions the last thing we got for you uh any links us Apple picture ofice uh you can visit our website we do have our detail library for sale if that's something when you watch the video you think you like take a look it's a lot of cool stuff on there full previews and then we also have our our an interest form for our plan bonding process we just kind of briefly touched about here talked about L yesterday that video will be up also it's just the interest for send us if you're interested give us your contact information and if we get enough interest on those we'll start producing that so you guys can use it the public can use it to make as a office architect it could serve value to you having all those zcals basically not to me personally because I don't instructural details um but you know that said I do refer trigger details so if I had something the tiure detailing and want to see how that I pass the structure I do look at their details a lot if I'm going to develop one app I might call Jesse I haven't had to yet and say hey can you send me this detail but I wouldn't have before was trash and I I'll add on to that it's it's depends on where you are because we have uh I have talked to people that really want those because they don't mean structures they don't mean structural that they're doing structural as the architect and at that point if they want to provide those details then yeah it could be oh yeah like that's what me yeah and 3 hour R choice that reir for from license structur years or said if you has that nothing else to come find out here how much you sell on the W for I think it's 1495 2,000 only we have up there right now was about 2,000 details 90 cents of details400 yeah yeah but again if you can start getting the interest we'll we'll produce and start getting the the company version outut so yeah we just need the interest cuz it's not easy to generate I can't just spell well it's Friday night four let's get by six it's going to take me weeks to generate that for it to be used on other people's computers and not just in our Eternal nwor but we do appreciate you hang out uh hope get a little bit out of with thank you a lot take J [Music]
