hi there and welcome to my presentation from points to polygons uh my name is Alex shrier I'm uh dumass amorist and I'll give a little bit background about myself in a second but what we're going to do in this presentation is that we're going to use uh Point clouds to model in SketchUp now in order to work along if you want to do that you can download a sample scan that I have prepared for you at the URL that you see on the right there you want to look for the process scan rwp in zip comes as a zip file and you need to unzip it so that you can use it you also need access to Trimble scan Essentials um extension that's on the extension warehouse and uh you can install that pretty easily from from over there um if you want to work along little bit about myself my name is Alex Trier I'm a senior lecturer at the University of Massachusetts and the building and construction technology program and I have been working with SketchUp for a while uh as you can see I wrote a book on SketchUp now it's in its Third Edition that you can find architectural uh design with SketchUp I also have a website where I post a bunch of tutorials SketchUp for design.com as well as a personal website Alex r.net where I have my SketchUp extensions I I have created a bunch of them and you can find them there or you can find them on the extension Warehouse um and download those and use them for free uh then of course I do have a YouTube channel um where I post a bunch of my videos and I encourage you of course to head over there check them out and um follow me on that channel as well so what we want to do today is I want to give you a bit of an introduction first into scanning as you can see here um and then we're going to talk about tools uh both from the physical site the scanners as well as the software site the extensions and and whatever software you're going to need to process those scans uh all the way up to using them in in SketchUp and then I want to show you as a Hands-On exercise uh two things one is the processing real works and uh iPad Works uh up to a point as well um and then uh the SketchUp modeling where we use scan Essentials and model basically right off a pun clot inro to scanning this VI is a scan of the overd design building uh atrium at the University of Massachusetts it's a mass Timber building that we have been in ever since uh 2017 it's also the house uh housing the um first ever Trimble technology lab and uh we're very happy about um being able to you know use use trbl tools for for um our our research and our education of course now what's the point of of laser scanning well the there is a need of course and the need is uh the tape measure we need to measure existing conditions one way or another um and uh this could be of course you know a site this could be um an existing building we might be doing a a renovation uh and uh outfit or retrofitting or any of those things anyways the the traditional way is of course well send the intern out with a tape measure and a uh notepad and hope that all the data that you need to model this in in your design software comes back and then of course invariably you would have forgotten something and you would have to go back out and you have to measure again and um all along uh you're assuming that a wall is is vertical you know what it isn't what if there's something that's not straight um how do you measure that uh with you know these these tools then of course we do have advanced tools we do have uh uh total stations like the one shown on the right there where we can measure any point very accurately and um that is of course great but it's still Point by point and one um you know use case for a laser scanner is of course that you uh send somebody out with a laser scanner scan a certain space and then all of that data comes back all of these these these points come back measured ready to use even if you don't need them at least not right away you know um you don't have to send anybody out with the total station again to to measure a few points that that were missed so um whether it's a renovation project whether it's a new construction project there's a really good argument for getting a a a laser scan um done and and working off that as opposed to some of these other techniques applications uh like I said could be any kind of ASU uh documentation or it could be um you know outfitting an existing building where you have to build on uh onto or at something else um landforms and anything that's not rectilinear is best measured this way because you can document that much better than than um any other way and then of course any kind of um shape you know sculptures any uh architectural shape that is not rectilinear is so much easier uh measured with a laser scanner all right so what are the tools when it comes to tools there's of course Hardware um and in terms of Hardware we have a bunch of options there are laser scanners that uh Trimble and other manufacturers sell they come in different um Quality ranges uh different price categories uh often has has to do with Precision um and you can imagine you know the the way that this works is it shoots out a laser from a central location measures the return distance or the the return time and and calculates the distance based on that and so at that point uh you have this angular Precision that is very much dependent on your um Optics and and on the um you know Precision that this tool can deliver and so then of course higher Precision Tools will have a smaller error over a certain distance than other tools so that's usually what you want to look for there then of course um uh you're measuring distances but you can also record um color and you can record um your environment uh you know in a somewhat photo realistic way at that point uh which often helps with identifying things uh once you work with a laser scanner or Point Cloud as you can see later uh things can get a little hard to identify and of course if you have the color information that that helps we do have these tools in consumer products too to some extent or prosumer in this case um uh iPads uh iPad Pros uh and other devices are lighter enabled they do have um uh you know a setup where it basically puts a a a a grid of light over your um uh field of vision and then measures based on that and it's actually reasonably precise so so for interiors for for smaller models all of those things that could be a tool of choice and then you can bring those scans into SketchUp and of course the um the iPad version of SketchUp has that built in at this point too then there are drones and you can use photogrametry whether you use you know photogrametry using drones or or terrestrial by by just taking photographs is uh depends on the project obviously but that is another way to do it um where you fly around something take a lot of photos and then process the surface of that building or whatever um into a uh a mesh or a point cloud and then work off that that could also be um anchored back to GPS coordinates and made reasonably precise that way and uh for larger um projects that is very likely a tool of choice now when it comes to software there are a few options especially now in in our SketchUp world uh one is uh you can always import any XYZ data as construction points this is rather inefficient because SketchUp doesn't process those overly well because it always tries to attach geometry to other geometry and so so then these um Construction points can become quite cumbersome very quickly but for anything that only has a few XYZ points uh that you may want to work with that may actually not be a bad way to go then you can always import a mesh into SketchUp um like the photogrametry mesh for example uh there's a bunch of 3D um file formats available in SketchUp Pro where you can then import that and and work off it whether it has um material data attached to it or whether it's really just a uh a mesh you know depends on the file format and your your um raw material or raw raw data basically then when we when it comes to point Cloud scan Essentials is an extension that's available now and it works really well and I'll show you that in a second um that uh comes as far as I understand it with the uh subscription uh for for SketchUp Pro and um you know you may want to double check uh whether it's already part of your subscription but uh one caveat there is that it only works in Windows another extension that's out there is uh the undead uh undet extension I never know how to pronounce it but it's a it's a great one for working with Point clouds uh has a bunch of processing and and classification tools and I very much encourage you to take a look at it I'm not going to be um working with it today in this presentation but it's out there and you'll find it in the um extension Warehouse if you're bringing points in and if you're bringing measures in there's another extension of note that's the skimp extension where you can uh reduce the number of points you know to based on your needs and and your you know computer's capacity so so that might be a really useful way to um reduce uh points or and measures to a uh usable size all right so that's the software site what I want to show you now is the um processing so this this would be um software site before you get to sketch up basically um and it very much depends on what your your setup is if you have a laser scanner and you process these yourselves then this would be your workflow but many people don't and you may actually for a project hire somebody uh to create a scan for you so then based on what you'll see in a second you can decide on uh which kind of classifications you may want to ask from them and what kind of uh uh you know Point Cloud densities you may want to have uh delivered and and so those would be then more your um requirements than than something you produce but after this we're going to uh be looking at working with scan Essentials and SketchUp and and um we'll jump into that so first of all real works uh scan registration and classification okay let's take a look at real works Trimble real works which is the processing software for Trimble scanners and um if you are using a different scanner then of course you may have a different processing software but you can also open any kind of file with with with this software so um this is a very powerful software and I am just skimming the surface right here right now and uh but what I want to show you is that uh you can take a scan from a scanner and in my case it's one with two stations and then register it in here and then uh classify it and then prepare it so that you can open it in SketchUp and then work with it and model right in SketchUp basically okay okay let's open a file if I go to my folder here I have an unprocessed file that um is a project uh came straight from the scanner looks like this basically there's a process file a project file and a project folder and I'm going to open those and once I have that then um I can see in here uh this is already partly processed that I have my two stations station one station two and those need to be stitched together similar to when you are stitching panoramic photos together it'll try to find you know Common points common areas and uh match them as good as as I can and and actually gets a pretty well um matched as long as it's indoors Outdoors where you don't have as many um you know similar planes that it can find automatically it gets a little harder and you may actually have to do some manual correction and this this is where this software here is is really useful but again you know you may not be the one um doing all of this you may actually be just consuming a uh Point Cloud that somebody else uh produced for you but I want to show you just really quickly the process in and real works right here okay so the first thing we got to do is we got to be in registration mode there's two registration and production and then if I go over to registration you see here there's uh a whole lot of tools that you can use I'm going to use the auto register using planes tool and we're going to just ignore this little error and um then it comes up like this here and you can see we have both our stations in there we get a little preview of those and it will look for you know planes in in this model and then match those two so um this of of course can be quite an involved process if you if you have a lot of stations and and you may want to do this in Parts but nevertheless um this is how it works and I'm going to show it to you with two stations you always want to generate a preview scan and then I'm going to click on start and let it crank away and then you can see the progress down here on the bottom um within a few seconds hopefully or a minute if it takes a while um you will get this finished and then once it's done we have our Auto registered um model right here or basically Point Cloud right here and then on the right you can see how well we did so typically there will be some kind of an error because there's an error with everything and you can read it out right here I have uh yeah less than 2 mm error I'm okay with that right now um my point cloud is consists of pre preview Point Cloud so so you know for production you may need something different but in any case I'm happy with what I got now I'm just going to close it and then in here you're going to be able to see your point cloud and you can preview it right here there's a bunch of viewing tools just to the left here as in you know uh thickness of points and and how it gets rendered and so on and so forth um we'll encounter this same uh set of tools in SketchUp and so for now actually we don't really have to do anything right here but you'll see my preview you'll see the two stations right in there and I could actually now refine a point Cloud right in here for example uh there's a bunch of ghost points that came in through Reflections and uh a clean Point Cloud you would want to remove those so um yeah anyways so that's the registration part in a very very small nutshell and then if I go over to production I can work with this point Cloud now and I have it right here and you see down there that there's one main point Cloud I can turn it on and I see my cloud right here that's everything and I do get the number of points right there nice big number as always but anyways that's that's just the plain point Cloud at this point Point what you may want to do is you may want to classify this uh cloud and it again depends on what it is you're doing if you're doing indoors there's an indoor autoc classify tool if you're doing Outdoors there's an outdoor tool let me show you the outdoor um options first which of course don't apply here but you can see that you can then autoc classify the ground building you know all of these things which is great because then later on you can um you know fil filter these in or out of your model as needed I'm going to do the indoor classification right here and then you can automatically extract floor um grated floor which I don't have so I'm going to uncheck that uh ceiling walls and remaining remaining is often the furniture maybe some people that are walking through um that sort of stuff and this way I can um uh you know process my entire Point Cloud automatically into smaller Point clouds that I can then um recall when I'm working with this in SketchUp again this is going to crank away you'll see it down here and once it's done you'll see under my point Cloud on the left here all of these um various um sub clouds and here we are okay so now you see there's still my main point Cloud but now uh that one's turned off or you can turn things on and off like this here and I can turn for example the ceiling off I can turn the walls off I can turn remaining off oops uh and I'm left with the floor if that's all I wanted to work with then that's uh a great way to to call recall things and you see here of course that there's different numbers of points that belong to each one of these and they're all classified now but you always still have the main point Cloud as well that you can work with all right so then you would just file save this um either as a uh real works file or you export it as a as a file that works in in any kind of uh pointcloud software um there's a few file formats for that but um but yeah that's the processing in a nutshell and again as you can see up here there's all kinds of other tools you can actually within here draw as well and Export uh geometry but we're going to use SketchUp for that so we don't really need to do that right here next we're going to do SketchUp modeling um for this we're going to be working with the uh scan Essentials extension in SketchUp and we're going to be using my sample scan which you can download using the information there on the right and you can practice this yourself all righty so in order to get uh working with any kind of a point cloud of course course you have to have two things one is a point cloud and the other one is the scan Essentials extension so the scan Essentials extension can be found in the warehouse right here extension Warehouse look for scan Essentials there's uh one big caveat it's right here um this one only works on Windows and I believe it's included in uh in the subscriptions but um don't quote me on that check the Trimble website for that but basically get that download it install it and you've got one thing done once you install it you're going to get this toolbar right here Trumble scan Essentials and that has all the tools that we're going to need we're going to uh look at those in a section we're going to um basically open a a file and work with it and I'll show you what all of these buttons do now the second thing you're going to need is of course a uh Point Cloud file and if you don't have one there is a file for you on my website if you go to SketchUp for design.com and then you look under SketchUp book chapter 3 because it's part of chapter three in that book and if you scroll a little bit down you're going to where are we here there we are um uh get to the section that says download files and there are a few um Point clouds available for you depending on what you want to do the uh best one to work with um without anything else as long as you have Scan Essentials is the third one here process scan that one you can download as a zip file you have to unzip it into a local location otherwise it won't open but once it's unzipped then you can open this right with scan ials in SketchUp if you happen to want to experiment with processing a scan uh in real works for example then you may want to download the second one here where it says unprocessed scan and if you don't have Scan Essentials if you don't have real works then you can still do something this first one here is basically a bunch of points that are imported as construction points into SketchUp and you can you know use the web version you can use any version of SketchUp to experiment with this a little bit this is not the same user interface as the other two obviously but it gets you going so this is the first one SketchUp Point Cloud but like I said this third one here is the one that you want um for our exercises right here and then once you have that you're good to go okay we're ready to load a point Cloud file now I'm going to click the file open button on the uh scan Essentials toolbar this is not the SketchUp file open so that's an important difference but um from here I can now browse to some point cloud data I have a real work file in um on on on my hard drive right here so there's a project file and a project folder uh ignore what's in the middle here those two Belong Together depending on where you get your point clouds from you may have them come in other file formats and as you can see here on the right there are other file formats that you can load into this but I'm going to to work with a a real works file and I'm just going to open that now that usually takes a little bit and then you see the ghostly points appear right there and once you see something you know you're good okay let's look at um kind of the my main tool the point Cloud manager here what's interesting about this point Cloud manager is a bunch of the tools that you see in here are actually replicated as toolbar buttons there so you don't always have to have this open once you become more comfortable with this you you might as well just use your uh these these buttons but I'm going to keep it open because uh few things are a little easier to see here okay so let's take a look at the point Cloud manager and I'm going to walk you through a bunch of these features so first of all up here you have the um Point Cloud reference you have uh options to you know change load unload all of those kind of things next what's interesting is uh adjusting the display as you can see right here uh they come in with a default opacity and you can fade this in and out this is also replicated up there where I have you know these little buttons right here from zero to 100% And as you work with this you will find that you will you know want to hide things make things visible uh change opacity as you go along and so there's uh real need to you know be able to adjust this as you go the other thing that's useful is this point size and you'll see it when I kind of scan uh zoom in a little bit you see here at some point these become very thin and I can make them thicker using this slider I usually like to work with um little bit you know heavier thickness just so that I see what's going on but sometimes when you have a lot of points of course that gets very messy so again another one of those things that you may want to um you know change while you work on this um the next one density uh you can kind of see a little bit actually I'm going to move my size down you can see here that stuff Fades out uh while I move around this is really important for large Point clouds uh minus a preview Point Cloud so it doesn't have as many points as it could have but you see when I change density of course I retain many of those points so uh again you know adjust to your liking I'm going to make Point size back to my middle here then you can colorize these and there are a bunch of different ways you can color these one is uh true color my scanner does not have true color so you can't see that this would be a photo realistic sort of um representation if that worked you can do um by uh uh intensity this means of course um if I have more points in an area I see a uh you know more intensity like here and here um can be useful uh station color is useful because you often have multiple stations I have two in my model and you may want to be able to identify which point belongs to which station and then there's white in there white doesn't work very well as it is here but I'll show you in a second where it's Ed for uh you can um you know uh color by height not overly useful in my case right here and then you can do gray scale let me show you with white one thing that happens with shading over here you have your your default shading of course but you can also turn on shading that's uh a normal shading where you get a little bit more surfacy type appearance you know without default you won't get that even if you have you know like these guys here so um if you do white and normal shading that's usually quite useful but there's other options here too you see of course this ambient and that guy all right so I'm going to just leave it like this here and then um as you can see here of course you know I am on the outside of my building and so I can't easily look inside there are these Cloud view options here you can click this view inside which basically hides the points that are obstructing your view as you can see right here and again this is really useful as you're working with this because all of a sudden you can look inside and you can work with the points that you see in there there's another feature here which highlights edges which is really great this is one that um you could use for example if I go here in top view and switch to parallel I seem to be no I'm not now I'm in parallel projection you can use something like this um very easily you know to identify lines and and um do floor plans outlines and and the like so again depending on your workflow and depending on what you need you know switch all of those back and forth as as you like okay let me turn everything on again um so that I can show you the next feature here clipping box I'm going to skip for now I'll show you that later where uh we're going to start modeling and we're going basically reduce all of this to a a smaller set of points so that we can work on a section of this um under clouds over here you see that my cloud has been um categorized in a bunch of different uh or classified in in a bunch of different categories where there's a main cloud which is everything and I can turn this off and nothing changes because I still have these sub clouds that you know make up this whole thing but um within real works I was able to uh you know uh uh classify these automatically which is a really great feature this works for indoors as well as for outdoors uh so for outdoors this would be uh ground this would be low vegetation this would be tall vegetation and so on uh utility lines and buildings and so on and so forth but but for in indoors this is what we get so ceiling floor remaining which is Furniture typically and walls but as you can see when I turn this off if I turn off everything but floor and walls for example I get you know uh a much easier way to work with this and if I only want to work with a floor for example I can do this now and I have myself the floor now it gets a little interesting when when you have lamps and steps and so on because at that point the algorithm doesn't really identify everything as as floor there but this is usually very useful to start modeling so um if you make your own Point clouds uh if you have the capability to do that of course you want to look for this um classification option but if you uh get somebody to produce a point Cloud for you then of course you may want to um you know mentioned this so that they can prepare the point Cloud so that it's much easier for you to work with it all right so let me turn all of those back on again and we've got this here then as you may have seen here in my in my um scan actually wait let's look inside again there are only two stations that I have there was one here and then there was one over here the two circles basically um I only did a preview scan for this so this would not be a real production scan but it's enough points for us to work with um anyways you see down here those are shown to and I actually can turn on and off the points that belong to each of those stations uh can be useful again to limit view or to you know enable view or uh all of those all right so then if you go further down here there's a there's a bit about sections where you can use uh SketchUp sections this is something we can cover later a little bit um inspection is a tool to verify how good your modeling is as compared to the point Cloud so also something that we're going to work with later and then you can transform your point Cloud this would typically be your first step I did it uh not as my first step right now but but just in terms of what's happening if you look at my origin and SketchUp right here you can see roughly what happened which is that the point Cloud comes in with the origin at or with its origin being the I height of the first station this was my first station right here um placed at the origin and sketch it this may or may not be useful and you can um you know at this point here fix it so you can basically uh see the transformation down here we don't have any transformation but then I can go up there to my um toolbar and I can move a point cloud like this or I can rotate a point Cloud using sketchup's usual tools so this is very nicely implemented uh very easy to use and then once you have it placed as you can see here now I've got um my transformation me uh mentioned here and I can of course always reset it if I need it and get back to where I was all right so there's that and then there is a few settings done here but in principle that's what's in the point Cloud manager and that's typically how you start you know setting up your work and your workflow um with Point clouds and and sketch up and and just to quickly walk you through the toolbar I've looked at a few things already so the first buttons allow you to load uh Point Cloud to unload a point Cloud um then all of these here are basically this you know visibility part because once you start modeling sketch up entities you you do need to um uh see things then next to that you've got the snapping tool and we'll use that quite extensively but you can snap to SketchUp or you can snap to a point Cloud which is really important once you you know have something and you may have to you know reach behind the point Cloud to snap onto something in SketchUp um in terms of drawing tools there's a constru ction Point tool and a guideline tool those are of course not you know necessarily in sketchup's tool set so so that's why they're here but you can um use you know sketchup's tool set as you know it or you can use all of this here next is um this section here about clipping boxes and I'll show you that in a second what you do with that then we talked about moving and rotating Point Cloud a second ago and then the last few are a great Fe feature to actually make a ground mesh from a point Cloud automatically which is you know creating terrain and I'll show you that as well okay so that's um a bit of an overview of the point Cloud manager and the toolbar um yeah for scan Essentials okay let's get started on working with this point Cloud here I want to look at a column that's over here right there in the middle and start modeling that one and in order to do that of course I have all of these points to contend with now that's way too much so we're going to limit our view up here there are a few tools to create a clipping box so you can create a clipping box from a selection I'll show you that in a section uh in a second or you can create a clipping box from the entire Point cloud and then um you can work with a current SketchUp ction or you know deactivate clipping boxes so those are really useful to limit your your scope here I'm going to start with entire Point Cloud first which is huge because my point cloud has a lot of Reflections so there's a lot of ghost points that haven't been filtered out but when you click on that you get this bounding box and you can use sketchup's um scale tools to limit uh your view it's very easy to use of course because we all know our our our scale tool and then you can you know Find Your Way in there and I can now go ahead and you know click this all the way to limit my view and then of course if I unselect I still have this bounding box right here and then if I go to the uh Point Cloud manager and I go a little further down you see here the clipping box is now listed as one of my options and I can always go back here and check it and then activate it now I can deactivate my clipping box right now like this here and show you another tool another tool um uses this first option here uh from the cloud selection now the cloud selection is perpendicular to your view so if I'm in any kind of an angled view I'm going to get an angled Cloud selection which may or may not be useful but for this I actually want to go into top view so I'm going to use my shortcut to go to top view and I'm going to go into parallel projection because Life's a little easier that way because now I can very easily see what I want to do here and I can now go ahead and click this first icon and I can just draw a little selection around that and I'm done right here so now you can again go into the um Point Cloud manager I have my point Cloud right here I'm going to make my points a little bigger now so that we can see this a little better and actually show all the points and now this is something I can work with and actually if I you know I may not need everything that's up here so I'm going to go back into my scale tool and just make this shorter and I've got something selected from my big Point Cloud that I can work with so that's that's what these clipping boxes do and um again you know you can get out of that but you now have them in your list here so you can always go back in and and work on things this way this is really useful for for limiting your view and then of course you can combine this if need be with your your Cloud selection if you have any kind of classification so for example here if I uh turn everything but the floor off then I still only get the floor remaining and for that I get the walls right there so that may be needed or and or useful as well let's take a look at some modeling strategies in SketchUp with Point clouds and you can see here I've got a section of my point cloud with this column with a circular object garbage can technically and the floor and I'm going to use those as examples for for uh modeling and of course you know depending on your case uh you may need to extrapolate some of these techniques or um you know uh go back and forth between some techniques because very often it's not just one technique that does it all okay let's take a look uh first at drawing on the model you can uh draw right on the model um by simply using any of the SketchUp tools right here and then you can just click on the model the very important bit here is uh in shined in these three um uh you know toolbar buttons on the on the scan Essentials toolbar um where you basically can choose between picking a point Cloud point or a SketchUp entity and if you have SketchUp entity then of course it'll look behind there and just draw in the SketchUp space and then of course Point cloud is when you draw on your point cloud and now what I want to do is of course start drawing on the point cloud and I can just do it like this yeah so you can use a rectangle tool you can luse line line tool or whatever this does not always work so let me just quickly show you what happens here on the ground I can't draw a good rectangle I can actually draw it a little off to the side that that would work so another strategy for this is to actually draw something in SketchUp space and I'm just going to simply draw a rectangle somewhere and because my point cloud is below ground right here I'm drawing it right here and then afterwards you'd simply move your SketchUp object and I'm making sure that I'm picking SketchUp right here into or onto the point Cloud so now I've going to switch to point Cloud pick and by doing that I can place my rectangle right there so the modeling strategy here is of course well you you're reasonably certain that something is a horizontal plane so then you can approach it this way um or uh you are you know just kind of uh re-engineering to some extent what it is you have you know if you have um standard dimensions you draw something that's close to that standard Dimension you bring it in and see if it fits and if it fits then it's very like that standard Dimension so that's one way to to work with this and now I've got my ground drawn right here okay just going to delete this so that it gets a little clear what I have right there now up here I already drew a rectangle on the side right there and you can see that it picked the points pretty well now with these points there's always a little bit of error so uh rectangle may not be perfectly vertical in this case um but uh you know it may actually be pretty close so so this is often a you a bit of a trial and error um process where you then find out what works and what doesn't work um also on on this side here I have a few points that are above the point Cloud because there's a there's a decal right there and so if I accidentally click that my rectangle would not be vertical at all okay so let's assume I have drawn this reasonably well on that side then of course you can go ahead and again you know use your SketchUp um uh tools and I'm picking the point Cloud yeah so that's good and uh use your SketchUp modeling skills to um draw this and then you can do something like this here where you basically do a push pull approach I'm going to pull this all the way down there and I'm just going to ignore the top or well I can go all the way to there at least and you have something created now would be nice if there were a way to verify what you drawn is is accurate uh there is actually a way if you go to the point Cloud manager right here and you scroll all the way down to where it says inspection you do have this inspection map and an inspection map is a visual representation whether your points uh are close to geometry and you can set of course a certain distance you know depending on what it is you want to uh set as your tolerance maybe 20 mm and then you can see what's going on what I found uh is really important is um to align my view with the surface because otherwise the color matching isn't um perfect it changes a little bit when you move around but this gives me something to work with and then again I can look around and I can see maybe up here I didn't hit the points overly well so that's one way to inspect how well you actually did the modeling and whether you're good all right so that's one way to model another way is to use basically predefined shapes you know what I did with that rectangle earlier I can do with shapes too so you could for example use my place shapes extension or you could just model U you know standard shapes like a box for example on on the side and then move those into position as you're as you're modeling so for example what I might want to do right now with this circular bit here with a with the garbage can is I might want to go into top view and I think I was in parallel projection already so that's all good and now oh actually I'm going to do a little experimenting here too I'm going to well we just change the view here to an outline so basically Cloud views I'm doing outline as opposed to everything although this case it doesn't matter that much and I picked one of these here and reset shading basically so now I've got my points here and now I can start by placing something that's already a cylindrical shape in the middle here I try to get it as good as I can I then go ahead and scale it and afterwards you know oops got to get my point CL back um afterwards uh move it and and and finish it so that's that's another way to to work here where now I really mess it up let's move this down there you go where now we can work with a known object and start fitting it in there so one um tool that I'm uh that that I know uh real works for example has and some other processing software is fitting uh tubular shapes and rectangular shapes into um Point clouds that would be really nice if we were here so I'm looking forward to that if that everwhere to come but um other than that we can always use this approach and then of course same as what we did before we can go into our inspection map turn it on and verify how good or bad we modeled right there so those are some techniques that you can use to to create geometry um based on your your your point cloud and of course you will have to uh very likely always actually let's go back and just turn our clipping box up always go um you know back out back in um um have different uh clipping views and um then work on sections and then of course work on the whole as a as a final step um so that you get to your 3D model one thing that I haven't shown actually let me get back into my little clipping box just because things are a little easier to see are these two tools uh construction point and guideline those are really useful if you basically want to measure out of your point cloud and then rather model later so if I do a construction Point make sure I snap onto my point Cloud I can just you know wherever I need to place these it'll snap onto the point cloud and I get my construction point if I get um if I want a temporary line then of course I can just draw that too and then again if I hide my point cloud I'm left with these points and temporary lines or construction lines that I can then model onto so that's yet another way how you can work with a point cloud and and in know uh in in your modeling process okay so I hope this this gave you a few options uh to create something with a point Cloud going to show you um the create ground mesh tool in a second too okay let's take a look at the create ground mesh tool in trle scan Essentials and for that I needed a model that has some ground in it basically an outdoor scan of a bios Swale right here uh let's quickly explore this P cloud in the pun Cloud manager and similar as before I want to you know pick a point size that I can work with I want to pick a shading that works for me uh I use this one for now um since we're Outdoors it's pretty good and then this Cloud um has uh all of these classifications which is really useful because I can now just pick and choose what I want so I can turn the main Cloud off and actually I'm going to hide all and just turn on what I want to see so as you can see here you know there's um the various buildings that are let me just get a all in here like this and then um you can see already there's the ground it's ultimately what I want to work with and then there's High vegetation trees uh poles and signs I don't think there's one here but then there's a whole lot of remaining so that sort of stuff so uh that's a really great tool and again this happens in the processing software real works in my case but um you may have a different one anyways so I'm just going to turn the ground on CU ultimately I want to basically create a ground mesh for what I have here and now in here I can of course limit my view uh using a um clipping box right there and I could make this much smaller that way or I can go into top view parallel projection and and then create a clipping box just from my selection and I'm going to do this bit there you go so you know depending on what it is you need of course adjust for your for your purpose okay so here's my my ground mesh and I'm going to fire up the first of the create ground mes um tools right here and you can see there's three three options one is fit Cloud one is rectangular and one one is bounded right here but I want to fit the cloud because ultimately you know just the data that I have basically and then you got to start with a cell size and it makes sense to start with a larger one uh to begin with because you can always refine later I'm going to say because mine is not too big I don't know 2 feet just for now it might be a little large but anyways so we can do that and then of course you can use known ground data um or just create mesh and you may want to experiment with the various options and I'm just going to say create mesh and cancel out of this and then you can see what I got so basically have this mesh fitted to my point cloud and if I turn the uh visibility of the point Cloud off you can see that I have a really nice terrain now so this is of course accurate most of this uh looks great has a nice uh GR on on the on the landscape but there there are some sections especially this one right here where I want to have a little bit more detail where I have a catch Basin for example so I'm going to turn on my point Cloud so that I can see what I'm doing you can kind of see it here how that fits in there and then I can experiment with a second tool this one's called add detail and in order to use that I have to get into the point Cloud uh sorry into the ground mesh and you can you can just do that like any other um SketchUp tool you just double click it and you're in there and then you're going to need to highlight what you want to refine and then you're going to click the add detail button to add detail and what happens is of course as you can see here that all of these triangles get u halfed in size and uh new data gets quered from the point cloud and then this becomes much more precise when I have this drop off this is still a drop off right here that's not caught very well but that's okay I can fix that later but but now I at least have a little bit more detail right there and then turning off my um Point Cloud I can see now my terrain that I've created with this tool right here there's another option that is really useful you can thicken this you can make solid so select make solid and you get yourself a thickness to it this is useful for for um you know creating uh well for 3D printing it for one or for um creating sliced um uh terrain slivers for uh let's say laser SC laser cutting and and terrain modeling or or the like so those are all the tools that come with this ground mesh creation tool right here thank you for listening to this you can find me at SketchUp for design .c and my other websites and of course the YouTube channel at any point and I hope this was useful for you [Music]
