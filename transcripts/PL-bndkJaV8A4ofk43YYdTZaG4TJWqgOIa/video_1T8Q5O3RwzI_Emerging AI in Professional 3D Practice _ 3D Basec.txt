hello my name is Daniel to and this is emerging Ai and professional 3D practice this session has been recorded and probably online in various places there's a lot of information to go over so I'm going to jump right in hopefully the agenda is we'll introduce ourselves we'll talk about the AI research and development mandate that the company I work for confluence provided to us we'll talk about the types of AIS and how we use them in Practical matters you could see some of our work on the screen here top image is a mid-journey image the bottom image is a lumian rendering and then we have another mid Journey on the right Confluence is a great company that we work for we work for nine offices across the Midwest and we'll talk about confence a little bit more at the digital Studio our main job is to produce 3D Graphics this requires us to pretty much constantly research and develop new methods for what we're doing finding different ways to approach how we're working we have a big Focus we have our own internal approach where we're trying to tell the staff that we're working with or in ourselves to find innovative ways to do night renderings which we'll talk about as part of this presentation and why that's can become a thing and just an example of two of our favorite projects the Jen Becker above she designed to did this Marina she worked on this and three mod 3D modeled and animated this Marina and I had fun with this model doing Lighting in learning how to add lighting elements so again my name is Daniel tall I am the digital Studio manager for Confluence I also own placemaker Urban paintting daniel.com I've written books on SketchUp rendering and drones I wrote Drone book for professional practice with John alel who was also presenting at 3D base camp part of my life and some of the work I've done as is as a designer doing belt work Urban Design work memorials T so many different types of projects I own daniel.com this is a great resource for 3D if you need it there's uh tutorials on the website YouTube links you can link to the books and I also develop and sell placemaker and urban paint which we'll talk about briefly in this presentation again because one is parametric and one is is using AI Jen Becker is the co-manager with me for the 3D digital Studio she actually runs point on our AI research and development and we do this in Tandem and consolidating this information but Jen helps me run doing the modeling the rendering the animations and the drones Jen do you want to speak about this slide go ahead yeah so we put out a AI newsletter every two weeks to our bosses um part of our AI mandate is attending conferences testing new AI generative models all sorts of things none of this would be possible without leadership when I talk about an R&D mandate there's there's real money and time that's being put into this and that wouldn't be possible without Chris delova who just recently was inducted as a fellow into the American society landscape architecture and our direct boss and vice president of the company John Jacobson they emphasize this that it's so important for them to put the leadership and say you need to figure out the AI stuff Chris came to us and said we're behind you better catch up we're not really behind but we get the urgency and j John Jacobson asked us if we were all going to lose our jobs Jen Becker runs the digital Studio along with me for confluence does modeling rendering animations drones and she's actually running point on the Confluence AI research and development so as part of of our AI research and development I'm responsible for bi-weekly AI newsletters on AI trends that go to our bosses I find and research new AI tools and figure out how to integrate them into our workflows and I also attend AIA conferences leadership is an important part of having an R&D mandate it would not be possible without these two these two gentlemen Chris delova recently inducted fellow into the American Society of landscape architecture the president of our company and John Jacobson the vice president and I'm pointing this out if you're watching this and how important it is to have leadership not just Advocate but tell you to go do this and realize the importance around understanding the AI Trends themselves so that means we have an AI mandate and in this presentation we're only scratching the surface this is a deep but shallow dive many of the own of the sections here can have their own full length presentations there's stuff that we're not showing and there's just more information that you can probably incorporate so talking about the General State of AI and this kind of prognostication and if you're old enough to remember this or if you weren't born autocad's been around for a long time if you think about AutoCAD AutoCAD ver 1.4 U if you look on the screen where it's highlighted those shapes back then with the computer tech you had would have taken 12 to 15 minutes to draw you would have given the computer a coordinate told it point A to point B to point C or an arc in a radius and then weighted broken out the popcorn so AI in the nag based off all our research and what we've seen so far we're still in what I would call the very early stages of this Jen why don't you speak about this one so ai's really kind of followed this hype cycle and you can kind of see at the peak of that that's generative AI right it's promising all sorts of things and it's kind of under under delivering so that's kind of where we're at right now as we're starting to see things kind of plateau you know things get more realistic and those the hype kind of going away now big landcape architecture firms like SWA are also researching this um and it's interesting because we're kind of paralleling them in our research as well and a lot of these tools right you see case studies on them but they don't show you everything that it took to actually get there so it's interesting to see that you know this really is the beginning of it and I think at this point if you researching it you're an expert and pretty much that's we were told at a conference like if you're if you're into this right now you really are putting yourself in the Forefront reading academic papers like project moose Muse or um online blogs like the landscape architecture AI buffer zone where they're talking about how much AI is starting to be used just in the landscape architecture or the aec industry in general and we're trying to understand those big picture Trends so what we did I think that that's important to note too that you know the design profession is really kind of behind I guess you know people are investing in AI but they're investing in really big sectors like healthcare um automation manufacturing things like that and so our profession is a really small piece of what's being developed out there and that's a great point and this is why internally what we've done right is developed this AI mandate and what you're seeing here is literally the chapters on a Google doc for all the different things that we're starting to research organizations were part of and how AI in some ways is now everywhere and again we'll talk into the we'll get to the meat about this so part of our strategic recommendations internally is is understanding how AI fits into our workflow it needs to be invisible affordable seamless really not something that's going to cause you more time or damage there is a price tag involved in it uh and another big thing about it is just remember like with AutoCAD 1.4 things go slowly so be skeptical of the types of Technology you're seeing there are a lot of AI companies now that are desperate for money you're not going to show you what it actually does and then Wonder was it worth it once you subscribe the other part of this is the safe use of AI this is AI s so SO2 compliance which is actually something that was created in the 70s and and established a framework for compliance and safety for businesses to run so that's good that that's being integrated integrated and advocated in terms of AI for business practice in the US go ahead Jen these are just a handful of the newsletters that I've put out so right now I'm writing these basically every two weeks just to kind of keep up with what's happening how we can use it if we think that you know it's hype or if it's not and then also some case studies that we put together how many hours per week do you think you spend researching for these newsletters um it depends on the week it depends kind of what what comes out but would say anywhere from two to 15 hours a week and how fast do you notice things changing from the time you did your first newsletter to now it's slowing down it's definitely slowing down you know so you know a lot of people ask how we get our information um you know how we put these things together and how we know you know what's up and coming and so we subscribe to a variety of AI newsletters that other people are putting out we attend AI conferences um this was specifically the G GTC conference that Nvidia put on in March that I attended um and then social media as well one of the topics I want to talk about just real quick because it's important to me is NVIDIA leading the charge have something called Omniverse that's a big conversation in itself um and it also this notion of digital twins which you're going to hear a lot about digital twins in the coming year coming years and it's important to understand what they are and how their their their intent is really to create what you're seeing on the screen a live action simulation representation for in this case of the earth Nvidia calls it Earth to that they're using for climate modeling weather studies you name it and that's something you're going to see more of and already exists in a lot of sectors but it's a quick shout out to this be as you come across this definition of these live simulations that are fed data and AI actually helps uh uh pursue and understand the data sets there's bunch of types of AI so I'm going to talk here and this is a this is both Ai and advert ad advertisement I own and operate placemaker placemaker started with this notion uh in 2014 of the fact that facial recognition software had now gone to remote sensing and aerial photography and we can now have access to these powerful data sets on demand all our projects start with placemaker so right there this is the Las Vegas Convention Center that we're at for base camp and it's a high resolution aial that's almost completely necessary for us to do any kind of project work that we do the great thing about placemakers all the other data sets that you can get here's open street map and Microsoft building massings and these are AI derived building sets that sometimes they have height information sometimes they don't the same is with roads we bring in the road data and we transform that into a road and here you can see all the different data sets water roads building Footprints streets you can export this back to a CAD program and have a cad base out of it I'm going to turn that was rails right there I'm going to turn this all uh back on to show this to you and say this is one aspect of the placemaker data we also get cesium data which is terrain data that we can use and the last part of it is that we are able to import in the Google Earth 3D data again this is a commercial product this is mine this is my quick spot and why that's important is because the type of information you now have really becomes these high detailed 3D models you could see what they are these are all AI derived photog gratic data from P clouds again you can go to my website for all this the next thing I'm going to show you is parametrics and this is another tool of mine called Urban pain now parametrics is not AI but I want to talk about parametrics in this presentation because AI is not precise generative AI lacks Precision where everybody's been spending the past several years creating these parametric tools Urban paint lets you create Street Scapes and SketchUp in minutes it would take hours it's parametric you put every all the datas in it's a very linear process for everybody to use there's other parametric tools I want to talk about this one's showing you how it's going to build a streetcape and an intersection but what we're going to see in the future is the the merger of parametric tools with AI they're almost a marriage made in heaven because where AI is not precise and parametrics is you know giving a shout out to SketchUp because they're thinking about it that way and some of the tools that we're seeing Rhino and grasshopper but they're not the only only ones it's a lot of the software companies are thinking about how to create the parametrics here and just to go through Urban paint it's creating the streetscape profile you can then save the profile itself and reuse it but once I hit save build the profile for me you can see it it's going to Co in there normally this would take me you know an hour or two or maybe longer to build it's a completely editable model but it's Precision it's the prec that's the Precision that I need for what I do and here I'm going to reload a profile and one of the things I can do is add an intersection which is painful to do if you have to do it manually and you can still modify the profile as it was and once it puts it out there you know so for me in the future tying AI to this tool creating other options for the way that you can create parametrics is really important so don't forget about parametrics in the sauce of AI we will talk about that in some of this uh in terms of what's next sorry okay so let's talk about the types of AI we're going to get into the into the depth of all this there's the chat Bots there's generative eye and there's passive so the chat Bots everybody knows what they are we're going to talk about them the generative AI models which actually require the chat bots in some ways for you to create this information and then passive AI which is really what I just showed you with placemaker and with other tools like lumian and D5 and render programs and other things like drones where it's behind the scenes and that's really important to know these tools all use these kind of different types of AI on the right right hand side um to generate their data information Jen you want to talk about this one yeah so this is just kind of a comprehensive list of different categories of different AI softwares that are out there right um this includes generative chat Bots and passive um and I would say that we've probably looked into at least half of these um and again kind of going back to that hype model right A lot of these are AIS that overpromise and underd deliver so the chat Bots which is prompt engineering which really um you're turning right brain creatives into left brain linguist which is kind of a challenge right um and how those work and we are agnostic in our chat Bots for the most part we use all of them here's the four major ones that we like I think it's Jen which one's these perplexity Chad GTP Claude and Gemini Gemini that's correct and each one of them you can see has a different take on what the world like in 2040 perplexity which is my favorite is the most pessimistic or pragmatic depending on how you see it um so we'll talk about first of all one of the primary most simplest things about this is the Google search bar or searching versus something like perplexity which is one of my favorite chat Bots that I use so perplexity is great because it shows you what it's thinking it gives you sources it gives you videos it doesn't create images it's very focused as a research tool has a library if I search Google and say give me the bre drone on the market I'm going to get the first three results which will be ad like Reddit which I don't want to delve into Reddit because it's 11 might or might not be good or whatever it might be in Reddit but either way the next results are all advertisements that doesn't really help you if I go to perplexity I'm like give me the top five top drones it's giving me the top five drones it's actually telling me the differences their battery life relevant clear legible information I can then ask it well what's your sources again I look at the sources I can go through there what's nice to see is redddit actually is on there I didn't have to read through Reddit it found it for me and then I can ask it well why did you pick the mavic the DJI mavic 3 Pro as the number one because I might not agree with that assessment or not but there it is and it's giving me the reason that's great that's research that's Google instead I mean it it if an image says anything else about what you're looking for for products and how to find stuff that's it so how do I use it as a search engine yes I still use Google Search bar on occasion but for the most part I search using perplexity and I do pay for it there is a free version and the free version you can't actually access the pro side of of perplexity for five times a day but this is my search history and it gives and I can go back to these and I can add to it so if people have been saying like it's a new type of instead of we've all been acclimated to using the search engines this might be a change next thing I like to write books and this is again I'm using lexity for this one and I wrote this kind of emotional plea to about how we need to improve the studio and I'm like there's no way the chatbot can outright me I yeah I got schooled I did not expect this result this was a professional memo it was it didn't necessarily get the results I needed but at the same time it was better than what I had produced and I was uh well written one shot and kind of shocking and that was an the aha moment of like okay no matter what's going on with AI maybe it is slowing down maybe there's too much investment it is legit and it did outright and outs sync and outproduce what I was I would not have been able to reach this result prompt engineering not to be confused with the actual career which is actually people that do prompt engineering tasks but let's talk about this um just real quick because I'm going to turn it over to Jen and she does a lot of the prompt engineering but it is worth to research and understand how create prompts for generative models for what you're doing Jen go ahead yeah so it's important to know how to speak to these models right and how what words they're going to understand and so there's a lot of resources out there that we'll use this one specifically is hugging face um but it allows you to type in kind of what you're trying to get it to do or what way you're trying to talk to it and that it'll actually create a prompt for you at least as a starting point and then Daniel and I will actually use a chat bot like perplexity or chat GTP to kind of just spew all of our thoughts out like we want it to do this this this and this and then it will actually write us a prompt that we can copy and paste into a generative AI system that it better understands than Daniel and I just word vomiting into it and we have examples of this in our um in the presentation so generative AI inspiration I want to start off with this one hit play on this I love this tool this is NVIDIA canvas it's free it's a basic tool that is actually used now in a lot of different AI tools you're going to see it more often this is one of nvidia's first takes on doing this kind of stuff it is pretty much you get your Bob Ross on you become a landscape painter and if as a landscape architect this is you know finger painting fund or whatever you want to do with it um it's important to know the importance of this tool is because of what it's able to do on a generative level and being able to shape environments I mean if you want to read God created the world in six days he just might have used Invidia canvas to do it I don't know but you could see this tool allows you to basically paint with a different brush size you can pick in the canvas you can pick the type of landscape you can pick trees mountains Hills rocks gravel sand they're programmed in there and the algorithm does all the work right now I'm working on the left hand side where I'm just doing this autofill with uh and just just filling up filling the areas with different color but again you can get lost in this for hours every once in a while I come back to this tool and I think it's just it's just fun but this was one of the foundational generative AI tools that came out six or seven years ago you do need a very good video card you need a RTX card to do this however it is worth it it is free it is worth the download and trying it out generative AI I call it the it's not very precise but if you get over that that's where its strength lies so we're going to go through a bunch of different case studies um you know Daniel and I have really tested every generative image model out there at this point um for work to see kind of what the results are right which one's the best which one's the most photo realistic um and which one understands our prompts the best so all of these prompts that you're going to see have been written through chat GTP or perplexity Claud or Gemini um to get a better result and these are just kind of showing you our process what the results were um and like anything in design these are subjective right there are people that will tell you in our firm that they hate these images that they aren't realistic that they could do a better job right um and there's other people in our firm that love them so um and if I can just quickly add and these these these aren't just stuff that we're testing we're using these as inspirational or precedent images for projects right yeah absolutely so we're basically using generative AI to create efficiencies in our workflow um this saves us so much time being able to create exactly what we want versus trying to find something that fits in the fits in the loop on Google or on the internet somewhere so these are all three mid Journey tools um and renderings these are all for the warehouse District in Minneapolis so we gave it really specific information on the location that we were using um you know how the space would be used and what type of things we were trying to create again these are both from mid Journey this is the newest version um 6.1 that they came out with and again this is a food truck um Park also in Minneapolis and then the other one is just kind of this fall alley type scene that you know you would see anywhere go ahead um so playing with kind of context with some of these tools is interesting so you know trying to create these images that could be seen as a drone shot instead of you know your TP instead of actually having to go out there and fly a drone um just to kind of get the point across right or to have a visual impact on a project um the other one is you know this kind of fall scene and Steamboat right we work on a lot of mountain projects in our den office and so I think being able to create context that is um location specific is important do you know what's crazy about the one on the left is it looks like tell ride yeah it does um so getting into some of these mid Journey tools everybody's pretty um pretty aware of their imagine tool which is just their generative AI that creates an image but some of these other tools are often overlooked so this is the blend tool then is showing you basically the process of blending a mid-journey image with an existing image so as you can see that image on the left is an existing photograph that one of our principles took of an alley um the middle image is a mid Journey tool that imagine rendering that we created and then the last image is those two images put together and then we changed the paving out using some of their inpainting tools called uh Berry region one of the other really exciting tools that I like in mid journey and we've started to use more and more is called tune so this is actually a style tuner that allows you to create a style just from a prompt so this one was for a style that was inspired by architectural digest um and then from there it creates these images that are seen in these grids right of three and then if you go to the next slide Daniel it creates a custom style code that you can use in future renderings um using the Imagine prompt based on the images that you select here it creates a specific style that you can then transform to other renderings that you create in the future one of the interesting things about this is that these tools are both blend and tuned are not supported in the new version of mid Journey so you do have to use a older model so we're going to go into some of that next so this is using a style tuner that I created um for an alley with you know colorful and futur futuristic stuff um but this is using that older model the version 5.2 so just to show you the difference is that this is that same Pro but using a different style code so this actually added people to it right added some fun stuff on the buildings it's a little bit more realistic but if you zoom in pretty close you can see the the people are still a little weird and that's that old model and sorry and that's worth mentioning that one of the things that we've learned doing all these generative features and we'll talk about that more is not to add people to cars necessarily in some of what we're doing and here's an example of that like this actually does work great on the right and I remember the principle we showed this to is like let's just use that right and this is wild so this is really to show you the difference between that older version using the style code versus not being able to use the style code but using the same prompt in the newer version right the people are better but it doesn't really have that kind of same Whimsical effect as the style to n version did at the same time the one on the right's pretty photo realistic yeah absolutely I think that version 6 .1 mid journey is considerably better than 5.2 and hopefully they'll support these new tools in the new version um one of the other generative AI models that we use quite a bit is ideogram and we're going to get into this one a little bit more because it specifically works really well for words but just to show you kind of a comparison versus um a prompt in mid Journey like we just saw versus audiogram you know these all these generative models are getting better and better I think that these are pretty nice too they're pretty photo realistic um that one on the left is a little bit cartoony I guess with the people but for precedent imagery or just trying to find something that you know checks all your boxes this it's a pretty nice one the one on the right again looks like a photograph and it's hard to tell that that's generative yeah absolutely um so again this is just showing you kind of some of the prompts that we use we crafted this one in Chad GTP we were trying to create a plaza area for um an Entertainment District in Minneapolis that you know had these kind of celebratory watch parties for the timber WS so something that ideogram can do that mid Journey can't do is really branding um you know logos branding words things like that and so no you can go to the next one um again that is this is basically that exact same prompt that we were using in mid Journey with the style tuner and then in version 6.1 this is just the ideogram version to show you a comparison of what ideogram looks like versus mid Journey um so again where ideogram really really shines is through text so these are all generative models um all generative renderings and you can see that a lot of these look pretty real um um you know we see in other generative models that it can't spell things and it can't um can't do words do words at all right it just looks like kind of weird jibber jabber on the wall um and so these I was very specific in my prompts I did put in bold in capital letters like what I wanted it to say right so you do have to spell it out a little bit and hold its hand a little bit but it does it does pretty well go ahead Daniel so this was a case study that I did using ideogram for our company's um logo and so you can see the top left image is our normal logo I didn't upload that or anything to ideogram I just told it that we were a landscape Architecture Firm our company colors were gray with a pop of orange and that I wanted to create a fud logo that I could use on things and it came up with all of these you know instantaneously and some of these are kind of I don't know what we'll use them for but um it's pretty neat that it really kind of takes the idea of the word and then puts a graphic to it so this is a case study where I have to create a logo on the Fly I use chat petique for this I needed a logo to go in with the other Armed Forces Armed Forces for this rendering I needed one for Citizen Patriot and I put it through the process took me five minutes otherwise I don't know what I would have done or how I would have done this asked my boss which one he wanted to use he picked this one and here's an example of where chat GPT actually could not do the spelling but ideogram wasn't around back then when I did this and then we plopped it into the rendering so here we go so another generative model that we've been testing and you know I sat in on a a conference at GTC about this Runway and AI so Runway AI is really geared towards a Hollywood level of generative video um most of their models are generative tools for video for video editing um for creating short clips and I think that they're really pushing the limits when it comes to generative video so we we have tried to get into Sora we've tried to get into Adobe Firefly we've tried to get into a lot of different generative video models and you know we're still on the wait list after all these months so Runway is actually a plug andplay tool that we can use and it's worth noting like all the every all the work we're showing you is all stuff that we were doing like this isn't from their websites and in this particular case like we're taking their a still image render like this one for example and then popping it into the runway and we simply said add people in cars and keep it you know keep the image still yeah create a tie thank you you actually did The Prompt for I should let you do that and this was amazing to us and here's this next one I'll hit play John yeah so we're looking at how we can use these tools in our everyday work right how we can win projects how we can change the way that we're you know showing up to projects and what we can do and so this was actually a video that I put together all of this is generative from from Runway of specific scenes of this kind of Mountain Ski Resort project that that is something similar to what we would work on um and it's really just to highlight you know programmatic elements how is the space going to be used how are people going to interpret things you know what does that look seasonally and this video probably took me an hour to create all the prompts for and generative time and then 15 minutes to put together in another video editing program and then probably about $15 worth of credits to create real real quick here so one of the scenes here I think it's this one right this was actually a still image from one of our projects yeah and Runway actually took it upon itself to animate the children from that so you can pick an image to start with and then it will do his best to animate it and here's another one and then I think real quick just as a joke I think I saw Aaron Deon from sketch up in here yep there he is look at that kind of maybe not sorry Aaron so again taking a like for me taking a still image render because that's what we do a lot of and then being able to pop it in here to create a really quick uh rendering of this that animates it makes it interesting I mean part of part of it here is trying to get it to understand scale but again like where these tools were six months ago to where they are now is kind of amazing well and it's it's important to note too that if we animated that manually in lumian or a rendering program that plus the processing time would have taken us you know 15 times as long that's a good point we'll talk about time in a second but that go ahead about uh delve you want me to go to the next one uh no this is perfect so delve is a Google Earth plugin that is AI um generative for planning models so you can go to the next one so this is a quick tutorial I put together it's going to show you you know you pick a site that you're trying to redevelop this is a great tool for Real Estate it's going to give you in it's going to give you 30 different generative ways of how your land use plan would work um where buildings could go where your parking lives how these areas all interact with each other and then it actually analyzes each one using AI so you can put in costs you can add different types of buildings you can add all sorts of things and it's going to give you um total cost to build it total yields on what you're going to make off of it um carbon emissions all sorts of things and then it'll actually even analyze you know things like sun sunlight um Shade Wind all sorts of things for each design and then it allows you to kind of create a plan that you like and then from there you can actually put it into Google Earth and take a look at how it's going to um work with the context around it and we have a planning department that every once a while we delve back into this and look at it with them yeah it also allows you to compare models um you know and really see what the differences are between each plan so let's let's delve into SketchUp diffusion I really like this tool um basically you build a model and sketch up and this is kind of a quick tutorial I'll jum go through this most important aspect of using SketchUp diffusion which is a generative AI tool within SketchUp is creating a detailed model so in this case all the features that I want to appear in my render my generative render are here building trees pedestrian lights uh cars uh textures for locations so I'm delineating the different aspects of surfaces and pavement and from there I can using a text prompt I can create a bunch of different generative scenes in which I can take it from there and I'm constantly refining it you can regenerate you can relight them you have different tools I'm not even getting into all the tools here I really like this render but the trees weren't very realistic to me I added asked it to do another version of it you got the paving correct I can always Photoshop different things out I asked it to relight it and it did a relight and one of the things another tool we're going to talk about here from topaz labs gigapixel I then took the final result from SketchUp and then I popped it into gigapixel which lets me increase the resolution of the image so it's actually nice and cogent so I have a nice presentable image I would actually show this to a client I didn't notice until I actually enhanced this image that it put in a background for me too didn't notice that didn't see that I just thought it was black does have some floating trees so it could use some photoshop there but that was the original image versus What It produced SketchUp diffusion has some very powerful settings that you don't normally find and one of the most important things is respect the model geometry so basically you're throwing in your model it's not going to create some unseen Twisted elements it's really going to work with what you give it and at the same time you can influence the prompt influence so if you want it's worth playing with this tool and again using I actually ran this through I don't know which GP I ran it through but I ran it through a bot and then playing with all these different types of settings there's also a negative setting to make sure that no things are included in this case I said please do not uplight the trees and then from there you can start producing these settings the other thing you have is you have other styles that you can choose from in the diffusion model exterior photo uh exterior photos interior photo uh realistic uh all these pencil sketches this what I did as an illustration from that render and the other aspect of what you can do we're going to delve into another tutorial with Jen here in a second is the SketchUp diffusion engine in SketchUp you can Import in an image of a render so in this case I brought this render in that you saw that was animated in Runway but which was created in lumian and I brought it into SketchUp and now I'm using it as just another diffusion engine and I said I gave it a prompt and it gave me option so it's not just the fact that you can use it it to respect the model geometry in this case respect the image but also bring in that render this is again a separate render in SketchUp that I imported as then use the engine for this is a pretty unique tool there's not a lot of options to be able to do this um and it makes SketchUp diffusion extraordinarily powerful so here's another example this is drone derived geometric data that we use in the train model that just then became this Jeff yeah so this is kind of that peace meal process that we're going to go through a little bit in some of the next slides but I really took this model and I put it into sketch of diffusion um and then I was able to generate some pretty cool um weather effects things like that but this really shows you the process so and just real quick note there are we do have a video there's a separate video on this on the YouTube channel on this tutorial yeah absolutely um so the way that we went about some of these other ones is we had a lumian model of that Park that we had scanned with a drone we had built a master plan model and SketchUp we had added trees people full Entourage in lumian and then we were able to export export some still images um and you can see up there in the Middle top is some different exports that we did for the alpha Sky Map and the material ID map that helps you really kind of piece meal this together in Photoshop once you're done so I took that image just the raw lumian image I imported that into SketchUp I used the diffusion model on it to get some pretty nice kind of fall more natural looking renders because one of my biggest complaints about the lumian file that I had created was the saturation and all the materials it was just really over the top um and so then from there I was able to kind of Pick and Pull pieces that I liked like I might like trees in one of the diffusion images that I got but I like the sky on the other one and so being able to go into Photoshop afterwards and piece meal all of these um areas together using that material ID map to mask certain things out was really helpful and a really quick way to get a full-blown Photoshop rendering that looked completely different from my model so this was the original lumian rendering you can go to the next one and that was the after so you know really adding some nice rocks in the river um changing the sky adding photo realistic trees you can see kind of some of the parts that are still there the lumian cars are still there the buildings in the background um all of our master plan information there with the grass and the bridge and all of those things are still there but it really allows you to create a kind of seamless image so I'm going to jump in here and talk about custom GPT Bots because you can build your own Bots sort of and how we did it someone on our firms it qaqc for construction documents so Chach PT allows you to go and if you have a I think that you need a paid subscription but you can create your own custom bots list this was a while ago I actually took my SketchUp books and information and threw it in there to see what it would do and create it sketch a buddy never used it set never used it since uh but it's interesting because you could ask at any that's going to reference it I think actually SketchUp built something in like this into SketchUp I could be wrong and then Jen do you want to explain wingman uh wingman and I create as a as as a joke basically and it's just this like funny Chad GTP that gives you funny pickup lines that I found you know that I traded on from the internet so it was kind of just a joke but it it is kind of funny to create something that just when people laugh so so uh Devin in our firm he's one of the one of the shareholders he he's he's part of our AI committee and he created a qaq cbot and he loved it I don't know why I'm not playing here and this is a presentation you gave us he's like basically here's the bot he's gonna feed it I'm gon to fastport here he's telling you this is how you create the bot right here on the left hand side is it's not very difficult to actually do I'm going to forward here I'm going to fast forward here because is basically what he's doing here is he's downloading the PDF set and this is a 35-page CD set planting plan um and he saying please help me check planting plan on this project check quantity and plant types which is exactly what it did he's showing the graph asked him to show show me the documents here that you're using for it and what did it actually look like and it gave him the results it gave him results it told them let's go here because we have to redo this process so it's going to give him the results of basically doing an audit of those documents um I'm not going to go into the specific details about this this is something we're doing internally still but it has a lot of pro promise to be rolled out to the entire firm uh again it checked so amendments uh labels and call outs uh you could and then we did another test with an 165 page full CD set for multiple consultants and it was able to check specifications it cannot write specs but we'll talk about that it found conflicts and collisions for example there was a label over an important drawing set add into an item there's a lot of information that it gave to us this is one of those topics that could deserve its own presentation going to leave enough with that but this is part of our R&D internally is being able to do this and that it is an efficient time-saving invisible simple process and talking about that you know for the generative models and again what he was doing with that construction documents say was generative Nvidia is offering its system we're still trying to get information about Nvidia edify but it's supposed to be able to allow you to create your own generative Bots is that correct Jen yeah so the way that I understand that it works is that Nvidia basically partnered up with gety images um to create a platform that companies or professionals can actually create their own generative Bots and train it on only specific information so the way that we're looking at it is we would create a generative image model that is only trained on our projects um on work from our company and so it kind of has it would mimic our style of you know how we design things oh topaz Labs topaz Labs has become part of my everyday I'm just going to show you what it does so topaz Labs video AI if you don't so I'm gonna play on this video this video is 720p at 25 frame rate you can see that it's blurry maybe a little jittery um what this particular tool does and this is again I I use these every day now they're no longer you know so basically I throw the final video into topaz Ai and it lets me upscale it from in this case 7 720p to 1440 or you know 2K and then instead of 30 frame rate or 25 frame rate to 60 frame rate normally this would take me hours or days to render out correctly on my own system this is not just a shortcut because it will also sharpen the image you can apply different filters and the result is this much more crisp photorealistic I'm going to set it here smoother animation this is now part of our daily process for the past year as we were doing this presentation my my subscription for this ran out I panicked and I told my boss I needed it now um this is something that's going to be standard for everybody because clients have bigger screens more resolution everything's getting sharper and you're going to have to upssize it quickly so that is gigapixel by that's um sorry that's video AI by topaz labs they have multiple tools the other one is gigapixel the other one I absolutely cannot live without this was a a hand sketch done by my friend Jim leet I had a very small version of it and gigapixel let me basically super siize it um up to 600 times larger which is immense like talking about the size of a building so I showed you this image before that I grabbed a snapshot from SketchUp diffusion I then ran it through gigapixel this is gigapixel showing me hey what do you up what do you want to upsize this to it's showing me the pixel density you can upscale basically six times just natively or you can put a custom option in but you could see what it did it actually is extraordinarily crisp in what it does in being able to cre create these images it also lets you do batch so I can render out an animation dump that entire as still images toss it into gigapixel and then upssize the resolution and the sharpness and the result was worth it I did it for a project that I'm under NDA that I cannot show but these tools are very legit so now we're going to go into passive AI so this is where you no longer need to essentially use your left brain to figure out what you're trying to do we'll talk about Luma AI here Jen if you want to jump into Luma yeah so Luma AI is actually a AI scanning app that you can get on your iPhone um it basically allows you to walk around an object and take three different Loops of it one at the top one in the middle and one at the bottom and then it uploads to their platform on your phone and then they actually generate a 3D model from that object for you um we've used this for sculpture Gardens um for historic sites for things that we wanted to preserve within our projects and so these are some of the 3D models that Luma created for us that then we were able to bring into SketchUp and manipulate if we needed to and then that top rendering is actually the final project with some of those statues in it here's another one I was contacted by a principal on a Monday and he said he needed to do a recorded interview with animation by Friday I've done multimedia work in the past it usually takes two three four weeks we did it in four days this included having to create the easy part was creating this animation that's uh the helicopter flying all that this was done in lumium the hard part was then actually creating a script narration recording and everything else that went into it I asked Chad I'm going to Chad again everything we're doing in the sperm requires all hands- on Deck so we're talking about different people in our firm helping us Chad I asked him give me an outline of what what this narr narration has to be from that point on I then took GPT for is like take what he did and make this into a narrated script what is this going to sound like or what is it going to read like so he gave me the outline Chachi PT gave me the script I then found another AI to tool I don't know what this one is called I'm going to hit play but basically took the script that Chach PT generated I needed to hear what it sounded like influence my experience spans from designing parks and Open Spaces to corporate campuses and urban frameworks. conf you get the idea it lets me choose voices but I was able to do flow and then edit the script again perfect I then gave that script to Chad told him to sit down with his iPhone and start recording about Confluence poor Chad he's a very private guy I'm sorry great guy too um so from that I got all these recordings and then I used Adobe podcast and this is if you have an adobe ATC you can get this this thing's amazing as well it's another this is basically an entire audio studio and clean up in one place we were then able to throw everything together and clean it up with Adobe audio of nine awardwinning offices Yeah clean audio 13 to tap into a diverse pool of experts across various Specialties we ended up winning the project but it was this combination of tools and AI tools from chat GPT to uh narration to audio cleanup to video merging that led us be able to do this and that's all passive again this is where it's invisible and here's another big one and we're going to talk about rendering because that's what we do every this is the rendering tools that we use within our office or have tried but in some ways you know we're very multilingual in terms of of rendering programs across nine offices one of the things that we wanted to test was what people's preferences were about rendering so we actually did a survey both internal external and we didn't tell people what program produced these renders just that it did and that it was you know no post-processing and what we discovered was everybody scored 2.5 in essence it was a statistical tie there was uh no winner here like on not just one render but two three four render like pretty much nobody out of preference which just talks about how subjective renderings really are when you hear that someone say hey that rendering looks really good why can't you do that yeah Point them to the survey so what does that mean so first and foremost we're going to talk about on real engine because you're seeing this pop online now it's not the only one but this Tool's amazing and they have Technologies now that they've rolled out the big thing about them is they can process an infinite amount of geometry and an infinite texture size which is right we're super sizing the textures now we have gpus that can basically run as much geometry as you want so I'm following the Video Game World and D5 render which I'll demo which I'll show you which we do use uses Unreal Engine which we love it I also demo Alpha test video games this one's called PX day and it's not the fact that they're just building these kind of amazingly beautiful sceneries they're building the tool sets to actually build them so you can the players build everything the buildings are built by the players they're giving you the tool sets the 3D automated tool sets to build all these things so the gaming industry is kind of merging with where we are so why D5 I love D5 uh this Tool's just beautiful from The Parallax to the night renders to the photo realism but again it's backed up by a jet an AI backbone where they have the ability to do AI generated textures that's a big deal because then they can make them seamless they're using AI atmosphere for the hdri to really make your renders pop with in terms of the atmosphere and the content that you're providing it to um it it can go in there and what like gigapixel upsize your textures using an AI algorithm probably the same one that gigapixel does just modified and then matching so again like everything that's going on with the rendering world is AI focused as well and you get these kind of really beautiful results in terms of what we've been able to get with D5 uh and and we have a Perpetual license for this tool and it's it's being used exclusively actually right now by Bennett Ridley in our Denver office he was actually able to do these renders in D5 the problem he got into is when he showed these to the clients they wanted him to match the planting plan exactly which I think is what he ended up doing but usually it's the other way around you do the planting plan and then you go and do the render in this case he did the render and but he's been using D5 as part of a continuous process over what he likes over uh how to use that this is the example of again D5 and then there's the other one we we tested a lot of render engines we also use ncape we have vray uh that we use in different offices but across the board our preference is Lumia 2024 this tool is amazing it's again like lumian when it first came out this is Jen did this render the Mandate I've given everybody in the firm is to please do evening night renders really make things pop and this thing really popped and again that's the AI capabilities behind the rate Trac that you know they have rate tracing here supports all the natural items glass bouncing off light lumian uh you're able to really do some amazing stuff with doing lighting now which is what I always wanted to do and if you look at the really good amazing rendering artists like Alex hogra uh they they're basically doing a lot of dusk night renders so we're finally able to emulate these kind of what these Masters and Pros have done on a more seamless level for ourselves to get to these renders again we're doing Lots and lots and lots of these kindon reders and tests at night what you're seeing in here is also another thing I didn't include in this presentation but parallx which are these Holograms of interiors that you place within models one of them is roombox by SketchUp and also lumian and D5 have these interiors that you can light up and then place in these buildings and make them look photo realistic again these are more examples of it here's another rendering we're going to talk about this bridge next this is a bridge I did with Patrick at alod in in the designer at Confluence and it was all about lighting and we'll talk about lighting again because lighting is the big theme here being able to do that and how that all works but we're going to talk about drones here I'm going to jump in this is sou Falls South Dakota and why drones drones are also the original AI they've been drones are based off AI everything about a drone is AI driven we have a pretty substantial drone practice at Confluence uh Jen if you want to talk about these because this is your project here yeah so the first week I think that I worked at Confluence I flew to sou Falls to do 3D scans for all of Falls Park which was huge it took us a whole week um of flying and then another you know three to six months to process all the data to actually create a 3D model from that but this is just kind of showing you a proposed um Overlook that they were going to add to the park and some outflow structures um to keep the river at a certain height and just kind of showing you the you know the importance of drones and how we can use them in our workflows to create these really hyper realistic photo matches and our our firm again like we used just videos we take lots of photos become ubiquitous I think this one's funny um Jen because of the fact that I we put this photo in I was like my God that looks like mid Journey right um yeah so we actually fly to different offices when we have new drone pilots and do Hands-On training with them so that um they kind of get to see the process and how it works and you know what kind of images we can really get with a drone I think these are mostly from our Chicago office de Mo and Minneapolis so why drones again like you can get this high resolution aial out of this to the point where you can see all the way down to the ground and you can see l then written on the bottom left this becomes part of our process in terms of Graphics as well where we can do these really amazing photo matches uh again using drones 3D modeling you know the Drone to to manage our drone Studio it's all AI backbones so here right this is air data that was set up and we can track the drones the batteries the flights the pilots across nine offices there are crashes you can track the crashes sometimes you have to ask the pilot for the log but at the same time you could see that everything here this is this is kind of your own air traffic control system and flight log system that's one stop one shop and again a everything is AI driven you know you can we flew false Park we're able to drive this drone data from it what does that mean so what you're looking at here is images of Point cloud data derived from a drone flight you know was a little crazy how to capture this at the time and you're seeing how the this is the Drone flight and what the Drone captures as a snapshot or image that's then assembled into the whole thing so drones become drones are really a big part of what we do as well and that's not going to stop the track they're on is clearly if you follow the news and what's going on with some conflicts that drones are here to stay and only going to get smarter and we're not even touching the surface another AI study another SketchUp tool to scan Essentials so this is works you can take Point cloud data and import it into SketchUp using this tool and then view it and then on top of it you can create a Terrain model out of it real quickly I'll show you in a video here how that works hopefully this is quick but basically I'm going in using scan Essentials I'm locating the point cloud data for this particular project and then I can just it's going to ask me to create so there's the point cloud data it's a million Kil it's a million k and then I'm going to create a reference file RW rwp file sorry the data set was a gig a million bytes and then it's going to import that information in this might take a couple of minutes I think I pause the video here just let it finish and then when it's done you always have to remember to hit Zoom extend was being stubborn about letting me hit zoom extents and then it's going to show you the point cloud data and then you can manipulate how that point cloud data is viewed you have different settings on scan Essentials this is amazing tool again another SketchUp tool a lot of people don't know about that's extraordinarily powerful for the type of work that you can you could do but even the best part because at this point we ask people for their point cloud data please give us your point cloud data so we can create the terrain model in SketchUp and it's there's lots of different tools here I'm not going into the details again this tool can use its own half hour presentation on how it works but I'll just show you that it did create the train for me right there I turn it off I'm going to create some pseudo Contours for here in a second I believe just to show you what that looks like but again very powerful in terms of what these tools can do Fast Forward here see I use another extension to create Contours I'll turn that off and then you can see the Contour file so I talked about placemaker and being able to import in all this geodata and geodata is a really big part of the AI world right because facial recognition software which was really Pioneer early the 2000s then is being used at all sorts of places and what people are doing it is applying it to Aerials high resolution are so companies like ecopia and near map which we have relationships with in terms of placemaker can now go on the right hand side you can see this information they can quantify through an aerial all the information on the ground plane to start giving you data sets like placemaker so what does this mean if you can get pavement parking Road all these all the different aspects that make up these points well the future is is you're going to be able to build oneclick derived 3D existing models of locations that's not fiction that's coming pretty quickly uh on the horizon and that's going to change a lot of stuff in terms of what kind of data you start with so for example this might be on demand here's a uh an aerial a drone derived aerial an aerial that was tossed into this uh not facial recognition but aerial recognition software it then created a cad drawing with layers and very clean orthagonal Line work for that process what and here you could see I think this I just need to go to the next slide to show that information and that's actually better than what you're going to get from a surveyor uh no offense to the surveyors it's just this is the where the future is going and then you know a company like ecopia you can contact them right now and they'll you give them six weeks and $2,000 and they'll give you 2 kilometers worth of this data that's accurate down to the driveways down to the paths again this is something that's I talk about year and year out and it's a slow moving thing I've been talking about this particular data sets for the past seven years and it's only going to become more ubiquitous so we're going to talk about go on to the next part here which you know beyond AI is parametric so where right you saw all this generative models and they lack precision and where again where you have pre Precision is really again like something like urb paint which I'm just plugging again here real quick which automates to creation of streetscapes one of my favorites by Chuck Valley is the SketchUp extensions instant architecture which again is part of our daily reality and these are parametric tools and it's a matter of time before they merge shake hands with AI and God knows what that's going to look like you know a tool like plus speec is another example and then I'm going to talk about lightup because I fell in love with this tool in terms of parametrics so this is a bridge we were working on in suit Falls called in Cedar Rapids called Cedar Rapids connect and we started doing all these renderings and especially at night then we got these renderings from the lighting designer and the poor lighting designer did not have any budget and they were using 3ds Max and they were using IES profiles to create these renders well we took lumian and we took ncape and we took the programs D5 and they allow you to put in IES profiles we could not match what was being completed by the lighting designer and we were being tasked with designing the lighting for this bridge well that's a liability because this is not my lumian render once this lighting goes in it's not going to look like what they did here and this became problematic the more we went through it so we started researching different types of software that we can use and what we discovered is that well 3D s Max was originally designed as a lighting program hence it could accurately display IES profiles lumian D5 and all the in all the chaos group stuff no offense to all these people unfortunately for them you can't accurately emulate IES profiles you can't do no matter the sub scattering surfaces doesn't matter not going to be accurate so we started being panicking and started looking into professional lighting software and I finally went to the SketchUp uh uh forms and lo and behold got introduced to light up and this tool is ridiculously amazing and and especially because it's letting me do lighting so what does it do let you do there's not a lot of places first and foremost there's not a lot of places where you can do lighting design like this you can either do it with these professional programs like agi32 and diux or you can do it with 3ds Max which is an investment on itself but to do it in SketchUp well that's great so you can put the light source in like the professional softwares it's showing you the profile it's showing you the profile and where it's going to show its light and then you can render it so this was the 3ds Max render now the the coloring and the Ambiance don't match between these renders but the lighting output does because this is rendered inside SketchUp so it's rendering it it's creating the lightup model we did a whole bunch of studies like this so how do we light the cables do we light the outside of the pillar we did probably uh 30 40 renders we spent a and we made money off of this because 150% on the investment into lightup itself we actually even did lighting studies for the interior and this was all possible because of lightup we wouldn't have been able to outdo it now we know that we can do this we're actually offering lighting Services as part of what we're doing lightup gives you all these other outputs and these are called Lux this is the Lux contour map to show you where the light is or is not hitting you know these are professional diagrammatic lighting diagrams that you can then we are able to produce all this including the send the model as an fbx export to the lighting designers to confirm if we did it they L that because they had no budget we had to end up doing that work and the end result was being able to actually use this tool so again going back this is all about parametrics don't forget about parametrics don't forget about parametrics they're powerful like there's Rhino all these other tools I'm going to talk about that in a second as well but the parametric aspect is where we've all been for the past 15 years it's don't throw the baby out with the bath water it's really combining the parametrics with AI because then you're telling AI how to be precise so hopefully we'll see more of that I know some companies like land effects and that are doing that other AI so mentioning rhino rhino and grasshopper it's not an easy tool won't lie but there's parametrics in there that work within Rhino or and there's AI for construction documents that you can figure it out with Rhino to give SketchUp Kudos here there's a lot of other stuff I haven't mentioned that SketchUp is doing that's also Aid driven but then there's other things like there's these tools for uh managing your calendar I was working with somebody so let's meet tomorrow at a certain time I was going to go uh schedule it he used AI it was already there it was kind of creepy uh we're talking about looking at specs so Deltech apparently purchased Master spec I don't know if that's true or not but it seems they have a Rel relationship and they're applying AI to spec and spec writing Autodesk love them or hate them they are always at the Forefront and have been at the Forefront of generative work for a very long time and now they really have some interesting tools for generative floor plans what's interesting is the way they do the generative floor planning for bu buildings is they're using planning terms like region street plaza so this is going to apply in a broader set near map is amazing uh we use them all the time I have a relationship with them they're all my projects start with near map with placemaker in your map it's because it's high resolution arals and all this data driven designed information this is up and coming Silo Geo met them recently and they are going to provide Geo dat that we can all use and need so that was a lot of information we actually did it an hour and six minutes which is kind of impressive um thought it would go longer but again there's a lot here to go over so just leave it with the notion that AI is real a lot of these tools probably don't work they might it depends on their investment and it's really finding workflows and becoming the expert in doing it I know that it's taking a group of us within our company to do it this is not one person this is several and the process in itself is daunting sometimes but we're finding the case uses so for example something like uh Runway you know where we're investing our money is in tools like Runway and the and rendering and the D5 renders but it's finding all these tools are there broader bigger pictures that are going to happen with AI absolutely um but keep it seamless so thank you very much thank you Jen any last words I don't think so I think you covered it all right thank you very much [Music]
