hello this is Jim Lamers with Trinity animation I'm here today at Dimensions 3D base camp to talk about SketchUp for event design I'm going to show you how we use SketchUp in a particular project this one was for the Kansas City Chief's home stadium called Arrowhead a 50-year-old Stadium at least it was at the time we did the work uh that had a lot of challenges and complex and interesting details which I'll be showing you today um a little bit about me first uh I'm uh the founder of a 3D animation studio in Kansas City so um I've uh worked in a lot of different kinds of animation production and in addition I have written some books on 3D and I've also taught a lot of classes on 3D um here's a little look at some of the the work that we've created over the years so a little animation background um couple of major Show Business things we were part of Starship Troopers a big film in the 90s that we did five or six visual effects on and also you'll see segments in here from a TV show called Archer Archer is on the FX channel we did 14 Seasons well of the 14 we did 10 seasons of the backgrounds and so uh all the environment ments you see on that show are 3D and 3D rendered you'll see a lot of other kinds of projects we've done including medical architectural demonstrative and uh just all manner of uh realistic and cartoonish 3D a lot of our work in the past has been more in the realm of architecture and also furniture and products like that but but with uh some of the tools coming out making those tasks easier for people to handle in house we're finding more and more we're doing complex 3D animations uh like this fetal development animation for example all right well um let me um I'll pause this and uh you can see the covers of a couple of the books I worked on and we'll talk a little bit about Arrowhead so um I wanted to tell you a little bit about the client needs and uh the the the situation there it's sort of interesting so the people who work at Arrowhead they've got 16 spaces that they have to keep booked up with all manner of concerts and um corporate events and weddings and similar sorts of things so these are some of the names for those different environments they can do them all at the same time it's a really big Stadium it's got some big areas around it and um here we let let me give you a little look at what the sadium looks like in case uh you're uh unfamiliar so here's a little look at the exterior of it it's they've got a baseball and a football stadium side by side and when the stadium was originally built it was just kind of a flat Bowl but the area in question a lot of it is on this side of it you see the upper Penthouse and Press Box areas and then the areas down below here so they have branding from ghaw field also but people in Kansas City are really in the zone of calling it Arrowhead and a little bit more aerial footage and here we can see um how it looks just looking straight down in the bowl and on the opposite side here you can see where a lot of the event spaces are so those faes include the large ballrooms the Tower Club East and Tower Club West and also fun places like the locker room club and the club four which are just kind of more like bars uh just big kind of brightly lit bars and then actual places where things happen like the actual Chief's locker room is a space as well as the field things can happen on on the field they um they try to protect their grass but they will have events that end up with people standing out right in the middle of the football field here's kind of a look at some of the spaces and here's what they look like for corporate presentation or a party room with you know that's kind of a bar this is kind of more of a wedding reception dinner in one of those large ballrooms I was talking about so the event challenge as you could imagine is they've got to give people an idea of how these are going to be laid out and what sort of events are happening anyone in event planning I'm sure has some understanding of how you deal with client needs and showing them what you're going to do for them so here we have rounds of eight we have a stage with a Podium you know we've got a big screen and you give people a real idea of how it's going to look even in perspective you can view it from any seed in the house and see how it's going to feel so they really like that because up till now what they've been using are 2D CAD drawings like what you see here so they uh person just has to have some ability to visualize uh that they're talking to to get a sense of where those tables are going to appear uh there was a couple of other drawbacks as I mentioned here the cad files were a little inaccurate um they had changed things uh many times with improvements and additions and they're always adding or fixing up something in the stadium and as I mentioned the prospects can't really figure out how it's going to look and um also you can't really tell if there's some bad viewing positions especially for people seated obviously if they're right up against the column you can kind of tell uh like here you could see this table the guy sitting on this side he can't really see the stage but um you know otherwise uh it's there's other uh things to keep in mind there these um red boxes they put in try to sometimes ask us to help figure out how to keep things away from the columns so so at first we uh were just a SketchUp dealer to Arrowhead events and they got a bunch of copies of SketchUp they started working with it and they asked for a class where they might learn the methods of SketchUp so we happen to have a classroom at our company and they came in and we did a classroom and we started talking about the modeling and it's a pretty challenging 3D modeling task somebody needs to get fairly good at SketchUp to do rooms and corridors that are all on a gradual curve because everything's in a bowl shape in this building it's a lot harder than simple 2D Cad and you'll also notice even the windows here are slanted outward so it becomes a real modeling challenge so after some discussion they decided that Trinity would step in and go measure and photograph and build all the texture maps and create all the 3D geometry and package the whole thing up so that they had a turnkey world for each of those spaces and on top of that we were going to make the Entourage that is the chairs the lect turns everything that they use from their own inventory to prop out an event so that the SketchUp uh user working at Arrowhead events could just drag and drop rounds of eight or chairs or lect turns or whatever they needed to set up a an event so we wanted to give the feel of being in a space but we knew that a lot of their people that were going to use this might not have very fast computers they might be an older laptop and they're just going out in the field and showing it off so we can't assume they're going to have some Super 3D video card or powerful processor and we wanted to make the component Library something where all the furniture you can see in the screen capture here on the right I've just clicked on Tower set two and just dragged into the scene and I've got that prop ready to go in this this is what the locker room looks like and each player has his name and a helmet on uh each of the different uh lockers there so uh I think it's kind of interesting to learn a little bit about this stadium and I hope you've got some interest in football and architecture and that sort of thing I'm going to just give you a a real brief uh story about the construction of Arrowhead so they decided in around the late 60s early 70s that they would build this uh double Stadium both the Royals and the Chiefs are side by side the chief stadium is the fourth largest at 7646 and it's 52 years old now in 2024 it was first used in 72 so it's the third oldest NFL stadium in use Soldier Field and uh Lambo field I believe are the two uh that are the oldest here you can see where they're digging it out and uh putting it together in the um early part of 1971 if we could get CAD files for all this stuff it would be tsquare triangle type stuff so this is sort of the father of football in Kansas City Lamar Hunt and he had a big impact on football and I think it's interesting even for someone who isn't that interested in sports he was an oil man uh from the uh Texas area and um got interested in football and started with a football team in Texas and and he couldn't get into the NFL it was a pretty closed system then so he started his own League called the AFL and with some of his friends and um colleagues he would he I think they got eight teams together and called it the AFL so after that i' had been going a few years uh they came up with the idea what if we had a bowl like they have the Rose Bowl and the Cotton Bowl and these other college bowl games maybe the AFL could play against the NFL in a bowl and there's a really funny letter you'll find where Lamar huntt said um I've got this idea for a a combo thing and I have a really stupid idea for it the Super Bowl I'm sure we can come up with something a lot better than that but um let's uh you know let's see what we can think of and um sure enough they thought that was a silly idea he said he got the idea from his daughters playing with super B balls those rubbery balls that you can bounce around and and so when they finally had the game they just called it like the AFL NFL battle or maybe the merger Bowl but U real quickly all the newspapers and everybody started calling it the Super Bowl after they heard about Lamar pitching that as the first idea for it so within about three years what was the merger bowl or the AFL NFL fight was had become the Super Bowl and everybody loved that name so it just took off and very quickly became the name the Kansas City Star local newspaper had a big part in that you can see when it was first built you don't see any of that superstructure on the side it's just it's just a big uh stadium seating bowl with these uh large overhangs so here it is after one of the the big renovation you can see by 2013 they had switched these over to be Jumbotron TVs and um done a major renovation that includes a lot of the spaces I'm going to show you here shortly but on this Lower Side here you can see the the big super structure that includes the space where a lot of the spaces are so and here's what it looks like on a game day you can see video screens that belt all the way around the sides and you can see the um the big jumbotrons on the ends so the the task at hand for us then was to go uh look at these places and um build them so let me give you I we took some videos when we were working on it I'm going to show you a few of those so you can get a sense of what it felt like to walk around so this is called the Hall of Honor this is one of the spaces um we're starting um outside of it let me scooch along a little bit here here we go so now we're in the Hall of Honor these are uh shot not so much to get a sense of them but we we shot these as a way to come back and in case we had missed a photo that we thought we might need let me step ahead a little bit here and show you what it looks like just kind of walking through it so the Hall of honor is really kind of a trophy room it's full of artifacts and history and um memories it's a place where they can also have events and there's some big TV screens to play things on let me Jump Ahead a little further here so this is one of the spaces we had to do we knew this one was going to be a little more challenging because you can see there's just so much complexity in there moving to the next one this is the uh locker room Club so in this space we've got sort of a bar-like atmosphere let me Jump Ahead here a little bit and it's a fun little nightclub but you can see there's a lot to build there's complex ceilings complex floors light fixtures up above and we need to make this all accurate and uh loading and playing smoothly on a laptop an old laptop okay let me show you a little bit of the north Club this is this is another of the uh clubs this one's a little more like a um allall room here we can see a very high ceiling it's about 30 35 ft and uh a large walkup bar and then a huge Ballroom so these are for corporate events or weddings or things like that usually they have a lot of Art and sculptures throughout and they needed those represented in here as well so we had to capture all of the flat art and at least in a simple way kind of sculpt the uh the 3D art that they had and you kind of get a little taste of the fact that this is 50 some years old by some of the things that remain um for example the electronics on the walls a lot of them are just right out of the 70s so it's a large event space so to to put that together first we had to quote it and get their approval for it and uh that was a a complex task with a lot of estimation as you might imagine but we figured there would be some days of survey and then some days of uh of 3D modeling and then building the Entourage so we we went in equipped with a a camera a tablet just a regular measuring tape and a laser measure the laser measures are like $35 on Amazon pretty easy to find and that allows you to measure things like 35 foot high ceilings and especially when they go up and down you can get the dimensions and the depths and that sort of thing obviously the measuring tape for anything that is smaller the um the camera let us capture things that we might later need to turn into textures but surprisingly helpful was the tablet the tablet would allow us to take a photo and Mark it up like you see here so that we could really rapidly go around and get measurements and distances and not have to do a simultaneous drafting job alongside uh capturing it so um you might say well you could have just gone with a lar you put the lar in these positions you have it shoot a segment yeah we consider that we don't have a lot of experience with lar so we'd have to learn how to use it but the biggest thing with that is we need a low poly uh accurate model and Lars usually give you millions and millions of colored uh points in a point cloud and then it's your job to go model over the top of that so it would have saved us some of the measuring but I think it would have made other tasks a bit more complex so we just chose to go with the old school method you see here um there were some CAD files that they the ones that they were using for laying these out but uh we thought we'd better check everything and sure enough there were things that were off significantly so we went in and we measured at all here you can see me uh sitting down and measuring something and you can see where we've got dimensions for each of these uh where the heights are varying here's a typical annotated picture you can use a little capacitive pen on a tablet this tablet was just an inexpensive Galaxy tablet you can get them for a couple hundred dollars and uh they're great more uh measurements and uh here's me going around and photographing each of the museum items we would be uh making texture planes for all of the items that are floating in the displays there so this is uh some shots from What's called the Hall of Honor which I gave you a look at before so we've got sculptures on the left here we've got all sorts of U memor IA and we have the the bridge with the Chiefs logo on it this we would have to 3D model um and then those movies I showed you I call this mopping up with a movie so we spent about three days capturing all this stuff but we learned it was really helpful to come back with some movies where we just to put the camera everywhere and then when we were in the middle of 3D modeling if something came up where we were trying to remember if a say a window mulon was hidden by a column or the ceiling changed in a certain place usually the movies were there to give us the answer it's very helpful so just like a uh 5 to 10 minute walk around depending on how big the room was and just trying to capture every square inch few more of our um um shots of measuring and then we also needed to capture everything that would be uh interesting that is um a tech texture so we had carpet ceilings walls we had woods and metals and stones and just all manner of textures to capture so everything was captured and then um often we had to create an opacity mask which I'll talk about more in the next section but here's kind of what the image looks like where we've got each of the individual shots and then here they are composited into a u a block here's what they look like when you're standing in front of them so they would not have like a a perspective shift when you walk around them if they're going to be flat but it still works pretty well um and meets the um here you can see how it looks in SketchUp it pretty well meets the needs of the presenter who's doing the event sales so here we've got the bit Maps derived from photography and applied to the display boxes and that's what the SketchUp scene looked like when it was put together this area is kind of fun this was called the foolish Club so these are the guys that had those AFC football teams and they were considered foolish cuz the NFL was just so entrenched to start up a whole new football club so they kind of took pride in that and they call themselves The foolish club and here you can see we've got a big decal on the floor a big photo portrait of them TV screens on the walls and then some text on some glossy panels on the sides so we're trying to capture all this art there's also a bunch down in this panel here and we want to get it with as few shadows and from with as little perspective as we can because that's how you get your photographs for your decals you can unshift them a little in Photoshop you just don't want to be too big of a job but here's what we're able to do take a photograph from above of this floor decal and turn it into this bit map and then this is what's inside the display cabinet and then this is our attempt to do the back wall you can see some Reflections it's just really hard to get rid of everything but um since SketchUp doesn't do Reflections it might actually look okay so we'll see what we think uh here is the finished SketchUp scene when you're walking around it so there's the photo of the actual space and then here it is in SketchUp so we're getting a pretty good approximation of how the thing looks here's the side view where you can see the decals and of course this is quite glossy here here's the decal we were ble to go through and use tools to get rid of all those Reflections and these are those AFL teams we mentioned those are the original uh 10 with her names and uh here we go where we've got the actual SketchUp scene so that gives you a sense of the of the time that we spent out there yeah there was a lot of security and badges and things but once we got past the gate they pretty much just let us have a four solid hours of going wherever we needed to go and nobody seemed to bother us much which was nice all right next up is now we have to go make the thing we had budgeted about uh 50 60 hours maybe of site photography and prep work and then at least four five 600 hours of modeling to build everything for all these scenes so we got their CAD files in and it was a good starting point once we kind of chopped away all the areas we didn't want um you can see that there's a bll shape in this stadium and everything is built on a curve and that's where I was later thinking to myself yeah it's probably not really a first project for a SketchUp user there's a little little much to do so um we uh we learned when we looked at it closely was it it's not on a pure curve but about every when you're close into the bowl it moves more quickly and when you're out here it's slower but generally about every 10 or 15 ft it would shift like 2° so it's it's really like um well kind of like a an oval that you would make in SketchUp with a a limited number of polygons going around so you'll find that it's they're straightaways but not for very far and and then it bends again this makes it really complex because when you're trying to do things like uh clone out all these columns down here um there's there's no simple way to just copy and um make an array of 20 of these you got to move each one of these columns and then rotate it into place or just build it from the ground up uh with its um circumference and then extrude that here you can see the uh the distance it's about 3 Dees in this case uh from this Edge to the next Edge over of course when you get farther out from the they go longer distances so here is the simplified CAD once we brought it in and started to work with things they had the grids for the ceilings in there and then you can see uh the walls and there's like a bar over here that was a fairly recent addition they had built this bar out in 3D but everything else was flat in 2D so once we've gone in and made some usable shapes we can do push pulls to kind get some beginning of uh orientation and start to build it this is a great place to start where you know you've got the the the long uh boundaries of it in place and you can start to create and have something to build around so going from just simple push pulls to this as you can imagine at this point we have to go in and uh start placing the art start applying some colors and even uh it's got a kind of a repeating pattern it's pretty obvious from up high here but we've got a sample of the carpet that we've applied we've built some of the the art which is just shapes that have Push pulls on them and then little rectangular panels on the describing the AR we wanted to get all the signage in that they had and uh a little more complex is this uh window grid because it tilts outward so it's uh curving um along the bottom and then it's tilted outward as well so it's a little more complex than usual in SketchUp again a little bit challenging so here I think I'll show you a little bit of SketchUp itself so uh here you can see um this is the Hall of honor and we can go around and see what we've got built there you can see here's the foolish club and everything's in a one to one scale here you can see the reflection that's a little bit baked into that back wall and from the right angle it looks kind of more believable than maybe when you're way out but it's a complex scene that will play in a um in a lower quality laptop okay let's go back and look at kind of sort of the beginnings of building the um the model so this is an early uh scene from when we were just getting started and it gives you a little bit of a idea of how it's coming along so I've put in some of the letters and some of the little cuts that you see there started to apply some materials and get it together let's go up to a top view and take a look at what we have when we just look at the um the lines that are there so I'm going to just hide a little bit of this and here we can see how this appears when we're working this way and you can kind of see where the angles break along the um the walls here I think it's an easy place to see it so uh uh We've started to do a little bit of the picture work and um here's a few tips in in SketchUp that will possibly help if you are dealing with a project like this I wanted to show you there's an option in SketchUp where you can create the local axes it may not have come up before but it's pretty handy on something like this bowl project so if you built a like a square and you put it in this corner here and then you just try to move it along obviously let's go down a little bit to like here and then just draw it out you can see it doesn't really line up with anything there nor does it really line up with anything there going delete those come back here and this time we'll go ahead and build an axis that lets us align along that wall so if we're going to copy something or build something it'll already be pre-aligned so that option is up here under Tools axes and it's just looking as you can see for red green and blue so XYZ we we can come along the um oops let me get back to where I was there there we go going to be careful about zooming out when I'm in a perspective view but uh here we can orbit around so that we can snap this to the other end of it right there so so now that's our x axis next we have the green axis for for y and then Z so now when I go in and draw something you'll see that it's lined up to the wall and if we want to copy something like this then when I U Move it it's also going to move along the edge of the wall so if I snap if I duplicate it and then create some more out here and then uh we could say uh X3 and um everything's in line at least till we get to the next break point so using these local axes can save time when you're trying to say put cut lines in this wall or otherwise uh copy Out Entourage that's going to appear there all right uh getting back let me see here here we go uh the next one is uh layers uh these uh we started by loading this CAD file up and as you can see you get an awful lot of tags and these convert from the layers in a professional CAD scene so um you might find what you need to do is come in and select things and then move them to another U tag and then um delete and pair down the number of tags you have so if we select this one select all what excuse me select this one and uh select all that are tagged with that then I could go in and take these items and you know move them to another um tag right here once a tag is empty you can just go in and delete it so there's a little process of cleaning up and pairing it down and making it usable for what you're trying to do okay next up is um tilable textures so if you're going to make woods and stones and carpets you don't want to have something that's 100 feet long for a carpet you need to make one small Swatch that then repeats and it needs to repeat without seams so that's what we mean when we say tilable it may have uh come up to you before um if you've done much 3D with textures there are a mix of tilable and non- tilable textur that are part of the SketchUp library at least going back to older versions some of them some of them when they repeated they'd have a real obvious seam where a texture stopped and restarted like a wood grain where there's a cut point where it changes so how do you make tilable textures uh I'm going to take a moment out and give you a little look at how that process is done so you try to take your photographs on the ground and you try to take them in a way that you're mostly looking straight down without perspective unlike this shot and that the lighting is not really creating Shadows or hotpots anywhere but if you didn't do that and you don't have a great source image you can still work off of this so you can see that we're trying to take a rectangular polygon here that's in perspective that that uh captures a good representative sample it's good to kind of know how many feet and inches you're capturing too because later you'll scale the texture to about that size so in this case you can see we've sort of looked at what appears to be over here the um perspective lines the vanishing point and draw this rectangle out once we've got that we can go copy and paste that into a new image and now we need to unsew it so there's a tool in Photoshop called um transform and if you hold down the control key on a Windows machine you can just move the end points of that and um get it into shape I think on a Mac it's the command key so you can see here I just keep moving them iteratively until I've got it mostly in a rectangular shape and then I just crop it and I've got my a starting texture here so once I have that the next step is to do what's called an offset that's where we move all the seams into the middle so you can go to this uh tool called offset I'll show you right here where it comes from so filter other and then offset and then we can go in and put any number of pixels left or right and you can see the seams all come inward as we do that and then the key here is to have the wraparound uh option set so anything that goes off the bottom comes back in on the top so this brings your seams in and now your edges are guaranteed seamless and all you have to do is fix the seams you've brought into the middle of the thing so that's usually pretty fast work once you've got seems mostly in the middle there's a variety of ways and techniques you can use for this and some of the AI tools are just terrific at fixing these things now but the traditional manner is kind of what I'm doing here where they used to use clone stamping now I'm using the brush healing tool which just samples from what's around it you can see I'm going in and making the um brush have a soft Edge so that when I apply this healing brush tool it doesn't um leave hard edges so it's a little more believable and with just a few brush Strokes I've got all of the seams you can see there's a vertical seam here and then the horizontal seam right across the middle it kind of worked out where it doesn't really have a strong seam on the right half but everything else we just need a quick few paint brush strokes and this should be tilable now if this this piece is probably something like I don't know 5 feet by 2 and 1/2 ft which is a good size as you get to smaller chunks sometimes if there's a a bright a particularly bright or a particularly dark spot they'll call that a birth mark and what happens is when it's grided out the human eye picks up that repeating grid really readily so you often have to kind of um sort of dull it out so that it doesn't look so uh strong so the pattern doesn't isn't so so prominent or choose to sample a larger piece of carpet so that you have a 10 foot by 20 foot swatch for example and you'll get better results they don't need necessarily need to be really high res which takes up a lot of memory and possibly again is a burden on that old laptop that that may be getting used so in addition to these tilable textures we have decals and emblems and Graphics that things that appear on glass for example or that they're just stuck on a wall so with these we want to create um sort of emblems um and the the key to this is that SketchUp will respect a transparency Channel if you use a file format called PNG so here you can see we've put a boundary in and just cut it out the little checkerboard means there's no background there we save this off as a PNG and we've got ourselves a decal so here is the before and after of this shot from the Hall of honor and you get a sense of how it came out another interesting area we had to build was the field so we even used satellite images and other pieces to put this together here we are out measuring it here I am puzzling over a bench you can see the dimensions on that and um you can see the field as it has come together here it's not overly detailed it's uh it it just needs to represent fairly well so the chairs are mostly done with um texture Maps here's an aerial photo for reference all right if anybody has questions I'm happy to answer some of those and um next I'm going to show you a little more about the uh Entourage which is mostly Furniture so the idea here is to have the furniture all in there and usable in the component Library here again we had to take a lot of references we're going to need a lot of textures and we're going to need to sculpt this so you can see the different pieces of it coming together here's a room that at the time had a lot of the furniture sitting out so we could go put it together and uh here you can see uh the furniture put in place so uh I guess what I should show you is a little flyth through of what we came up with so here's a movie that lets you take a look I can take questions while we tour around but this is just using the walk and free free flow from SketchUp and the Entourage looks like this I took a minute to use it right here so we go to the component library and all we had to do is point it at the folder where all the entourages located and it's a pretty straightforward manner of dragging and dropping the pieces that we've built here's furniture sets where we've made combinations so this makes it super easy for the event space coordinators to put this together in the end we got a great result the event coordinators were thrilled with the results and they've been able to use this ever since to demonstrate to people what they're going to get how things are going to look and adjust it before the day of the event and then they can even use it for the setup crew to put things in place here you'll notice on this scene there's little red boxes around the columns those are considered nogo zones so that helps them also keep things away from columns the right distance and that was a another little Adder that came up in the production of this project the Chiefs have been doing amazingly well the last 5 years my whole entire childhood they had struggled so their first Super Bowl that they won was in 1970 and that was um before my time so when I was growing up in Kansas City they were really one of those you know middle or down the the list kind of teams the whole entire time and uh it was uh pretty remarkable about six years ago when the Chiefs started to really become a very competitive team and it was funny to watch them go through the process of at first being sort of underdogs to winning pretty well and then now where some people almost seem to dislike them the way they used to dislike the Patriots it's like ah they've won it too much I hate them so that's been a we always think of these guys as As Nice Guys and our friends and and then we hear the people in Philadelphia really don't like him one bit it's a lot of fun so I've uh brought with me a uh prize I'm going to give out and I'm going to ask a a trivia question from my presentation and if you have the answer to that you will win a Chief's Super Bowl hat and with that I think I'm going to conclude my presentation that's at about 42 minutes and um I might go a little longer than this and hopefully take some questions in the middle and um otherwise uh we'll we'll wrap the presentation up around here I have this video set up so it can continue on for a while and look around and show the different scenes and I don't have to use my uh distract myself with it but thank you all for coming it's just been an honor to be a part of Trimble Dimensions this year and I hope you learned some interesting things about event planning and event setup even if you're not working with a football stadium I think a lot of these principles come into play Trinity recently got a new project that was similar to this and it's for a small uh Convention Center so we went back out and measured it and started building it oh interesting uh side point here also these paintings are by a friend of mine named Charlie podra he does a really interesting stylized cartoony sort of Art and the Chiefs are big fans of his also so it's great to see his art out there and there's even a plaque on the side here as a uh kind of um Legend to show you who's in the in the paintings lot of fun all right thank you [Music]
