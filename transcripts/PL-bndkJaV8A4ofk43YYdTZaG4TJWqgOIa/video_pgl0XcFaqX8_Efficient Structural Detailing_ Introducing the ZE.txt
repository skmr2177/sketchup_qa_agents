[Music] we lucky enough to get to present here um my name's David Zachary this is Jesse Brown uh we are Zachary engineering uh we're Engineers that operate from Iowa to Hawaii and we're able to do it all out one central office in Taho um we've been doing business for 30 years and we're boting the high uh in residential Market I work with mits owners a lot of faces in here work with butter um I'm excited to introduce Jesse to discussed today's uh topic which is how he how we run through details how we take a model and turn it into hundreds of details and uh it's going to happen fast don't expect keep up we will post this on our website and also at SketchUp um you go that Jesse bur AKA oh here we go that was last Bas scale yeah so today's topic we're going to look at efficiency SC called detailing um kind of look at what it takes in sketch up what it takes to layout uh kind of move forward from there there's a few things I want to get to at the end if we have some time but just you know an hour is not a lot of time of Q&A and the end uh just beforehand where do we have as far as who has done some detailing sketch up ofo okay vast majority that's pretty good um who's like under a year in SketchUp okay you're all by yourself we so World pretty pretty uh fluent in what we're doing so do ask your questions as they pop up this could be easier to answer that way oh Dave's going to interject it's sry how many Architects you uh Engineers all right we got a few um that was a okay cect interation So today we're going to we're going to talk about um layout detailing goals we came up uh we'll explain why we wanted to change the way we did it uh briefly the extensions just a couple extensions where we of detailing that we use um that are really helpful you'll see why we'll get into it do an example uh then we're going to move into the Z detail Library which is kind of our big uh big internal product we use to generate our detail sheets very very fast uh we're going to go a little bit further and actually look at editing and creating new details dets from within the library which is a good trick for anyone that does details that are pretty close to each other uh and then at the end we're just going to very quickly build a full detail sheet using the detail Library so you can see what's possible how fast that can happen I didn't put it in here but if we have some time at the end I was going to some the new stuff we're doing is linking Excel into layout which is kind of cool and I'll showcase that one bit if we have a little bit extra kind okay so we got a lot of people done some detailing just what we Happ here who's had issues detailing with L yeah okay throw some of them out what are those issues anyone we're upgraded an autograp that's okay that'll do it what what else no one and all work so perfectly go you raised your hand I you just raised your hand okay I will be you spy your best this so long okay who's had licking problems and that model is disappearing on them and then you get the big you know exclamation point of death on the screen you add that no okay few of us all right so some of the goals we came up with when we set up on this kind of Mission to uh become more efficient with our detailing is minimize the time required to find details that have already been drawn so whether you're working in a team on a server or a remote desktop kind of situation how do you find the details you've been drawn a lot of times it come comes down to Windows Explorer and hunt the pedal which is massively inefficient who's done that anyone it's okay it's okay we do that right okay uh how do you minimize the number of models that are shown in a detail sheet so if we say a standard 24x 36 sheet we probably have anywhere from 9 to 15 detail depending on your sizes that's a lot of models in a sheet right how do we get that down so lamp can more efficiently run you probably notice we have some you know seasoned people in here that the more models and more references you have in the layout pile the worse it works right it's gotten better as we've B to schet 24 hopefully better if we move forward but especially earlier on 20 21 22 the the bigger those files get this low out so that goes into the next one minimize the file sizes to keep it very smoothly and we also briefly already talked about avoiding the unlinking of the missing files I remember at times if you get one that unlinks we switched over our server approach and you go to an old job and every single details is UNL that takes an hour plus to go find where all those details were it's a total mess so those are the big ones let's look at the extensions real quick I'm just going to touch at these because we're going to look at them once we jump into skra um Auto invisible layer anyone use that perfect very very helpful changes the game and ENT off view Memory anyone anyone you C in that one I had either it's a really cool extension um and not quite extensions or plugins but your local libraries are very important too both on the SketchUp sign and on the detail sign let's go back to this one because we've got oh nope I'm going to go back one we're going to go right the way out so let's take a look at a so here we've G you probably saw this small similar to a getting draw that that first video right so I'm going to really quickly prove to you that having multiple models multiple scenes M details or one SketchUp model is much much smaller right if I just tell that to you you yeah okay sure but I'll prove it to you so we've got here is just uh two detail one mod I've got two details with two models the look at do set off I've got two completely separate models here right you'll get where I'm going in just a second full sheet and then same for one model all of our scenes multiple models all those scenes right and those are not just screen Clips if you're wondering really we Che but let's look at that so if we look at our layout files in our detail sheets so if we look at one detail one model they've got about you know 1,000 kilobytes right not that big a deal two details one model it's almost the same model but we've got double the geometry layup operates a little bit differently the way it reads it so it's almost double okay now what happens when we go to those full sheets full details one model 7,000 multiple mods 14,000 that's a lot right so when we started looking at our own internal sheets right we're dealing with very custom models like these can get very very big I've got to the point that we had our detail our detail Pages for just one sheet and you go this is s you know 0.1 one sheet new file 0.2 move on and it's just to keep it lout running smoothly so what we decided to do is how we make this and it was actually part of Nick's input here how we bring these into one model let me jump into one so here's we got I don't know that sorry that's the wrong mall that J Around s you guys let's go to that detail we had here if it one so okay doesn't that's so what we have here is let's just jump I'll skip half a step it's not that big a deal so what we have here is we're actually reusing the geometry as best we can the components the groups and just updating our scenes so if we take a look at our tags I'll probably call those layers a couple times it's no big deal uh we watch what's turning on and off here right so if I come in I look at where we had I'm reusing geometry that's limiting the size of our layout file so how do we do that how do we create that or per open so it was actually much more difficult before we discovered the auto visible layer so for those that do not know how that works what we can do is we can turn this on now every layer that we add past this is not going to go to any existing seeds right we've done that before everyone I'm assuming in sketch up where you make it and then every single one of your see you have to go back and redo total pain takes a bunch of time so let's just for the sake of this how is that differ from the add hidden layer extensions I don't know that extension so I'm not sure okay now couldn't answer that probably it's probably very very similar um and they are talking about uh that might become an addition into SketchUp directly too we might not need the ex station the auto invisible say what the auto invisible layer uh yeah South 4 you so let's just look at that let's just go ahead and add OV or whatever doesn't matter for what we're doing and that's just for the heck of it sorry drafting on this little tiny area is not really easy guys my bet okay so let's just really quickly this is not D pre and this isn't going to a jurisdiction so no one y'll be over here just group The just put that on OB okay so now most of our time when we're doing details is not necessarily saved in sketch out it's saved in layout right it's all those little clicks it's all the call outs that's really going to save you time so the closer we can have our scene the better so let's just do this and turn off our her oh let's just put a red back in here for looks weird right cryp share I'm just going to save this as so we don't mess up my file normally you would just save it no let's just save it I don't care if I mess up my f it doesn't matter right so let's make a scene just follow the scene too that's my I'll save it okay let's just update this one so we noticed nothing's really changed that detail is all good there was a bug in 23 a little bit in 22 where if you did that it would jack up all your the but that's been fixed in 24 so this is now current file sorry normally I work on three screens okay so now here we are all we have to do now was come in and tweak but you can imagine if you took this whole detail and redid all of these leaders it's going to take you a lot of time right and that's what we're trying to save so that's the brief one right I know I'm a little bit jumpy but I want to get to the fun stuff because that's the full F so let's move back to this and what are our detailing goals let's look at this first one right what do we do to minimize the time required oh I hate you wrong oh boy I'll get there I'll get there I'll get there next one come on why we could sketch up and enough car points okay so let's look at the first one right these other are also going to fall in a little bit we're do it again but minimize the time required to find already drawn details okay the biggest isue issues um the bottom one is what we'll start with using Windows Explorer is not the option right going to your your drop holders and typing in well I want her floor uh hydronics and waiting for all those details to pop up go into that job folder finding that detail opening it up Bing the page that's on copying that bringing it back handle you get the idea right I can't do it one breath the other one is the searching in scrapbooks inside layout is not posed right if you have a limited Library you can do it with the the scrap of titles but our library internally is over 6,000 details that's a lot for layout to process continually it just slows it down it can't do it if I'm the one drafting them all and I'm the one fighting all the details you can make it work but if you're working with a team everyone has to know where to find those details because they didn't draw they have to we look so we came up with was the Z detail Library current internal version 14 detail Cy categories Broken Out by 26 models into 180 layout scrapbooks and over 6,000 planned ready structural vils all in one file let's look at if I can find an there is the Z detail Library so what we had to do is figure out a way to quickly find all of these details strapex wasn't it window Explorer is not it so what we created was this this is a 1900 page PDF document yeah 1,00 pages so what we're going to do is I'm going to click through just really quick all of our abbreviations on not going to read these all for you sorry we'll figure it out as we go so here's what we're going to do here's our primary index so let's start with or we looking at floor to floor right so let's look at a floor to floor detail how's that size okay so floor to four all three doesn't really matter that's just our sorting so we're going to go floor to four okay um what do we think hydronics no hydronics someone call it out hydronics hydron so we're hydronics and what are we use it for the floor solido trust tgis TGI TGI with hydronics okay so we're going to go floid floor to floor hydronics and what about uh interior or exterior so we've got a continuous choice or we're at an exterior wall exterior wall exterior wall okay exterior wall uh tji with hydronics cool now what do you think per or parah parah wall above yes okay all above and below okay currently in the library that's the one detail we have set okay I can't do any of this I'm not going to screen clip it but check this out let's note the page all right I'm going to close this so I don't cheat nothing's open nothing behind the curtain so I can find Blue Bean and we went where we do we parallel above below there's my ready to go detail I'm going to copy that I have it over the template let's just do that recast so blank detail template right I'm going to copy that group they'll mine like very slow pop to of here there we go okay or just a little bit well all right and once uh close that one let's just grab another detail where the heck of it Foundation we're going to go out of order on these plan sets that's okay jump to index let's go uh let's go Foundation what do we have concrete or CMU concrete concrete let's just go with A continuous pudding uh let's just go with a wall right and let's say slap so we're going to go right there stem with wall soon will fall that detail that we want or let's just say we want fa these details doesn't matter Jesse can you explain your how you're getting jumping from the I was waiting for somebody yell for that that's Nick that does it so yeah let me let me paste these in so what we've done is we've essentially created a hyperlink PDF right so if we look at so we see these that this this is where it takes a lot of plle a lot of time is this scrapbook is where that page is located the one found concrete continuous right and it's listing out the page it's on which we'll meet but we've essentially created a hyperlink that's telling this thing where to look to open that files all those files are located on a folder on our server that's never going to change location and we avoid all of the hyperlink or the the unlink and all the missing issues right I won't go into how hydr link that that's it's googleable and you need good PDF software do that blue be blue Bean does it yep Blue Bean will do it like here using this is Blue Bean yeah this is the older version of Blue Bean but yeah yes uh okay so there's kind of the round moment but let's go and let's just open this up so you can get a sense of what it looks like to have multiple models in one or multiple details in one model like we did it earlier that was just one Quicky okay well what we do but again if we think about the time it takes to generate details it's in layout so if we can keep those scenes the same as the geometry SC it's going to be much quicker to recreate your detail so we're going to do that really fast that's if SketchUp the size to O So by opening it in SketchUp through yes are you potentially uh alter your existing life if I save and not if I work you're one step ahead of me so yeah that's that's a very good point those that are not run across this if I go in and I alter an existing detail in SketchUp and I save that it's going to then update all those details in all of the prior projects which is why we save as details right if you're doing a project specific detail but if we're looking at this where are you here's where we are let's let's just see what we're looking at for scenes here no find the these are all the seams that are built into this detail and this is actually one of the smaller ones but so let's just say we have this detail and now we're going to go we don't want to alter where this has been anywhere else we have a very custom specific situation we need for this job this is where one of those plugins come in let's just select all let's just copy this thing let's go to extensions now we're going to go we'll leave that on uh we're going to do orb another one enter off view Memory so what this is going to do is it's going to memorize the view that we have currently with all of the tags layers and fog any sections if you're write sections that it's going to memorize it right here here so we're just wanted to memorize the view now as Eric brought up here don't save just in case you did something we were close got a free and now this super cheap has 2025 box okay R and a rough what and a r view Memory I would sketch up trying trying laptops have okay dead time cuz we're not on the Rew okay okay so let's just go haste out of the place right so I have this and let's just make our edit real quick let's just say um I don't know we wanted it doesn't even matter right for some reason we've got you know a box that we have right here or something that we wanted to just add to our detail for winner doesn't matter right so now if we're going to try and match that exact fart by hand it's not going to work so when we relink and layout all our leaders are going to do it every work and then you got to spend five minutes fixing it all let's do this go back to that plugin let's Rec call of view right and we're just going to match our custom style that we had before add a scene save this just made this Bol is the V memory uh memorizing the the style too yes it does memorize the style it applies the style but then it doesn't quite update it so the easiest way to do it is to go back it's going to ask you to create a new style so I just click on custom style once so it doesn't yell at me uh we're just going to save this thing uh where was it at here Qui PA har so I bra out there no bu so let's just do it to this detail here now we're going into the detail doesn't matter has Hydra it's all in the same detail let's just relo this there what fox go here Hydraulics away so I could just reuse that call out this is going to be Box by ER yay so right there we just used our library to create a detail that's very very similar and we only had to alter one call out in that brand new detail so if you play this ahead or you know you have some kind of a detail is close you can save a tremendous amount of time what would that take most people read that detail 10 notes 5 minutes 3 minutes if you're really fast so wble that thing out so that is a huge huge time saer uh questions so far who else has got some anyone are kind of clocking fast and all over face but so you started off to PDF files in Blue Bean yes and and you copy what what was it was it do catchup La you might copy it a group in layout let's let's do another one I'll walk through again let's just pick a new one uh flusher beam that one and let's just call it that okay so what we have is a PDF page in in Blu day or whatever PDF editor that you're using again not free versions of anything they not going to be able to handle stuff like this uh but good blue beams uh good Adobes stuff like that can do uh fancy stuff like this so what we have is we are just going to click the hyperlink look so that exists on that page as what links to this is just a Creed PDF this is not the is at b y it's right here it's licking to a page it's all right so we're just this is essentially just an 8 and 1 half High load of BP there's nothing here in the PDF except this when I click that I'm going to note my page her to per right I can go over here to my pages and layout per per that's the detail I want now what this is is a view and a SketchUp model right if we look at just you if to have layout open or no it will open layout but layout likes to take a long time to open but if layout is not open it will open layout for then open that sketch or strap absolutely so foring this strap book have everything preloaded so I missed the first part your entire library is pre-loaded in your sprp yes yes uh which are now not so large because it is in in right mod is to pre right so the idea was to make it how fast can our drafter find a detail who doesn't know where that detail exists so we look here this is the sketch of model of the scene herp to per to beam wall wall right then we got all this this is just layout text these are just metors we've changed our style a little bit in new ones but this is how we used to do it so being the professor have you figured out a way which would be really cool for using Keynotes to embed the data into each kind of components of roots and then you could automatically yeah I me there's we kind of had that internal uh uh pleasant argument let's call it and mostly me Pleasant arguing myself my head so an owner to listen to it um the problem I have with that is if our drafter who you know if they're a new drafter and they don't really know what's going on I don't want them to have copy something and then not catch it on the internal data so I know it's how you do your details but You' got you know essentially a bunch of embedded data and you just come in and you're going to grab I Ma I don't remember way you can do it with keyot yeah I don't I have to I have to play with it yeah uh what do you say when you say Keynotes Keynotes are using a numbering system so instead of having on Note with a leer to the element this as using a substitute a then creates the list uh right now when sketch up an auto text you can embed whatever you want your note to be in a component of rout and you can use auto text with your reader to identify it so you don't have to type up in there oh yeah what we did was we standardize was get where you do keos and this just goes back to the the scrapo thing we come out really greatly uh let's just say we didn't have thisis one label already I'll just grab the scene in the old school and probably Stu done today was it used to all Keynotes would be on CSI for that okay but kind of this mess J was looking at five digit Noble so if you look at the scrapbooks how to do these if especially be drawing a detail Pro scratch and it's just been a uh so we have here I want to do this you can come here really quickly have all this stuff pre-built so if you've got four or four detail colors you use often stuff like that yeah come in and then we just come in and start labeling this thing uh through a bit but just some of the back and the big case is the no cure we develop stays consistent throughout all your retails Let's do let's do one other one because I kind of skip the step I didn't mean to and I'm thinking too fast so let let go on here let's just take this detail um we're not going to do anything crazy to it but let's move back to generating a detail from the defel library right so we just saw we opened this one up let's go here let's copy the title the scene this is what made it brilliant uh in sketch up when they released the ability to search scenes that changed the entire approach that we can do in winar but it opens you will see why it just a sec hey as long as it doesn't crash hey we we're going be we also Dro people laptop we did PR laptop yeah yeah nice oh my goodness hold on there it goes okay Sak you I got my new Orion in the bag this isn't work so what we've got here is it comes down to how do we get to that detail to copy it to save it to a new file with Eno to create our new detail this little Edition is unbelievable I actually was talking to the knowledge have people about this yesterday and like well how do you do this and look well there's a search Mo so in layout right we know the scene we're looking for right there let's just copy that let's come back to that detail further detail All Copy extensions memorized View close open a new sketch app then we do the same process we just did WOW youing models for each one of these details they keep the the project that's Com when you're when you're doing a custom thing so if we think about for us internally you know we're running anywhere from 40 to 100 projects a year right and so if you have a custom detail that does not get immediately added to the library in our office I'm the only one that gets the mess with the library because no one else gets to screwed up I screw it up that's my fault but otherwise what we have is inside each job folder you have a custom detail location right and you're going to save any custom details for that job into that location so that it's referencing right there immediately layout uh if you don't have to make any changes to that detail or or you're just changing a call out layout you have to do anything that Mo just copy and paste it un detail and move on so this one delete we'll paste it in so why would you be keep creating a custom uh let's just say I have a well take this one for example I've done an example for you say say you got a w design bre front of a side oh yeah but that draw that one from scratch there was another one in my library for that Nick ready to draw that from scratch sorry he he calls me and goes hey you know you've got this backto back wood strall and I've got a vent that goes right through it can we do that okay give me give me half an hour uh anyways for an hour you had the revised r with the esape for the inspector on site yeah that's after call it me yeah like uh what do you think of this idea okay so anyway speak this the off topic here um Eric remind me what your question was you said why why we creating a custom oh detail model if you only changing a call out well you wouldn't that's what I'm saying if you're only changing a call out you would right okay but if you're going to come in and say if you make this one um with CA or something or I'll see after you Le three yet there it was that's what you were looking at it freaks out even though it's on the same style it's the style is correct but the style name is not what it brings it in so I just go to our custom detail style and then when I add the scene it's good right so let's just say this one and I don't know let's just say they wouldn't make this decking or something doesn't really matter or we just have a a concrete for it oh my God come on okay that was the bad button to click here me okay so the process I would have done here is we would have changed the color of Supply wh right I would save this thing I would go back to L right here and I would come in I would just relink right C there relink the model reference when you do have multiple um scenes the same model in a page and you only to update the one model reference you cannot do that through doc up up here cuz that will update the reference for all of the details in that file so what you do is we come in and we relink with a right click and that will relink that model only everything else will stay at the same see if I C out oh it did well let's just oh well steal that's fun and we're just going to go there I guess they open our tax roll request how about that we PR steel for steel yeah yeah and all the thing now uh go there and we'll right click just this small uh relate and there we go and then for this one I know we're have to end we'll just call this neat Co and this is a not so AO still H right well I got a friend that's a a metal Smith so it's aome Ste yeah okay okay okay okay that is the gist of the detail Library again there's so many details in there it's almost Cal now do we have questions continuing questions yeah your uh m Master directory is your oncustom uh details that's the same relative position for anyone my open that models that's so that's yeah our detail Library it is something we are Distributing it is for sale uh and so when we do that we have actually set it up so our Turtle version Pops to a different Drive than the version that you would install on your own PC and we do that straight into the the uh end of the C drop as an Z Library so that's never going to change you not drive well we actually don't it's proba we went to the C so you don't have to if we don't have people that know computers that well it's always going to get installed to the C C drive and then other not user no that's a user and it right now we we could do that we it very set it up that way but break your connection great you don't want to break the connection so we do it with map drives internally the first version that we've put out for public use didn't do that probably we'll switch to a m drive but we'll just teach people how to map that drive uh what just say you're working on Zack uh user Zack desktop layout file and you're mapping to your drive relative and layout so and that's first who opens that seeing file on there well that's why we didn't set up the initial version for public to be able to work on a network we did just for the local user r there again that's something we're working on for future releases but you have to cut the tight somewhere to get it out but I see what you're saying so internally that's how we do it it goes to a nap drive on our server and everyone is referencing that one drive so all the files go there at yber own weeks so it's it's doable there's videos of each step yeah along this process that describe how it will install it where it install it why it's install there yeah it's it's very I I see where you're going with it it's doable even if it's a workaround but it's very doable yeah anything else on the the library I try to talk really fast guys so we do have a little bit extra time so I'm going to hop into some full Excel stuff to layout unless we got some more Library questions M questions on details I hope you followed me okay I tend to talk quick no Okay cool so let's look at some new stuff uh I don't have this like totally prepped so bear with me as I talk through it so let's go to who knows that Excel can taught to layout has anyone done that with anything a little bit a little bit little bit okay so what we've got is um for this one essentially think of a project and you've got I don't know let's just say 10 different layout files for the same project right and just throw ran overse that's somewhere in the range for us usually it's a little bit more uh but you've got the te's task or the copy paste task of was saying redo the tile lock he not cart but it takes time and what happens is after you're totally s and done and then oh God the have gave you the B grass Nick I'm not talking about you uh and then I got to go back and I got to fix all those but I got to see right there 10 minutes what am I going to do right it takes time it's very very very easy anyone could do it but to go in all those files open all those files open up shle click go in update it's a pain right so here's what we started doing so we're just going to call this a job you know whatever we're going say basic Camp fun oh if it wants to catch up to me this is uh this is one of our Excel pal files so you even do this with any C file or any any cell phone any C file uh date May we'll just call this November it's thinking doesn't like their macros CL [Music] okay there a spell uh bis cat boss yay strange uh what we made B County CLK was it Clark oh Clark the okay okay yeah yeah okay so what we're going to do is we have created what we notice is this is a little bit of a workout I'll explain it in a second but all this data is now ready to go into our pile BL so we're just going to save that right I'm going to come into white dogs by reasoning this one one that's looking at oh cool that's kind of fun oh I forgot the AK oh Chief that's just I mean it doesn't matter for now faster right Excel is faster than layout when you're tiing so each one of those is just every any TI yeah you you just have to come in and generate reference to the same sheet yeah it's reference to a specific cell oh not it so it's each one of those references a specific a specific cell so if I you know if I look at the uh cell reference op it's going to that page and I'm telling you to not pull in the Excel referencing to leave it as layout referencing that I spent time matching what I want the title Bo to look CER and you know it'll do all this so how what to Breck the exacts pick the exacts down buil from Air on the detailing side this opens up a lot of possibilities on our custom King stud details and connection calls it's autogenerating all the quantities for each project based on the Wind loads sh teras Heights the whole nine so every job is different you don't have to then go into what that would look like I'll just grab it real quick for you you don't have to go in to say this table and you can imagine going in by hand updating each one of these cells to the correct one and you're even checking you know if your drafter does it or you want to double check your work going in and doing this that's better take a lot of time right so if you've checked your process at Excel so what we will look like here is this is all based on our calculations and then that the one time you relink it or if you change it and you update the reference it's all going to update ma for you that's the big one in the detail sign um in the next presentation you know in a little bit we are doing it with anchor bolt schedules Downy how do you see e it for SCH e it for schedules like thegu the limit uh and you know we've just scratched the surface of how this can kind of speed out our plan sets but think of code references think of all that stuff if you've got IBC versus CVC you know all that stuff can be updated and then based on the state you're putting in right it can then know to update all of your noes and schedules it just takes a lot of time to build the stuff and a lot of kind to Think Through It or yeah i k out a elect schedule in itself cell and I didn't want any lines in it but when I imported it in the layout there's a bunch of lines that I could not get rid of so the lines in the tables in layout are kind of a pain sometimes so if we if we just do this and generate it on your table right look something like that is right so what you have to do is you have to give me a second I don't have to do this very often but when we go into if we click the line directly and then turn your stroke CL it'll disappear and then when you're doing your sell reference right turn off the import formatting I think what he's referring to I sh same call is if you create an entire chap uh a s cell and then you want to have it read and layout the form thatting just doesn't across that you sha and cells or yeah I have no line worry it brings in every single line in the Grid it's a big pain it's it's a pain and that's why it takes a minutes to get the first one right I ran into that and it might be a little bit difference a different situation but like on these all these were junk when I brought them in the first P yeah and you have to go in you know make it how you want it line it up and then turn off that reference here and when I did that it worked for me this import Excel formatting just turn it off yeah I haven't seen that before yeah so that's um when you reference it are you referencing or are you inserting I just uh I was just copied pasted oh okay do it as an insert insert the uh file so here and the uh one of the other options that I did was I created a template and sketch up for the formatting of the schedule I want and then I overlay it with the Excel one so I can white out ones or or Shades in between break up yeah the look yeah that's a ways to do it but if you can get the formatting you like in that table and then turn off that you know right click it and go to your Excel reference offers you just paste I'm pretty sure it's just pasting in the table it will not talk if you insert that as a non macro enable Excel file it will talk and reference has to be non macro though so you see on RS we've got I've got this work and in between file this is called you know exam Bing to layout this is not macro our C file all macro Z and layout hat macros it won't it calls it a risk it will not import that file so I have to take it for one Excel really quickly into the other one and then take that of the layout that took a lot of trial and error figure out and now once it's there make it how you want and then uh yeah reference options turn off your cell format and you should should because I'll try that we yeah file it I for you chance you cck Bel yeah 10 minutes um talking about how we number our tips or AG oh right that just one quick I'll is uh I don't use all of my like K walk stuff is done in a model yep that's the way to do it and i' I love it just because it updates like asess I change the sheet size that it goes us yeah lot lots of ways to do it you know for us is just how we how we found is the quickest way for us to do it oh yeah even there's that way to do it I'm sure we can sit here and brainstorm and come up with eight or nine other ways to do it too uh a lot of this stuff is a sketch of a layout is all about how complicated do you want to make it work for you right you can make it as basic as complicated whatever works through your process there's so many things that are possible right we can all these different presentations here you're going to look around and I'm going to contradict someone else is going to contradict someone else we might agree on this but guess what all our processes work right it's about what works the best and most efficient for your setup uh and this is what we found works the best for our style our setup and then which relates into the library and our library then talks to layout so it's you know for those people that don't have those systems I mean I recommend our style system I think it works the best those that have other systems that work great by all means if that works for you that's great right uh did mention K label so let's talk about that really really fast our detail sheets and actually let's do this in a set real fast uh this is actually a hi project Mr SL we'll be talking about this tomorrow uh so we've got our cover page full 3d PDF on the cover right yeah we'll talk about this later tomorrow but really quick now we you know this is the old school version we've changed a little bit since then but it's the same concept so s0 so zero in this set is denoting details and then one is the page number and we go straight from that page number and huh right there there there which was actually this allows us to do this will show it really quick is actually hyperlink our play sets so if we come down and let's just say we want to look at uh I'll find a good one this detail right here and not in a PDF cleans set I have 607 well what's the way you do that you go back to page six CU you know where that is and go from there or we can just cook it and we can go 60 so oh that's the detail of ly 4 right have pretty good idea you know I'm done there and go back oh what about this one 905 what's going on there I five you shouldn't been hurting s say what oh yeah I forgot about those no so it's a detailing presentation you're like out here on you uh so the sign's bad the other one we started hyperlinking which is a great deal it works in your details like let do it from a detail so are you Happ to set the hyper for each oneall to each details it's no I do L sorry I do L be it's no B like I'm saying in blue be now you are I bash link it so linking an entire sub like that takes me 10 seconds oh 15 seconds so if we look at we find a Simpson product here got so it's Rec recognizing that as your three digit now uh here's a big example so J espb I don't have to sorry F this 62 is winning T this one not I you want I'm on the internet hold on I'll get there guys of course I can't find BL this one's not hydrolink sorry that's that so we do reverse but no it will reverse but if you're in blue beam and you use the step back button yeah it's essentially reverse y but I can't go and that's because there's there's only one detail but multiple positions that that detail might occur and so and pages so where do it send you is it doesn't know uh do that to all the contractors some no I can I have try was a big note on there and shows bu the yeah here we go this is one that just got submitted uh and we actually just finished up the steel shop drowing that was the description right V yeah here we go this will work so this is our you know this was on every that because you V amazed how many contractors can figure that out uh it's relatively intuitive CL this helps but in addition to the detail linking we also have this built into all our plan sets oh c cool what is an HC that's a Simpson hanger which now is opened up and I can visualize what that is well here has St but you get the concept actually calls up S catwalk or that red tail ship what it is and it also describes how it's talk there you go so that's giving you everything you need straight off of the plan set which in the field say to put the hurricane straps on her side in this in Das yeah it's an app so once I take it I can plow a whole set I'm running a bash link uh which I it doesn't run as very uh or i on my I was spirti you're just running essentially a CSV file and it can't restrict so it's got to be a CSV and then you can go through it bash like and it'll run through the whole thing you need to go back and and seene it up a little bit uh on so the hiker Lakes like if you for the detail version like if I have if I'm calling a stem elevation of 100 it's going to read as detail 100 so I always go back CU it's just looking for the numbers so I'm just going to go back and delete that hyperlink so I click 100 on the St like it it doesn't really matter but I get annoyed by that so Takes Me 3 minutes to set to clean up but I yeah you doing the linking like in in are you doing anything in layout to prep for that no it's just your number system okay so that's a really question yeah yeah how that works we find me find tomorrow I can watch through a little bit more but it is a Bluey I try to do that stuff through layout and make it talk between and just it's not capable yet it might be soon except that's cunning but it's not currently there so that was our workaround so we got five minutes left um our next course is going to be just down the hall here and it's going to be our modeling process this is the Gateway drought if you want to convert an engineer from AutoCAD to SketchUp that's the one you want to down for we're considering boxing out putting a ribbon on our modeling process and putting it out to the world and that is for very low price you could have an engineer break away from arcad and be entirely sketch up in three or four weeks with a full set full project that's all to redo uh yeah the first project of you y is is that including the engineering or just like the convert no just just doing the entire model the plan setup and all the details and that would be to here's how to use SketchUp and layout to generate your plan SI we're not going to tell you how to do your own engineering but we will you know here's the process to take that and put it on paper using new softwares to like I T could my version of structure into a model so if I have an engineer that you can receive that then and a lot of the bogling are sure so then they could take that process right and essentially and if you're working with them you could use the layering system ahead of time right drop it in for them they drop it in open it up they want to layout templat a notch and there's their set they just have to run through how they would daring walk through the label and showcase their son at that point yeah all pro all of our stuff is based on how Nick set it up starting a one yeah so it works and it continues to work really well and then drastically briefed the professor know about draft I certainly didn't change it I expanded yeah uh anyways any other questions I don't know is it next like yeah it's next it's an half an hour be way it a full so there is that's the one thank you uh that one's not going to be as choppy but that one we are going to going to actually build that PO PL set we're not doing it for a massive necom I'm going to do it for a little home right it's only an hour uh but that's what that one's going to be about uh visit our website check it out you know we've got the store talk about the the detailing package we also are looking for an interest win on the plan process on W stop and there's a link on our website you zck in there put your in flow on if we get enough interest we'll create it people don't want to purchase it cuz I have to call Jess here a production that do actually cre to to finish here yeah which is very expensive thank you for having hanging out and listening to my Railways and the jumping back and forth but I hope you got a little bit out of it you're welcome to come find me I'll be wandering around the halls to talk some more so I every once [Applause] [Music]
