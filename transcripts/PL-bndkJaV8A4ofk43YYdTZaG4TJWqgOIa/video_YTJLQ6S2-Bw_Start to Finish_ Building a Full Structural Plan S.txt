h [Music] I think we're going to start it um at our last deal with this details but this time we're going to be going through the entire month because it's actually going to be building draw from start to start to finish including the the plan sheets um how many people are architects in here s old how many uh Engineers a couple how many architect or contractors that want to their engineer to move from autocab to sketch okay this is your class this is um we are uh potentially providing the gateway to solve that problem quickly and efficiently uh but anyway start on David Zachary um president Zachary engineer is Jesse Brown is our senior project engineer uh we uh uh are licensed in all those days and up in British Columbia we centrally work out of tow we do all that work for all the states in one spot um I'm also a pilot so I can fly around to the the different projects um we been in business since 1998 and I have over 30 years experience in this fi and uh in 2009 with Nick sers help all know Nick Saunder rose again um he he got me into SketchUp and from there we went to 100% SketchUp been doing ever since and we over the years developed uh our detail library and now this modeling process that we're going to show you today and see about if you guys are interested that I'll give her thank you hello everyone uh we'll try to do this without totally dising the screen okay um who buil PL had some land St the land most of us okay I see Pro back there it was obvious yeah here was good one yesterday so anyone that gets digital twins tomorrow again her Thursday okay good presentation so what we're going to look at today is kind of our process starting from you know what we get an architectural model and how we produce the structural drawings and they're actually ring for Cent and for CDs uh it's going to be a little bit abbreviated we've only got you know probably 50 minutes before a Q&A so I'm not going to model the whole thing for you that was my goal but when I tested it it's a me 22 minutes instead of 10 from all this house so that was that ba you got to see at the very ba we'll touch on it and still run through the process but I'm not going to sit up here and draft for you we just don't have to PR uh so yeah we're going to start with the architectural mall and they kind of look at our setup scripts and our setup on how that relates to our internal component libraries and then how those then relate into our layout templates templates are important uh think a little bit how we're going to build the ax drer model for the use used for that uh building it with the layout templates so that they pop looking at our detail library and building those detail sheets that relate to the specific plan uh we're going to look at some of the uh extra fund invol some of the extensions we use on a relatively regular basis and how we use those to help us be more efficient uh and then a full couple uh full set example of some recent projects so you can kind of get a sense of the projects that we do but the one we're working on today which we can see here is just a small three-car garage SEL California Marcus as Architects uh and did a small one so that we can actually get through at least the majority of PL set the stuff takes time to build and we don't have lots of it so let's go right to it and boom so phone okay so over do we start with our model which is going to be this well that's loading that's top about the roqu uh building CL sets and layout do use a section approach no kind of so you've got you basically one raser at the nier approach you've got a rascar vector you run a you know run a section down that gives you your cut that generates your bement right the kind ofor we use more of a raster Vector staff approach you know kind of the same thing but a little bit different you mean stack viewports stack viewports yeah is like yeah right so the way we had this set up is we've got raster on the bottom you know and that's basically be our framing it's going to be figured out so you can see the other side above columns beams Shear all that was stacked above so that we get our nice view and pl set so with that in mind it's how we had to set up our layering system in Sketcher if layering tags we know sorry uh so here's what we get from an archat essentially we'll get this model uh coup with their layout documents so we can match our plan set to the exact spot on the page that they do um probably a progress set in PDF for uh which is helpful in case where's missing information in the allow so what we're going to do is we're going to take this thing and we're just going to really goody clean it up so that we can use it for our stuff so let's go to just believe your scenes I don't need Aral scenes at all right looks fine I'm just going to run as a quick little chap in case I'm just going to purge it don't use in my opinion don't use Purge very often at least in your um model info because if you've got your template layers or your template stuff and you have it drop that AI yet and it's all set up you go click Purge everything all those layers that don't get they want are gone and your scoll I did that on a project I was TI cost they half de um I cre a placeholder that main case yeah no there there's ways but it happens so we're just going to pain this uple Okay cool so now what we're going to do is we're going to run proprietary scripts right I always get the question doing you know the style of presentation is well why don't you just use uh a sketch template that has all this stuff already built and the answer really is you know because there are a lot of different styles and models there's a lot of different Architects we work with there's a lot of different software that we import if I need to copy and paste all these different models not everyone generates grade models it could take 5 or 10 minutes to copy a model and qu to our template where I'm just going to sit at the desk going that's a lot of waste of time right so what we're going to do is we're going to look at this house and I know I've got you know a slap Foundation I'm not going to go show you the plans that confirms that that Foundation one story so I know that for our script right I'm going to be a one story script for the slab foundation so on here you see what I'll run it and then explain what's happening so I've got Clans right I've got SL and grade or friend floor for one story I also that for mys right we're just going to run the side gr just ride give the SEC on the old that pot it's it's trying it's that I swear it's not the slopes we can see that our tags was scarly populated on the right there and that's thing not happy sorry about that okay well as it's thinking what we're doing is we're generating all of our tags and all of our scenes so we see at the top here all of our scenes are now set up all of those scenes have the correct tags associated with them now so if I undo our structurals here as I work my way through this oh I skip this stuff but that's okay we'll fix it just we're going to look at the right here and you can see as I click through my scenes my CS are changing okay so let fix my M State here way do again we're just going to select all all the Aral stuff that's still there and I'm going to BR right I'm going to add that to my architectural sketch off the model okay so what did that script do we generated all our scenes all our tags we imported custom Styles um which are in here right import our custom Styles uh we sent it to parallel projection on the top view for all the scenes that needs to be we went to isometric view on the ones that need to be isometric uh I deleted majority of the guides that are in there there was more way work one in there uh what else they do plenty right it turned fog on on all my raster scenes so that's all there all I have to do is now update how I wanted to look but now from here we're set to go we can move towards how we're inol this thing so internal how many run internal component libraries not just the extension Warehouse stuff that's local it's a good idea to start building that stuff honestly right uh we've all had the issue a warehouse decides I I don't want to workot right now uh which is always fun we try to find something super specific so let's go to AR Point library and we go one story frame four that's we ran our script with right so we're progressing one story frame floor this is going to drop in everything I need where are my Shadows showing that shouldn't be happening anyway we'll get the idea so here everything you bring in from the component Library is a component first that where it is it's 12 that so now what we have is all everything we need to start can model with structure Health away from F Falls Foundation various options that's going foret crazy sorry Shadows are not problem thank you okay uh all these are potential sizes that I might want to build my pre-engineered model with but I'm not sure I know that for we V A projects with Sova I'm going to go 4 by8 4x8 6x8 adding on the architectural wall sizes so I'm going to work on these now what's important as Eric was bringing in earlier is that this isn't traal information which is why we're bringing it in and not just redrawing one stuff we are using the component info it's on a specific CAG which is important because we set up the steel shot layers on that script also so every model is ring for us to do seal shops if necessary the instance this 6X 8 right which is different or each member is what we're going to use for our PL setep ler right so I'm going to skip the magic part we're not going to actually model this thing cuz we're going to go straight into what this model looks like after now we're going cop about the shear walls real quick because those are important those are Dynamic components that's the colored wall which you'll see here in a second the blue one uh so what we're doing internally on those make rraw we know DW is little bit so when you're doing I'll short T essentially Dynamic components when you're asking it to do internal populations will not always redraw itself without being prompt into do that I'll show you so if I look at you know this blog here and look my Dynamic component so what we do again while we're dropping this stuff in we're asking the emic component to spit out the aspect ratio the height the length and then we also have sheer labels for when we actually get through design and that's going use up on the plan side we spit out the length and we spit out the shear label directly from the mod onto our CL okay so I do this oh Mak any if I come display which is about 6 in what we notice is that it did not update the length right this is actually about 4.75 ft not 4.25 ft so I need to redraw and then oh look that's spoke my every but so something keep in mind on those that's something when we drop these things we have to do to each time or we have the plugin which I think is still available on the extension Warehouse which is redraw all which is e anyways moving on so here we are we've got this model built now we can take a look at our scenes we can go through these and now we start to see what that script did right it droke these all out so that we can stack these down and then we now have different viewports those are some of the custom Styles we imported for the cover page right we set up all these scenes so we have different isometrics for the cover cage which helps contractor look just at the cover and go oh and I see eight pieces the seal that was like a lot of foundation I have a pretty good idea what this is going to cost not perfect but it's close right so let's go let's start with the plan set so what do we use we use one story slap right very notice I keep chiming on that script tomorrow the lay on here's what we're going to do we're going to open that file new my templates who's got a template set up in L out yeah good you added the folder so you easy access bit all right so we've got one story M sets one story frame floor nope one story SL we not w we know it's a 24 by 36 from the architectural sheets it's open up so what we'll notice here is these are all built out for that one story level I've got a roof Shear plan which notes already built in right roof Fran Clan notes I have my anchor plan notes out to the Sid is where they got put a St elevation plan same kind of thing Foundation plan statement special inspections General notes and a structural cover sheet right so let's just get this going that's our model and if I can remember where I put this thing oh I didn't figure to mention if you have questions as I go just ask them don't wait till the end okay that's we'll be fine you near have with a blank model that is it's a basically a um it's a holder model if you want it's a template model so I do that so when we run the script everything is already set up and I just throw our logo in there as a placeholder so I know where he is on the screen you can actually see here I've got a note just relink the print model that's so you know if someone else is doing this somebody D my new droter is doing it they just know really don't get lost so that's the model we're working on we're just going to open it that's going to all the performance cool so here we are now we could take a quick look well that look pretty good right now I got CLE this up a little overit there but that's fine so move it up to side to uh we do know we do know the red box something isn't quite grabbing right now so again because that was grabbing a different part of the viewport that's now elsewhere and we do that I used to be I used to have templates for multiple scales and I got really tired of updating multiple templates so we built it into the dport you know so it could change this we can just change it then you just got to change the scenes it's easier to change a couple pages of scenes for scales than it is to update your templates three times a year that's kind of a cool pain okay so from this point what do we have we've got all this stuff set up cover sheet set up now we go okay this has been go to a design now we have to get the thing designed we're going to skip the engine room part of this and just work on the plan I do want to show you one quick thing that is in here it's kind of a something we've worked on kind of spent a bunch of time on because the output isn't there um but for instance if a drasar gets this and wants to have a really quick idea well I'm not sure that's the right size I want to help them out on the design side I want to size this correctly now okay that's fine so what we're going to do is we're just going to come in here and this is again built into those coupon we dropped in um I'm just going to for the sake of this just to show off we're just going to say that there's a bunch of snow in nepro there's not for those that don't know much about Neo uh we're just going to say it's 100 PS under 50 psf snow and all I need to get it now is the tributary Ri so 23 and 1/2 ft so let's just call 12 ft for be a little bit conservative 12T there's no overhang okay let's just apply and we can come down here and look at oh man it's reading the geometry and the opening I'm almost 4 100% of strs that's not so good right so let's just notice I haven't made those unique because it's the same geometry same opening sizes let's just make it a littleit bigger let's make it a six b b and we have redraw up 242 that's not so good we're getting a little bit big on I'm going to go to cland let's go to Bland that's not a standard size so we're about another 1 in right we can be do minut 10 well by 10 after we draw still not I call now oopsies we see this is iterative process for presentation that's not awesome but for a drafter who's just trying to help out okay great if it gets me a sign when it comes to us to design cool that's awesome right almost there we excited let's just go up free make it work probably a 50 in blue boom okay so as a starting point I can see right here about 98% I probably still a little bit bigger I did through design but I know that that's pretty good right so now you can do is for labeling the pan and for the designer when he gets this not 51 1/2 5 1/2 in by now where 15in spol Ling all right oh now I've got something to work with we'll save that and W on a full house is designed rly so let's go back to we always start C on way down one of those Dynamic components where are you adding those attributes or in attributes I'll show you and that's all just in there that's how I had to go t I go out yeah this is all internal custom stuff yeah and there is another one that we we'll jump into soon which is the stand elevations that are automatics but that's in so let's go back in here let's update that's rarely cookie labeled to SP okay so now because it's internal data I'm only going to do a couple of these because it's you know we don't need to root every being oh I'm on the wrong layer sorry guys minimal layers that we operate from in layout that's built into the templates uh that's our the frings are raster the rest of these are vector that are sack in that order so that your comms are above beams and above SHO here so that on the plan they show up above those and then our Lings call out the colors which are above a we'll see that on can side little bit there so here we go you show on the right layer we're just going to label these three right here all turle vo okay and then we're going to just draw the root lines in real aqu then scrapbooks who knows that we can grab styles scrapbooks and up stuff all right grab your style there we're just going to do the rids real quick no this that's fine I know as I done this house already I bu in the six and 12 roof um who use a spa to find a document yeah anyone else no I don't have the the shortcuts let me put them in here real quick CU that's a really cool one it be control h be uh no I've changed it but you can the out buts but what it does is it'll find either on the page or in the document you can change multiple call outs of the same kind it's really helpful if you have a detail on a pen set that gets stive and you haven't submitted you are fill in that ypro pit without G table all of them you move laston down and goes from you know search the plan set for detail 5 team and it'll replace it with 560 whatever it's just again avoiding a bunch of clicks and this is just the 6 and 12 oopsies okay I'm not going to worry so much about the notes um we know in this case I draft for them is pmps Community effector Trust is that's what up being on this house which is just about done by the way I'll show you photo later and essentially there are no connection details that I need to pull out on this sheet um because this is a very very simple house uh for instance if we had I know if we had some kind of a a post and beam skirt roof or something out here that's where I could drop Ben call up but this job doesn't recall that I'll look at some detail stuff I was share well so there we have and this is all then we called out and know what we're going to do is we're going to transfer manually I'm still working on something to do that's not manually uh but all of the versions have M out so well so what we're going to do is we're just going toh our walls but our structural G all we do want to rise here so that when we get down to the next level down we can see what's going on above without hiding to have that sheet over let's just grab that thew in okay so now I'm dat Foundation typically at this point I'm not going to do M on the foundation plan I'm going to go up and either going to go up to the shear plan or multiple stories obviously go upper and then mid and then Foundation this us is only the one story so let's go up to the shear plan and look at this one these are the shear walls I've predesigned them just for the sake of shown with the clip line but our drafter when they set up this lab document we're going to go into our strap books but let's just do a pize here notice you see the the red I'm missing something all this is built in information relays to those sheres that are already doing automatic information cors so now that they are late if I go back into the model and I need to make this window a little bit bigger and I alter these Shear walls I redraw them these are going to update on the ls right I don't have to do it B I don't have to go look at the Cal set and go o well is that a four it doesn't matter cuz it's already in the mod right and so now what we're going to do is we're going to check the Cal which I have here already re built out and we've got some small hold Downs in here but let's look at the the nailing first so everything we do we operate off of brids and not a lot of people in some areas that we've worked with work for grids we'll establish grids then but that's allows us to good PR either the face of foundation or face of stud and that those those Dimensions they carry throughout the entire project leure you get started so what we're going to do is let's just start with r a so that's over here now grid a and grid B are the two that are go go to 4 in Center alley based on the design again we're skipping the design part so A and B D propon sheer label Pi you cannot do this to multiple different proponents at the same time and let it work correctly it's not going to work correctly so you just really quickly do do it from scratch we used to do it where the shear label would pop up as a double exis in here and I realized that's really D because if I'm not changing it it should be a six wall anyway why am in make war c car start of all six walls and then the so I'll save that and now my [Music] nailing in a sticky about oh and I've got number four walls it's good to go goes up dat I do the same thing but this is all link so that the lay bar only has to be done once okay so let's move down that line let's go to uh grid dsps I don't really need to show well um so PR B I need dt2 Z's notice what those are from any hold Downs little tiny baby once thanks John that's uh so you know we use to do this uh with just these and we come in and we just drop these whole bands in we change the C outs we still do this on the shear sheet uh I did perforate these walls so let's just do it in one of the wall lines whoops so we're just going to come in here and I'm just going to call these out right h2z so initially that's you know what it's going to look like now when I transfer it down I'd like to also have these in the mod we found that the market is dicating on the contractor side that we start dimensioning these hold Downs worth so we can think through the king STS we can think through ready reenter corter details we can think exactly where these hold Downs are obviously when they get their window shops s right that they may change little bit but that does good in a very Cru started C and typically your window shops are within you know an eigh to a/ in difference typically so usually you stay within degree out of P three or rule for S if you B 18 in even if all just a hair so what we're actually doing is we going through dimensiones and drop the real ones in to the m and that's important again we'll talking about internal information from our Eon Library hold down this is all buil in already going to expel that regroup it I don't like to work on components to be components for possible so again you bring things in from the library it's a component I like to explode that component then if you're going to regroup it regroup it but components and components can get a little bit hairy on baby BS right little one is so up like stuff happens but on big ones if you're not careful it can become a problem so let's just go ahead and brought these in real quick I've already bet you know I SW one king here with the belel trend that's just what we're using as an example and actually for this case let's just do the opposite let's go one under the window just for the aggravate which is probably how I would do this anyway because then as something shifts out it doesn't usually cause that much of a Prof so let's save that I'm back to L so up it and what I'm going to do is I'm going to take imagine that this is for a whole structure I'm just going to group close fold Downs right I'm just going to group this and as a check for myself I'm just going to copy that and I'm going put it on what we are calling the foundation anchor plan right okay so here we go oh I I decided in H I wanted to go to the other side so so let's just shift this down back to here leak out one now look got it Noti what it is that one looks about right I do know that I want to show the king side because that looks super awkward right so let's do that breaker fix it oops one more that's going to go on structure wood which only hours when we're doing steel shops but it a just good have it we didn't talk about the seel all that much but that's okay you'll see what it ends up looking like and this also allows me to control the king there at that location cool so the two things I want to do on this Anor plan for these is I want to Dimension those rods I also want to call out what they are or are we using Rons are we using ssbs what are we using so again back to scrapbooks and this is actually a new one in uh 24 but when you drop things in if you gra your component it will auto update that text it didn't used to do that so if we go to hold down fallouts here what now here what's just about end Dimension these real quick there a huge di line in the center line oh oh there we go then we also know there's one more thing we want to add to an anchor sheet and that's here for bolt spacing right so we do have a cable for that oh that was terrible with the B let's go ahead and your HS okay those come in on the layers I like to see them on for our Tia so these are steel hold Gallas and then that be hold down themselves which we notice we don't see on the planer is on no shellware so you can see in the model but I don't have to do a bunch of crazy you know layering to makes it work I just throw it on one that says don't show it with my lay say that okay so now some cool stuff um I asked this in the detail session but who is familiar with linking Excel to layout we got one rock you do that ran you have so we find on some of our bigger projects especially um Nick does this a lot he has a lot of grid lines the way his designs work is there's a lot of Chang his acal with the way we try to optimize his sheer uh sure Sports so it's a lot of time if you think of a big file that has 35 rid lines we're dealing with to come back in and add in all this a for B spacing right what happens is oh well I actually want to use half Chambers instead of five8 so now you're go back into the schedule and I got our update there by hand we're talking lot I mean Lots but 15 20 minutes which is a lot of time you're thinking about I just need to Tex some stuff in right so what we have develop is Ling our C anchor bolt schedules into layout so we're just going to really I'll come back to this CU we're talk about all the title box stuff too we just grab a [Music] file okay so we had out 32 h on Center 1 2 A and B there are no others 10 12 16s or 2 course mtic just these gits that's oh that matches what we're doing now just for the sake of showing you what if oh shoot I didn't want to do it that way I Ed label but he told me a long time ago he wanted to use half inch inkers okay we see that oh wellow that's a terrible example because you know say 32 but let's go ahead and just prove that that's going to work 93 yeah let's just make this uh what was that okay there we go well well no you again oh okay zero these are all Sprint sheets we create that yeah this is all inurance stuff so there we go now we now half iner at 12 we can see that if we just do that again 58 oh it's it's 16 now so let's just go back to half inch just to you know it all right we'll save that they update look our grids Chang we' got 11 12 32s and oh we by the way we changed the incable spacing or that's spacing size we also updated the size of the Titan option down in the schedule all based on that one click yeah XL so that saves us a bunch of time here volt s now we're say we got diens we've got our ESS called out uh typically we'll show non 32 in on Center uh AB spacing elsewhere we're going to see that's on grid two which are these little panels here we're going to say there and there all dupose the 12 just so you can see it and B okay my schedule's done next one is the fun one this is still relatively new so occasionally it gets a little bit buggy but again the market is starting to dictate that we specify St elevations and sometimes spting elevations right it's just what the market is wanting so we develop that in why do I want to do that all by hand what if it changes that's a lot of time right so what we have here is we bu this in and just so right know a lot of times we control the S too yeah we're doing the s design so we're setting stem elevations really helpes cordinate so again let's look back at our Dynamic components so what we're doing here is this is actually based on the elevation I know that I've got the um that's H datm tool I just used the one uh I have sent my dat from the top of slab would be 100 the garage so at the entrance and they'll have a deide to slope at and so what we have here is our different elevations are accurate to that elevation which isn't so cool in itself until you see this oh sorry about C keyboard now way more because I have to go out of it oh that elevation is now accurate to what is in the mall which is kind of cool now okay you say okay that's kind of cool but how's it say me about your client when I have to go back to the elevation plan to deal with that well we callor put of the elevation plan right so you minimize your call outs we do require that our plan sets be printed in color yes it's more expensive hopefully you only have do it once if you don't change things right what we have here is again scrapbooks notice I keep pinning the scrapbooks on the F here stand elevations uh we have VAR bit and again now that these are linked right what happens when we update M if anything updates in the M those are all going to un force or going to update Force right Dimension to the stem stops oh and it's done right adjust the notes as necessary I'm not going to get into notes those are pretty specific per engineering and then Foundation plan you know we've got here we started our hatches uh we can start doing some detail callums on this page again I didn't do them on prior Pages because there weren't any non-typical details that needed to be called out so we're just going to we're going to add a detail here and add a typical detail here notice again I'm using SC PR books all Foundation plan let's show one other thing I didn't think of this but it doesn't occur in this model oh let's just show what if we've got halfway apart right Highway that below same kind of thing the component Library addition oops wrong on hands B much just grab a 24 for the Hecker it let's just put it underneath this one oops that's going on my St for zero grp if you have the pants make your own grp Cod on the same layer doesn't really make the difference you just don't want to change the grouping uh once you label is black on link you have to rec click it as the red annoy you Le annoys me update that pad real fast cool so we see it right there scrapbooks notice that our our scrapbooks are broken down kind of by cage you know it's typically the same kind of callous on each page there so I know that these I'm going to call G beam which is great beam which is a little bit different detail the coroner garages who uses okay yeah little BW okay we'll do that so I can show it that way and then I'm just going to call this one out differently we'll just call this but I'm sure just internal so we can do this later we'll just SC just deal with those details and so we look at this Foundation plan uh we got one other thing we need to add here all you know typically if we know what the AR is looking for we could put our our slope lines in here the drain at the middle you know do this grab the right style do that okay so we have strange system in there if that's what they want stand elevation sheet we just put that done foundation's good roof framing that looks pretty good roof Shear looks we forgot lot decals so let's just follow two put decals here which is going to lead us into the detail Library here in a second just going to pull this rake again we had our own internal stuff so very Ry if you don't follow my n equation Meuse we know that you know I'm just going to say that that's a perforated sheer wall so let's just add that one in there rqu Earth and this is really simple so I'm not going to spend a bunch of time of labeling that for future reference I'm just going to do the detail sheets real quick so our plan set's basically done now on This Ti project we probably wouldn't provide one but we have been adding roof aing CLS and four nailing CLS in so that we know exactly where our Draft lines are and we have a lot of time on these custom bake homes we'll ask the pound director go scrap pain spray those lines so whether we decide to take the Drone out or we out there and get up on the roof very easily and safely like we can see very quickly where they put those lines and match that up to the roof U the roof framing the roof nailing plant right when apply the Drone break down with the nail space above all the paint of eyes to get just a representation of so there we go there's High our plan set so now that's add some details so we know we're on 2436 I I realized I did not talked about K lock get I'll get there I want to do it all at once I just passed that where over for6 okay so we typically start Foundation then you go connections and then we go Shear that's typically how we try to orient it doesn't always work out you'll find a detail after you've done most of the plan set oh sorry Foundation plan or Foundation detail is on the light sheet my that happens right so let's look at what we need at the foundation you know just based on here and I Me by you know just by looking at this cuz I've been doing it I'm ability my great BB tail I when I just pull down there we need you know slab with a sheer wall bot and that pretty much handles most of our you know Project Specific details so there's a couple ways to do this you can draw your details drop them in we can talk about the betail library which We R in just a second but then there's also the idea of using your own internal libraries on the detail sheet side that you've pre-built so here I know that I've got a foundation one so de connections for FL for foundation foundation so I made one this is just going to be a standard detail sheet that has everything Linked In where I want it and I can pick and choose who I want right okay I've got a lot of details in here that's these are all pretty standard I don't really have these steps in this detail it might set the footing all you corner I don't had any sheer walls or bearing walls of the interior interior I can get rid of that down in Napa we don't typically need to pin in a rock I don't that any F of CVS and I can now decide with a couple barrage details I'm just going to use this one for this project I don't have any exterior pedestals that goes away I can just come in and this is going to be sloppy it's okay and while I'm going to go ahead I'm going to save this file as my you know to the vs 2.1 my first detail sheet and then my detail numbers will match so s2.1 would start with 100s s 2.2 200 so on so far I'm not going to relabel these um but I'm just going to go to the the turn down slab we'll just call this that's 107 and now I've got this I can go back to Foundation Lo set for those who are not familiar with autoex I've got all this built in great beam G beam is what I called that one out as well seven those are all updated right this is the lad Shear at wall okay what is that call it model two though and know know we don't have any custom decals no custom decals no custom connection decals except this one which is just the Kinga decal which help call out technically we don't call out kick STS other than where hold down Jer because it's just just a typical dcount where hold down occurs if I lead it like this it's going to show up on site where going go what the heck is that so I will typically PA either two eyes of preb or those of per so for this I'm just going to drop in your 2 by say uh detail and I'm now I'm just going to label that as as a king stub and do back to that layer CU then the sheets done for [Music] now okay let's go up and let's do one more she or one more sheet give that fix that so I know I've got a couple Ro details in you here I need EES and rank so again let's just do that again do I have a sheet made for that and yes they do those trff peration roof uh I don't so I didn't actually PR for the presentation awesome so let's go here uh let's actually do a quick introduction to the detail library and be grab those details so we have an insal detail Library which we talked about in the last presentation they don't have a bunch time to go into it very Qui but feel free to find us afterwards CAU without a bar so this library is built in with our current company library is over 6,000 ready to go P details go into so I know for this project I'm looking at a roof e you tell that I KN so I'm a roof e uh I know it's a solid Raptor solid rafter right there I know it's perpendicular and it's I did it well already because it's trusses and not that so I'm with a truss Raptor perpendicular okay cool that's not quite the one I need but it's close we know that the trust is the stoping a wall so let's go ah and grab that along cuz it's as close as I have you know so let's grab that we're going to flip the hyper L which is going to open been L I'm going to copy that detail let's just put it in the other sheet for now there I'll save that for later just the second close this describe the rape detail we know about 11 minutes I know where we go fast and then Q&A nope all way back to roof rank roof rank I got a truss Rafer par not stopping at the wall I was that version open that one grab that paste vo okay good now we know that for this detail I need to alter this detail real quick so let's do that but this is going to be quick aside from the detail library because this exists in our detail Library remember when we save Sketcher models that are existing you want to be careful on if you're going to edit that model if it's referenced in other projects or other locations right as then it will update in all of those locations which we don't necessarily want find mod info so I'm going to go to our library then I know this is the library so I know the scene I'm going to copy my scene cut into our detail search which was a great addition copy that select all that copy it and off view Memory will come plug into just a second and view close scretch them up up it wants to pro top is working over time and he didn't know little core laptop it's going to die during the day no no no no no try okay I'm going to let it think for a second but we're not going to going actually PDF in this thing we don't how PDF of a layout and pre set we all use at leas the reasonable PF software by interview okay wait if you don't come talk to me up or talk where we go back to that plugin I use we toall view there or create the scene all with that we save this as just uh I'm going to sa it the desktop was just cust use oh de God love that serial color um custom use stop at wall right and call it there just go got to do this really really fast uh we're oh shique to do this oh no might be no you I love your just put this again sloppy detail but you get the idea we're doing this fast we can't see that one so that's good are also so as he's doing that everything you see on this on the screen all those pages of details that we've created all the the uh plan sheets everything we're we're willing to bundle all that and sell it um if we can get about people interested in doing it it's just the amount of time that takes him to bundle it put a ribbon on create all videos do a step-by-step process we're we're willing to just release that to public see we could and that was the B talked about from the beginning get the engineers to transfer over 3 four weeks we create this this plet okay this been retive we're running short but essentially that is how we filled the pl so I know it's very abbreviated but I kind of Te You the gist of the labelings you should just uh the detailing on this all as of just getting PDF we clean this up and make it look all pre change the views a little bit ASD Bond uh and from there it's going to end up with a set it's going to look let's go ahead and pull up a final set of a cool project um that's fine our six so this is one the gis is completed uh just finished the steel shop drawers and it's breaking ground pretty much as we speak uh so full set is going to look you know something like this feure wreaking yeah I will just going to fil roof problem here so full elevation gauge we can see how this could be very useful in the field we've only been doing this for about 6 months and people L it especially with color uh and what we have is uh with find good page some details on it what we do is we also hyperlink our pets to make them easy to use as everything starts move away from paper even in the field uh laptops iPads it starts to be much more efficient even for guys the field that's sit around trying to flip through cages so we said well I detail 3ave okay we can that in BDM sot for and we are doing a linking in the PDF software there's no good way that we have found yeah could do it internally especially if you're doing it through W documents which you kind of have to do with L app sometimes hang the size of your documents uh so we have that and do another one by 301 okay there we go and then back you're good what about products that they don't know about what about you get someone out there that doesn't know what a uh WS HRT is right that TS up to the shels right so we've got uh where hold have it in here somewhere oh no it's in the nose s right you move it to the nose or nose so if we go like a wswt you click that and it's going since site is not looking the Wi-Fi right now but it goes online and grabs that information so that in the field whether you know what that is or not you can open it go oh that's what he's talking about and immediate feedback says them calling an engineer who may already not be able to answer right they have immediate feedb that's a wait to simpsons's page and tell us yeah so as they St off it's right there and then the last thing we'll do is we do a set is we do provide full 3d PDFs on the on the cover of the pet which is our alternative KUB right now went under uh there's new stuff going in sketch up that will be very similar hopefully so we're waiting on that but we also do full paints rpds as necessary if they want specific areas um so what we can do here is that set goes out and then we can immediately start working on steel if they want to let us do the steel shot runs which we prefer because it's already built B it's accurate we can be that fast we've had two now in the last 3 months that have full steel sh packages in or as building permit is submitted before they permit they have full steel shops that I I assume you have full Library connections are there um some of them we typically had a library of plates that we build in on connections it's just part of our detailing most of the connections and then if you're know you might do this deal you probably just detail it into the model and then pull it out for a decal as opposed to doing it another way on stiffeners ears stuff like that I we pull in for all the different sizes we don't you draw those each time you over on the rain layers you show like a yeah that's what I was going to expect so if we come in so we started looking in F and this is kind of funky with the copes cuz we had such um thin numers but that's all built in the sketch up and the way we do seal uh we don't break out any these numbers all of these and all of this data is coming from the primary structural L it's one m and we do that we you could do it where you're bringing componds out referencing all the stuff but we found a c experience that stuff gets missed when you're going down to this level accuracy uh some of them make a change in the main model but not but they should have made it in the component model and then regr and that's just it makes it very difficult to check things and you know we go through two checks on every set before we go out two different Engineers review sets so that makes it much more contr resuming if you have to go to that level of dcount so you have setup SCS for just each yeah each U member is got a scene and so then each uh each steel member Group which has all the components NE studs in it is on its own layer so it gets a little bit bunky with the layering but if you plant it outright it's really cut down how many do you Ender P for steel well overall like I have oh just in general yeah depends on the model depends on the model but I mean like this one has a a fair mode because I had 70 steel numbers in it that we had to DET and each one of those is a layer each one is a layer but like if you use the I was a late adopter of the tag groups cuz I was very and I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this they'll mess with my system and then I started using it just for those kinds of purposes I started using the tags to get uh like structure two level structure one level structure zero level and then structure steel and when you do it that way you're not really using it uh just as overabundance like to change your overabundance of layers you're using it for a specific purpose it's not too bad right is in the in the view you're only going to see four or five years it's not too bad you know exactly where you're looking and so what do you have as a I'm sorry no here's mine go ahead what do you have as a as a uh know labeling convention for all of those helps I'll show you uh is there a seam group seam group does not exist yet right they working they're working does not currently exist yeah yeah like a fuller of seen yeah he's have to wait for the the layer C pulling not the right F your C did you guys just sit I speak it to just be like this is our old standard and this is how we're templating everything so ask that to open a that's really quickly external PLM do this very very fast the 3D text editor by tomon it's awesome if you do the 3D text and you want to edit that layer you have to Reiner more 3D text but with 3D text editor you that are his instead and it's just SP you can change it whatever you want enter up view Memory for the detailing that allows you to memorize a view or memorize scenes export those to another import a really good one Auto invisible layer can you anyone anyone yeah a couple Auto invisible layers um is apparently very similar to another plugin I wasn't aware of uh but that it when you insert a new layer it does not get added to all of your scenes that are already existing uh medik Trust uh we use just trust and I only use project because he moved the uh the cut and extend tools from trust to project other than that that's still to have them PF in quar we still use fairly often um that's Brock John in the back it's a great little piece of software for him I have more licenses than anyone that's ever bought that software because BS keep crashing and he has to keep giving more licenses um crop power Builder s really powerful I haven't cre before yet we use it for steel on still training it takes a lot to develop a system we hav't had a bunch of time but I am using it right now on steel all the steel you saw um you know all the steel you see on like the stuns that was all built with profile over to keep the spacing what I wanted uh what else do I have on there in simat exporter uh that's my soft uh simlab software that's what I use to generate all our 3dps kind of a little bit fky you used to say get used to it but it's as long as you generate your templates the same similar kind of way at their software it works out pretty well so we have a question about the naming prevention of tags here so what we've got is all of this J you see here this is all architectural stuff um I don't typically group those because then if they add a layer down the road and I case it's just a mess I leave their stuff alone but so for us it's always uh how many levels you have and then zeros of foundation and those all relate again like we talked earlier to the various stories of scripts right so like structure two I'm going to have my beams columns columns that are different varying uh continuing um any foundation that might hit to loans Raptor Shear then just various on and on and each of those occur at each level rather than grouping various ious things into a level and then tur your level on and off this gives me the ability to um alter things very quickly so if I look at I know I'm short I'm kind just boot me if you have to um go the scene so it allows me to run scripts that are oh I don't want to look at that layer anymore right or rers I don't need I don't need ply what or I don't need I don't those we could turn off grids it allows you do stuff like that as opposed to taking the mouse from here to your second screen turn these on and off or you know it's just a lot more control one two zero keyboard I was waiting for a while thank you okay so I'll just show you real quick I wrote scripts that essentially toggle group visibility or cable layer visibility so I know that if I one had the to really quickly see what's happening on architectural right but I don't want to spend time moving my mouse from here over here and then back I can just do this I can use a short R and then oh well I don't really need to see that upper level anymore see we go there is no stret for tree in this model oop my bad if I'm L I'm stretch for two know need fly wood good to go and that allows you to do that so our convention when you lift the steel it gets a little bit more on but you see how that works columns are all in column under the steel beam same kind of thing and then any ass any miscellaneous that's where we have our members the show wood Show steel uh we do in cimport our civil surface when we do the Civil design so this is what's actually going to be out there stop gotting that I know we're out of time you're out of time I apologize that was all I have that's the little thing websites um on here we have a store and a plan process the store talks about our detail stuff uh the plan process is a information grab if you're interested if we can get enough interest we will produce that process uh that's just a grabb your email address or contact information give you a little bit more info do check out the SketchUp blog we just did a good feature with them that talks about a lot of this stuff uh that is on there yeah for sure anyone no someone thought I saw here no where is the I was looking at the M earlier where is the J emails and you know show interest oh it's right here on the where these arrows are if you go to our website with Zachary engineering.com and you click on the like extend thing on the top right you'll get the drop downs here and it's just right there flip on the CL process and it'll call right up for you it's just a Google note or Google page you just goog website yes they can actually CU we do have that ability yeah we just go right up here and planning process it'll pull you right into the this form yeah if we can G get enough enough interest on those we will absolutely produce that it's just it's an awful lot of work um if we're not going to have people who are going to benefit from using it we think you will but that's totally up to you uh that's dot any additional questions come find me we'll be wandering the halls for around [Music]
