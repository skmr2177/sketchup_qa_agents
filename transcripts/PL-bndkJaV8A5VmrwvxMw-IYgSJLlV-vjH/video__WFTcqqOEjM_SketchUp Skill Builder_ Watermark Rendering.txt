Kind: captions Hey guys, this is Aaron. I have a cabin right here, a little log cabin I built. And I want a way to visualize this in a little more realistic setting without having to use a third party renderer. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to look at some options with my Styles, specifically with watermarks. Here in my Styles window I'm going to click on the second to last tab which is watermarks. Once in here, I'm going to hit plus to add a new watermark. Watermark is going to let me choose any image file I want, so I'm going to grab this meadow image. I'm going to go ahead and pick on that and click open. And it's going to show me, it's going to start by calling it watermark 1, I'm going to call it my Meadow. And I'm going to say I want it as a background. I'm going to click next. And I have the option here of selecting how much I want that to bleed through. I actually want that at 100%. I want the image just as bright and shiny as it is by itself. I'm going to hit on next. And I have some options on where I want to place it. So stretch to fit the entire window is where it's at now. Tiled, obviously, is not going to work for me very well. Positioned in the window is what I'm actually going to shoot for because I want this to fill the entire screen. So I'm going to put it there, choose my anchor point, which is the center, and I'm going to slide the scale all the way up. So it's going to fill my screen left to right. And hit Finish. Alright so now my cabin is floating around inside that image, so as I orbit or pan, move around, I'm actually moving it like it's in the image. So I'm going to put this back here where it would look good. That looks about right. Maybe right there. So now what I can do - it looks okay. I mean this looks pretty good, this is a good start, but I want to make it look at little more realistic so I'm going to do a little more work with my Style. I'm going to come here to lines, and I'm going to turn edges off. So now getting a little closer. In real life I don't have edges on things. Getting there. Looks pretty good. The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to turn on Shadows. So here's my Shadow window, I'm going to go ahead and click on the shadow icon. And this doesn't look like much to start out with. I'm going to have to do a little bit of fine tuning. One thing I want to do is, the shadow's here on the left side, but I can see my shadows on everything over here are kind of falling to the right. So I'm going to mess with my daytime until I get it to come over to the right a little bit more. There we go that looks like it's a little closer. The other thing I'm going to do is change my light and dark. What I've found from experimenting is if I turn my light just about all the way up, or maybe all the way up, and turn my dark down, I get a little more realistic render, or shadow like that. As far as my lights and darks are concerned. So I'm going to turn that a little bit more, maybe push it back a little. And I can make it look like it's actually sitting in that drawing. So that's about it. Pretty simple. Easy way to get a semi-realistic image out of SketchUp using just Styles and watermarks. Thank you!
