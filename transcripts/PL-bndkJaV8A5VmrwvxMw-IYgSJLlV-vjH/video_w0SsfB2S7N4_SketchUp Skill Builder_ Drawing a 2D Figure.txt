Kind: captions Hey guys, this is Aaron. I am in the process of recreating my face me component, and I've got my reference image here. The next step is to start putting geometry on here. I'll zoom in. Woah, that's too much me for me! I'm going to draw some lines, and I'll trace around a portion of my image that I want to make into a surface. I'll start with the hair. Every couple inches I'll click to place a line. It doesn't have to be exact. As I try to draw my head it snaps to straight down. The further out I am the harder the SketchUp inferencing will try to pull towards an axis. If i want to go just off axis I zoom in a little and it'll let me. I'll continue here. Just clicking around. Right here I clicked off plane. If I spin sideways, it came out like that. It's important to watch my cursor. I want to look at the color of the dot beneath the pencil. It's purple now. Purple means it's on the face of the image. Be careful that the dot stays purple. I'm going to click here and , hopefully, close that surface. I'm going to have a hard time speaking. I'll delete that surface and draw another shape. If I click and draw a line over one of the edges it'll regenerate that surface. I'll pick up where the last surface left off and start tracing around. I don't have to have just edge pieces. I can put in a detail for my ear. The idea is not to be exact, but enough lines that it gives you the shape you're looking for. Right here, this should be a closed shape, but no surface came up. Couple things I want to look at here. 1. Spin it sideways to make sure there are no lines shooting off axis like I had before. Nope, looks good. Now I can encourage it to find those shapes by drawing some internal lines. That was an easy one. I drew one line and it found the geometry. Everything was good. I'll close up the rest of the face. Boom! Closed. I'll add a detail or two. Some of the surfaces are backwards and I want to correct that. I'll click on those surfaces, right click, and Reverse Faces. Next step is to click around and get all the faces closed in. Watch how fast this happens. Okay, now that I have those lines in there, the surfaces were created. I can move this image out of the way, and add color. I can use the eyedropper to add colors from the original photo, and the Paint Bucket tool to fill in each surface. Now that my face me is drawn, all I have to do is make a component, and make it always face the camera. That's it for this Skill Builder. Thank you!
