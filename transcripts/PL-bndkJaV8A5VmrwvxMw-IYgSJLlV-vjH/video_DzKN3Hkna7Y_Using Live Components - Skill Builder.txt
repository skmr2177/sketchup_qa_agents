Kind: captions Hey guys, it's Aaron. We've been looking&nbsp; at live components recently, they're the... &nbsp; as of right now, as of this recording,&nbsp; the new release from Sketchup labs. And I just thought it would be&nbsp; cool to look a little bit into how&nbsp;&nbsp; live components behave once you actually get&nbsp; them into a model because they are components,&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of, so they kind of work the way components&nbsp; do but not completely, so that's why I figure we&nbsp;&nbsp; should take a look at it. If it's that hard to&nbsp; describe exactly what it is then it's worth a&nbsp;&nbsp; video right? So, let's take a look at using live components inside your model right now. All right, so I have a model and I got two things in here,&nbsp; I got Sumele and I have a live component that I&nbsp;&nbsp; downloaded. So, the first thing I want to look at&nbsp; before I even I mean, well here let me prove to&nbsp;&nbsp; you what this is because one thing you should&nbsp; keep an eye on is if I click on Sumele over&nbsp;&nbsp; here it tells me in my entity info that this is&nbsp; currently a component. This one right here if I&nbsp;&nbsp; click on the toilet it does tell me it is a live&nbsp; component and what the name of the definition is.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't already do it, I do recommend keeping&nbsp; entity info open. It it will, it flickers a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit, it will resize based on the thing you have&nbsp; picked, but man so much good information in there:&nbsp;&nbsp; names, definitions, that kind of thing that is worth keeping open. As well as the&nbsp;&nbsp; configure button, see right there I can actually configure this. So, here's the first thing about&nbsp;&nbsp; live components: live components cannot be scaled using the scale tool. Let me show you what&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean by that. Well, you probably already figure&nbsp; this out, if I hit scale and I hover over Sumele&nbsp;&nbsp; I can click on her, I get the handles, I can make her whatever size I want. Live components,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I come over here and lets you know let's&nbsp; let's get off of Sumele and then I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to hit this. When I hover over the toilet, see a&nbsp; little "no" comes up, a little anti-symbol.&nbsp;&nbsp; No scaling this component, so I can click as many&nbsp; times I want, it's not going to work. If I try&nbsp;&nbsp; pre-selecting and then hitting scale, it's just&nbsp; going to deselect it. I can't use a traditional&nbsp;&nbsp; scaling method. Now, that is intentional of&nbsp; course, because what I want to be able to do is&nbsp;&nbsp; right click configure live component, the&nbsp; configuration menu is going to pop up and I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to use those tools to reconfigure, rather&nbsp; than using the standard, like scale tool. Now&nbsp;&nbsp; having said, that if i take this component and&nbsp; I stick it inside of a group for example, so,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to draw a little line here, I'm going to select both of those. I'm going to right-click&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm going to make those into a group. I can&nbsp; come in with scale now and scale those together. &nbsp; So that bigger container is being scaled. The cool&nbsp; thing is that internally if I come into this group, this is still a live component, that I can&nbsp; still, configure using my configuration menu,&nbsp;&nbsp; just like it was before. But, by putting it inside&nbsp; that container and scaling it, I’ve made a larger&nbsp;&nbsp; version with the same information. So, just a&nbsp; way around it, if you do have a live component&nbsp;&nbsp; that looks good, but the only thing you have&nbsp; to do is you need to change the size of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; just throw it in a group and you'll be able to do that. Okay, so get rid of that line. All right the&nbsp;&nbsp; other thing is, or the next thing, not other,&nbsp; there’s a couple things we got going still.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is if I make a copy, even though this is called a&nbsp; live component, rather than a standard component,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is still a component. So, if I look&nbsp; at the definition of these two pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp; the definition is the same: they're both called the toilet. And, if I select one of them and I bring&nbsp;&nbsp; up my live component configuration menu and make&nbsp; a change, so say for example I want to push the&nbsp;&nbsp; cistern up high or something like that, I'm gonna go ahead and change that. And look, both of them&nbsp;&nbsp; are going to change when I do that, because&nbsp; they're components and because they are connected.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I want to make this one separate from this&nbsp; one, I do have to right click on it, and I&nbsp;&nbsp; have to hit make unique. Making it unique doesn't&nbsp; change the fact that it's still a live component,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it does separate the tie between these&nbsp; two, sever the tie between these two. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I load the configuration menu now, after I’ve&nbsp; hit make unique on the second one, I can edit this&nbsp;&nbsp; using the same configuration, so I can&nbsp; bring that right back down to zero.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't change that other one though so, make&nbsp; unique, actually, keeps the live component, but&nbsp;&nbsp; makes it its own. Okay, so next thing I want&nbsp; to look at is I'm going to make another copy&nbsp;&nbsp; over here, I'm going to, again, make this one&nbsp; unique and I'm going to right-click and say&nbsp;&nbsp; detach definition. By detaching definition, I've&nbsp; severed the tie that everything that makes this&nbsp;&nbsp; a live component is not in this. So, if I click&nbsp; on this one right here, still a live component&nbsp;&nbsp; still have the configure button, right here, now it's just a component, no configure button. It is&nbsp;&nbsp; a component. So, if I was to copy this over here&nbsp; and then you know, double click, come in here,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I don't know, maybe I’ll if I raise the lid or&nbsp; something like that, see the copy does it too. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it is working like a regular component, but it&nbsp; doesn't have that live component piece anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here we have our original live component,&nbsp; here we have a unique live component,&nbsp;&nbsp; here we have it broken down into just&nbsp; a component. Let's go one step further,&nbsp;&nbsp; so these are, if you look at this, as I click&nbsp; between these two, these are the same definition,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I'm going to grab this one and again, a fourth,&nbsp; or a third time make unique, and once I do that,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can actually come in here and I can start&nbsp; exploding. So, as I explode, there we go, you can&nbsp;&nbsp; see now; I have each of my separate pieces, so I&nbsp; could do whatever I want with this thing now. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I wanted to do something like take this&nbsp; lid and raise it up and then grab this piece&nbsp;&nbsp; and scale that up to the bottom of that, I could do that. I could take my lid here and I could&nbsp;&nbsp; you know flip that partially open and then&nbsp; grab this piece and do the same thing here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, at this point, you know, the toilet is my oyster. I can do whatever I want with this&nbsp;&nbsp; because now it's just a regular SketchUp model.&nbsp; So just a real quick review; here, we have a live&nbsp;&nbsp; component; here we have a unique live component,&nbsp; separate from the beginning, the first one; here we have a unique component because we broke&nbsp; it apart from here; and, over here we actually&nbsp;&nbsp; have a collection of groups, totally broken&nbsp; apart from any componentization of any kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; So those are the things I think about when I think&nbsp; about using a live component inside of a model.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like I said live components are awesome, they are&nbsp; amazing, the ability to configure that geometry,&nbsp;&nbsp; super cool, love the sliders, and&nbsp; the text being I’ll put in there, but&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not always exactly what you want, and&nbsp; there are changes you might have to make&nbsp;&nbsp; and these are the kinds of things you're going&nbsp; to think about when you get to that point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you like that video?
