Hey guys, this is Aaron. I want to take a
look today at installing extensions. There's

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.160 position:63% line:0%
a couple of different ways to get extensions
installed in SketchUp. The first one we will

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.770 position:63% line:0%
look at is via the Extension Warehouse. If
I click on the Extension Warehouse button

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.481 position:63% line:0%
or go to window, Extension Warehouse, it will
pull up this browser window of the Extension

00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:36.500 position:63% line:0%
Warehouse. Now, from here you can use the
search box or the extension list or filters

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.030 position:63% line:0%
to find the extension you want. In my case
I am going to go find one of the ThomThom

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.600 position:63% line:0%
extensions. And I'm going to scroll down.
What I'm looking for is Groups to Components.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.910 position:63% line:0%
Now the first thing you want to make sure
you are doing is logging into Extension Warehouse.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.649 position:63% line:0%
There are a couple of reasons you want to
do this. One is if you download it, the extension

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.350 position:63% line:0%
you download will go into your "My Extensions"
list so in future versions, or if you install

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.420 position:63% line:0%
into a new computer, it's really easy to just
go to "My Extensions" and install all of your

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.830 position:63% line:0%
extensions at once. The other reason I would
do this is because instead of download I will

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.220 position:63% line:0%
actually get the install button. To install
this Groups to Components extension, all I

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.869 position:63% line:0%
have to do is click the install button. It's
going to come up and prompt me reminding me

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.259 position:63% line:0%
that I am giving this program some rights
on my computer. Do you want to install? I'm

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.910 position:63% line:0%
going to hit yes, and I'm done. Okay, so if
I come out here now, I'll find that if I go

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.229 position:63% line:0%
to extension, I have the option of Convert
Groups to Components. That extension is now

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.030 position:63% line:0%
installed. Now, when it comes to maintaining
those installed extensions, I can click this

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.380 position:63% line:0%
button right here to get my extension manager
up. The extension manager is going to give

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.860 position:63% line:0%
you a list of all the extensions that are
installed in this copy of SketchUp, including

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.479 position:63% line:0%
the one I just installed right here - Groups
to Components. Now, if I want to, from this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.750 position:63% line:0%
screen, I can actually disable individual
extensions. So, if I don't want to see Groups

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.340 position:63% line:0%
to Components I can temporarily, without uninstalling
it, disable it by clicking the enable/disable

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.700 position:63% line:0%
switch and hitting apply changes. If I want
to permanently disable or remove, I can uninstall

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.780 position:63% line:0%
by using the manage tab. The other thing that
is nice about the manage tab is if you have

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.810 position:63% line:0%
an update to one of your extensions, you will
actually have the ability to click the update

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.110 position:63% line:0%
button and update that. Now the update button
is only going to show up for extensions that

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.310 position:63% line:0%
are installed through the Extension Warehouse.
Speaking of which, if I wanted to install

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.361 position:63% line:0%
an extension that I didn't find in the Extension
Warehouse, I can do that through the extension

00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:52.480 position:63% line:0%
manager by clicking install extension, navigating
to where that RBZ file is. in this case I

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.450 position:63% line:0%
have Eneroth's Camera Memory. I'm going to
click on that. I'm going to hit open, and,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.000 position:63% line:0%
with that, it is installed. So I have that
right here. Again, easy to install, and at

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.800 position:63% line:0%
this point it is just like an extension that
was installed through the warehouse, except

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.660 position:63% line:0%
that it won't be available for updates. So,
there you go! That is how you go about installing

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.810 position:63% line:0%
and managing your extensions inside of SketchUp.
Thank you.
