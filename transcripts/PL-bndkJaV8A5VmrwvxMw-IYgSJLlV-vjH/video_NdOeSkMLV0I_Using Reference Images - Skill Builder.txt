Kind: captions Hey guys it's Aaron, I want to look at something&nbsp; today that I think I do a lot of during live&nbsp;&nbsp; models and some of my other modeling videos,&nbsp; but I maybe haven't touched on in a while. How,&nbsp;&nbsp; why, what it is I'm doing, and that is, I just&nbsp; wanted to do a quick refresher on working with&nbsp;&nbsp; reference imagery. So the idea here is I'm not&nbsp; going to go into photo match, this isn't matching&nbsp;&nbsp; photos, this is not using the depth, setting&nbsp; the axis on a photo to match it in 3d space,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is more about just having an image that&nbsp; I want to use as a reference. So there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; couple ways I'm gonna talk about loading that&nbsp; in, we'll take a look at those right now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so, in a recent live video we modeled a&nbsp; boat and I had some reference images, so one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the options you can do with reference images of&nbsp; course it's simple is, if you have the setup to do&nbsp;&nbsp; it is open SketchUp and then also open these other&nbsp; images. So, if I was to do something like this,&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously this doesn't work great in my setup.&nbsp; I'm modeling just on my laptop screen here so&nbsp;&nbsp; losing half my screen to an image and a plan&nbsp; is not ideal. This works real well of course&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have multiple monitors which it&nbsp; seems like a lot of people do nowadays,&nbsp;&nbsp; I could actually have this open over on&nbsp; the other monitor maybe blown up real&nbsp;&nbsp; big and this next to it, where I could just&nbsp; kind of turn my head and look at the images&nbsp;&nbsp; that sort of thing, that works really well.&nbsp; But, if I'm in a situation like I currently am,&nbsp;&nbsp; losing half my screen to reference images is not&nbsp; really an option. So, now I have to look at some&nbsp;&nbsp; different ways to import those reference images&nbsp; to use them. So, you can see there I actually have&nbsp;&nbsp; two different types of images, one is actually&nbsp; a picture of the boat I'm trying to model,&nbsp;&nbsp; the other is a set of plans. So, how I would&nbsp; want to import these, would be different&nbsp;&nbsp; based on the type of image, so let's look at two&nbsp; different ways I would import these reference&nbsp;&nbsp; images. The first one is pretty straightforward.&nbsp; I'm going to go to file. I'm going to say import&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm going to grab that plan, and I'm going&nbsp; to import it as an image. I'm going to go ahead&nbsp;&nbsp; and import it and I'm just going to slap it on the&nbsp; ground and I'm going to blow it up nice and big,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I can reference it. So, right now as&nbsp; I look at it I'm looking down from above&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is pretty much how I would import&nbsp; this. So, this is gonna let me come in here&nbsp;&nbsp; and you know trace details off of this to&nbsp; use one note might be to take a look at this&nbsp;&nbsp; and possibly scale or possibly straighten.&nbsp; So, what do I mean by straightening? Let's&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about that. So, right here I have a line&nbsp; going right down the middle, you can see that&nbsp;&nbsp; down the middle of the boat, if I come to one end&nbsp; and I click on it and then I come along the other&nbsp;&nbsp; end, so my red axis should be straight down the&nbsp; middle, but you can see it's just slightly off,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if I look back here you can see it actually&nbsp; starts off on the center line and then by the&nbsp;&nbsp; time it gets to the length of the boat it's off&nbsp; a little bit. So, what I would do in this case&nbsp;&nbsp; is, I would draw a line on that center line&nbsp; because it's easier to have a line to snap to,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to do a group select to select&nbsp; both the image and the centerline,&nbsp;&nbsp; then I'm going to go to rotate, click at one end,&nbsp;&nbsp; and click at the other end, now I'm going to drag&nbsp; that end down until it snaps onto the red axis,&nbsp;&nbsp; that way as I come in here I draw a line like&nbsp; this, look at that now, it's perfectly straight,&nbsp;&nbsp; perfectly aligned so any lines that are supposed&nbsp; to align to straight now, I'm actually be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; snap straight along there. The second idea is to&nbsp; scale it, so if I have a known quantity, if I know&nbsp;&nbsp; how long this boat is from this point to this&nbsp; point, what I can do is, I can draw that line,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can grab my tape measure and click one end to&nbsp; the other end, and then type in the length it's&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to be. So, this is a 42-foot ship, I can&nbsp; type 42 foot, enter, do you want to scale, yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; and now this is to scale, so that is a good tool&nbsp; to have, that's a good way to get that image in.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I was tracing shapes off of here that&nbsp; I want to use, that would be the way to do&nbsp;&nbsp; it. My reference image, on the other hand,&nbsp; remember this picture I have right here,&nbsp;&nbsp; this reference image, I don't know that I would&nbsp; want to pull it in and throw it on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is good because I can trace actual geometry&nbsp; off of this plan with a reference image like that,&nbsp;&nbsp; I more want to see the details and then hop in&nbsp; and try to copy or replicate them in my model,&nbsp;&nbsp; so the way that I would import that would probably&nbsp; be different. What I would go about doing with&nbsp;&nbsp; the solution that I've come up with lately&nbsp; especially, is to go into my styles,&nbsp;&nbsp; click edit on my current style, and then click&nbsp; this fourth tab right here which is my watermark,&nbsp;&nbsp; and load that image in as a watermark. So,&nbsp; I'll go ahead and grab that image hit open&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's going to start by plopping it right in&nbsp; the middle like this, I can overlay it, an overlay&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to be if I wanted to like show up in&nbsp; front of my model which I don't really want I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to be in the background, so I click on background&nbsp; that puts my image in the back. It's huge... this&nbsp;&nbsp; is like wallpaper on your computer huge, so I'm&nbsp; going to click next here, I can fade it out a&nbsp;&nbsp; little if I want to, I'd find that I'd start to&nbsp; lose detail if I faded out so I generally leave&nbsp;&nbsp; it complete on an image, and then what I'll do is&nbsp; hit position, rather than tiling or stretching and&nbsp;&nbsp; then I'll stick it in the corner, so stick in the&nbsp; top left or lower right corner, and I'll scale it&nbsp;&nbsp; so it's small, it gets small enough that I can&nbsp; still see the detail I want to get out of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's not going to like crowd me, you know?&nbsp; So I'm going to crowd my modeling screen,&nbsp;&nbsp; what that lets me do because I put it in the&nbsp; background it means if I work on something big,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not going to get in my way, but if I want&nbsp; to come out like this I don't need another screen&nbsp;&nbsp; to glance up and see this picture, it's kind&nbsp; of like I printed the picture out and just set&nbsp;&nbsp; it here on my screen, and I don't lose any real&nbsp; estate by putting in the back to have it there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, there we go there's a couple ways you can get&nbsp; reference imagery into SketchUp on a single screen&nbsp;&nbsp; using import image and watermark. Like I said,&nbsp; that was something that I just kept doing over&nbsp;&nbsp; and over on our live models and I think I did it&nbsp; in a couple of skill builder videos and I'm like&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know that I've actually touched on what,&nbsp; why, when I do those things. So, it does depend&nbsp;&nbsp; on the piece you have if you're working off of&nbsp; a scaled piece of content something like a plan,&nbsp;&nbsp; “like a plan”, then you may want to import it and&nbsp; scale it and have it on the ground to reference.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's just something you want to glance up&nbsp; occasionally, having a second monitor is great,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean I'm not saying don't take advantage,&nbsp; I have a second monitor over there and if I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; modeling something and I want to see the image,&nbsp; I put it over there on the second monitor, but if&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm traveling if I'm away from my second monitor&nbsp; or something like that, you can use a watermark&nbsp;&nbsp; to pull that image in and still reference it&nbsp; without actually eating up your modeling space.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like that video if so click like down&nbsp; below, and if you haven't already, please&nbsp;&nbsp; subscribe!
