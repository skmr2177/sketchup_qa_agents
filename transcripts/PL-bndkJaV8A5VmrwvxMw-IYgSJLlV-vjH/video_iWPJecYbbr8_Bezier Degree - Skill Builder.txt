Kind: captions Hey guys, it's Aaron! Last week, we did a video&nbsp;&nbsp; on drawing filigree and we talked a lot about the&nbsp; bezier curve extension from SketchUp. So, it's kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of an extension, kind of native tool, it's kind of&nbsp; somewhere in between, it's from the SketchUp team.&nbsp; We just used it in its most basic&nbsp; method, which is just a couple of clicks&nbsp;&nbsp; and two points to define an arc.&nbsp; Real good for creating you know&nbsp;&nbsp; half circle-y shapes that aren't perfectly a chunk&nbsp; of a circle, like you would with the arc command.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when you start bezier curve, there's this&nbsp; thing called degree down in the lower-left corner,&nbsp;&nbsp; the lower-right corner, excuse me, and I&nbsp; just want to dive into what that is. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; last week we had a long workflow video, this week&nbsp; gives me a little more focus on just how that one&nbsp;&nbsp; piece of the command works, so without any further&nbsp; ado let's talk about bezier curve and degree. Okay, so I have just... I have these&nbsp; lines, just to use as a reference&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just a bunch of gray lines in a&nbsp; group so I can't, I can you know, I can&nbsp;&nbsp; use these as reference but I'm not going to&nbsp; actually create any geometry. I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp; come in here to draw click bezier curves, when I&nbsp; first click bezier curve, you see down low right,&nbsp;&nbsp; it says degree 3. I don't know what degree means&nbsp; specifically, how that term came up, but what that&nbsp;&nbsp; means is once I pick the start point, I'm going&nbsp; to click three more points to define the curve.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here let's just walk right through, right now,&nbsp; so I'm gonna start, this is click number zero,&nbsp;&nbsp; now I'm gonna click three times to find this curve. One, to define the end; two, is going to define the curve coming off of the start point. So, this is why I have this grid here&nbsp;&nbsp; to use as the same; and then click number three is&nbsp; the line to define the curve off of the endpoint&nbsp;&nbsp; and click right here. So, this is what that degree&nbsp; changes, it's how many clicks you have to define&nbsp;&nbsp; this curve. So, no matter what I draw, no matter&nbsp; how big or small or how many curves, this is&nbsp;&nbsp; always going to be a 20 segment line. That's what bezier curve does, 20 segments. But, changing that&nbsp;&nbsp; degree lets you change how many control points&nbsp; basically you use when you create this. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; let me show you something just a way to make a&nbsp; minor adjustment. I'm going to bump that degree up&nbsp;&nbsp; by one, so I'm going to go to draw bezier curves,&nbsp; before I click anything, I'm going to type in&nbsp;&nbsp; 4 and now I'm going to come in and click my&nbsp; point 0 and I'm going to click my end for 1&nbsp;&nbsp; and now it's going to say same thing curve coming&nbsp; off here for two, now look at the second point,&nbsp;&nbsp; now I'm connected to both. So, I'm going to come&nbsp; right here to the middle of this point and snap, and now I'm going to come down here and&nbsp; snap for number four. So, you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp; it seems like that would give you the same thing&nbsp; but by putting that middle control point in there&nbsp;&nbsp; it actually gave this curve and this curve a&nbsp; second point to kind of pivot and stretch off&nbsp;&nbsp; of. So, it looked like it would give you something&nbsp; very similar because this point actually crosses&nbsp;&nbsp; right at the middle line, so does this but you&nbsp; can see that the curve balloons up a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; because you had that extra control point here.&nbsp; All right, let's take that just a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; further even. Let's come in here and draw bezier&nbsp; curve and this time I'm going to bump it up to&nbsp;&nbsp; five. All right so I'm going to click number zero,&nbsp; one then go back to the beginning two, three,&nbsp;&nbsp; four, five. So, look at that look how much that&nbsp; drastically changed that curve from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again all three of these, if I was to&nbsp; draw one line right across the middle&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see that every single one of them&nbsp; intersects at the middle of that line, each one,&nbsp;&nbsp; but because of the number of control points&nbsp; the number of points that pull at that line,&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a drastically different curve on each one&nbsp; of these, and that's just by changing that degree&nbsp;&nbsp; value when I go in to define the lines,&nbsp; the points that create that bezier curve. Okay, so like I said this was a brief one,&nbsp; this is longer what we could do in a quick win,&nbsp;&nbsp; to show it at that detail and then hopefully help&nbsp; you understand how that works, but I felt like I&nbsp;&nbsp; still had to cover because it was actually kind&nbsp; of like an aha moment when I went in and started&nbsp;&nbsp; playing with that I'm like, oh that's pretty&nbsp; cool. I've used the bezier command for years&nbsp;&nbsp; and always limited myself to three clicks and&nbsp; now I know that I can get a lot more control&nbsp;&nbsp; in defining those arcs just by increasing&nbsp; that degree, giving me more points to click,&nbsp;&nbsp; to create that kind of curve.&nbsp; So, hopefully, you like that,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you did like it, click down below, and if&nbsp; you haven't already, click on subscribe as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; We create several videos a week around here and&nbsp; you'll be notified of each and every one of them&nbsp;&nbsp; if you subscribe.
