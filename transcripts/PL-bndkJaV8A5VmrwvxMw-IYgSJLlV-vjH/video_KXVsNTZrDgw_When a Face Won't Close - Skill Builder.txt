Kind: captions Hey guys, it's Aaron. So, I saw, well I’ve seen&nbsp; lots of questions about this particular thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you do when you have a bunch of lines and&nbsp; you go to connect them but a face doesn't show up.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I started kind of exploring the&nbsp; different problems that can cause&nbsp;&nbsp; this and I think I came up with&nbsp; six that were fairly realistic. Everything else I could come up with was a&nbsp; variant of one of these six ways that a set&nbsp;&nbsp; of geometry won't close. So, let's go ahead&nbsp; and hop in and take a look at what those are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, so you'll notice I said six but there's seven&nbsp; sets of lines here, well that's because we're&nbsp;&nbsp; gonna show you what should happen of course. So, if&nbsp; I come over here, I have three lines one two three&nbsp;&nbsp; and I draw a line connecting these two&nbsp; ends right here everything happens to be&nbsp;&nbsp; an axis that shouldn't be, that should have&nbsp; no bearing on what we're actually doing but&nbsp;&nbsp; when I connect the two points a face shows up. That's normal; that's what should happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; All right, so let's look at the first example here, I’m going to go ahead and click, click... Oh!&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not close. So, I would say one of&nbsp; the more common reasons this happened is because&nbsp;&nbsp; a face shows up when a set of lines closes. So, anytime you have a situation where&nbsp;&nbsp; you have those lines and they don't close, there's a chance that there's a gap in lines.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, generally speaking, if you kind of spin&nbsp; around and take a look at the corners, it seems&nbsp;&nbsp; like depending on your model, depending what you're&nbsp; working on, you may have a situation where you have&nbsp;&nbsp; a corner that doesn't quite close. So if I, oh,&nbsp; look at this see this little, tiny gap right here that happens and it prevents your rectangle from&nbsp; closing so I obviously I took the quick way out&nbsp;&nbsp; and I just connected the two points. You probably&nbsp; want to figure out how it's supposed to close if&nbsp;&nbsp; that's you know, this is not actually a rectangle anymore. But anytime you have a set of lines and&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't close, it will not create a face. There is no rounding. There is no guessing. SketchUp&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't go oh these points are close enough let's&nbsp; just well it does do that but it's very very&nbsp;&nbsp; small. In this case, if your points are snapped to&nbsp; different points right here, they don't connect&nbsp;&nbsp; together, it doesn't close, it doesn't count.&nbsp; So, over here we'll go ahead and close this one&nbsp;&nbsp; and oh same thing, that's going to be recurring&nbsp; thing of course, they're not going to close.&nbsp;&nbsp; The issue with this one is a little easier to&nbsp; see, right here, I have geometry coming in now&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a thing that SketchUp does, to create a&nbsp; face, you have to have closed geometry. You can't&nbsp;&nbsp; have any loose geometry coming into the plane&nbsp; because it doesn't create a closed rectangle,&nbsp;&nbsp; so this was a closed shape, this one right here,&nbsp; if it followed lines around it has a line that&nbsp;&nbsp; comes in and doesn't go back out, it doesn't close&nbsp; and this is not actually a closed shape, so as&nbsp;&nbsp; long as there's any lines coming into the geometry&nbsp; this is going to be an issue. So, if I get rid&nbsp;&nbsp; of that line I just created, I’ll just get rid of this little line right here. Now, if I draw a line&nbsp;&nbsp; oh, we're good that one closes okay keep on moving&nbsp; our way down here. I’m going to draw another line&nbsp;&nbsp; here to here, uh oh, again doesn't close, what's&nbsp; going on? Well, one of the things you can do,&nbsp;&nbsp; a way that you can go and check for that loose&nbsp; geometry that I showed before, is to do a group&nbsp;&nbsp; select so if I come in here and do a group select&nbsp; like this, if there's loose geometry, it'll show up&nbsp;&nbsp; here in entity info. Whoa, four edges, well that&nbsp; could be an issue, I should only have three here,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I can't seem to find it, right? One, two,&nbsp; three, oh it's broken, what's going on? Okay, well&nbsp;&nbsp; here's the issue, again I have geometry coming in but I can't see it. Something's going on because&nbsp;&nbsp; this edge is broken, but I can't tell what it is.&nbsp; If you come up to view and turn hidden geometry,&nbsp; this can cause issues. So, if you're working on a&nbsp; model that you've worked and reworked in the past,&nbsp;&nbsp; you might have something like this with hidden&nbsp; yelps if you've smoothed geometry over and then&nbsp;&nbsp; you've deleted geometry and drawn over that geometry, you may have hidden lines. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of times people go, I got this wall and I can't&nbsp; close it up and when you go turn hidden geometry,&nbsp;&nbsp; looks like a spider web because there's&nbsp; so much stuff's been moved around. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp; just like with that little geometry in the corner, this won't close no matter what I do as long as&nbsp;&nbsp; this line's in here, even though it's hidden.&nbsp; So, if I turn on hidden geometry, delete that,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then draw that, then we close. All right,&nbsp; moving our way down, here's another one I’m&nbsp;&nbsp; going to draw that line and of course it's not&nbsp; going to close, what's going on here? All right,&nbsp;&nbsp; well this example is a little trickier because&nbsp; if I do a select, oops select just those pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp; turn that off, I do have just the three edges, that's all correct. The issue&nbsp; here, if I start moving around 3D space, look at&nbsp;&nbsp; that, see how it's just slightly out of plane?&nbsp; This causes problems for people all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, it is so teeny tiny that&nbsp; it's out of plane, it's hard to find.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way that you usually find an out of plane&nbsp; space like this is to do a little stitching. If I&nbsp;&nbsp; connect corner to corner, it closes, but if I&nbsp; delete that, it goes away again. That's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; an indicator that I have a problem with something&nbsp; being out of plane. You can check your points&nbsp;&nbsp; like this, so this, here's the x y and z&nbsp; location of this point. If I check every corner, oh, I can see right there, this corner is an&nbsp; inch and a quarter higher than the rest of&nbsp;&nbsp; these corners. So, what I’d want to do, is in this&nbsp; particular case, I’d probably use move to grab this&nbsp;&nbsp; point and move it vertically to the same height&nbsp; as this. Then when I draw that last line on,&nbsp;&nbsp; it closes up. That didn't update, get out of there.&nbsp; So that's the thing to look for also. All right,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're getting there, we're almost there! I’ll&nbsp; draw another line right here and surprise,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not going to close. We still have hidden geometry on so that's not the problem. If I select&nbsp;&nbsp; here, five edges again, that's weird, what's&nbsp; going on there oh, I got another broken line. That's usually an indicator like I said that&nbsp; something could be going on. In this case, if&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to tags and I have this hidden tag... oh look at&nbsp; that, I had a line on a hidden tag. So just because&nbsp;&nbsp; you can't see geometry doesn't mean it's not&nbsp; still interfering with what you're trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; If something's not acting the way it's&nbsp; supposed to, check hidden geometry,&nbsp;&nbsp; that doesn't work, check hidden tags, so&nbsp; again I’m just going to delete that line,&nbsp;&nbsp; draw right over top of this and it closes.&nbsp; All right, one last one here, I’m going to&nbsp;&nbsp; go ahead and connect these two points on and... surprise it doesn't work. What's the deal? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; if I click here, you'll notice that wait I&nbsp; click one line looks like it all lights up. There's a flickering line down here. If I look up here, it says it's a group. Well, that'll do it&nbsp;&nbsp; right? So this right here, if I double click, this&nbsp; is a group that those four lines are in. No matter&nbsp;&nbsp; what I do on the outside here, I am never going to&nbsp; get this to close, turning on hidden tags, nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to fix this because I can't interact&nbsp; with geometry inside of a container. So, I have&nbsp;&nbsp; to do one of two things: one is to right click&nbsp; and explode to get it out, or if I want to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; it separate just double click to enter the group&nbsp; and then draw my line there and then it closes. So, like I said, there are some other&nbsp; situations I could think of where you&nbsp;&nbsp; have geometry that doesn't quite&nbsp; close up when you wanted to, but&nbsp;&nbsp; all of those other situations were kind&nbsp; of variants or slight changes to this.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were all the situations I could think of,&nbsp; unique situations, I know the hidden line versus&nbsp;&nbsp; hidden tag was similar, but it could be lumped&nbsp; together under geometry that's hidden it prevents&nbsp;&nbsp; from closing, but there's two different ways to&nbsp; fix it so I figured it merited its own example.&nbsp;&nbsp; So yeah, let me know if there's another way that&nbsp; you see that you get geometry that doesn't close,&nbsp;&nbsp; and let me know if this helps you. If&nbsp; you've ever had geometry didn't close&nbsp;&nbsp; and maybe there's a tip in here that helps&nbsp; you close it, let me know about that too.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you like that video click like down below&nbsp; and if you haven't already, please subscribe.&nbsp;&nbsp; We create several videos every single week and&nbsp; you'll be notified of each and every one of them&nbsp;&nbsp; if you subscribe.
