Kind: captions Hi, this is Tyson with a winter themed SketchUp Skill Builder for you. Today we'll create snowflakes, and we'll use a method similar to the patterns we created with Components. So let's jump in! To begin our snowflake we'll use the Polygon tool and draw out a five or six or seven or eight sided polygon. And you can change the number of sides by simply typing "5s" hit Enter and now I have five sides. I'm going to do six, so I'm going to do "6s" hit Enter. Six sided polygon. Finish that, and then use the line tool to draw from the endpoint to the center, and then from there out to the midpoint here. And erase the rest of your polygon. Select it, right click, hit Make Component. And we'll just call this "6 sided slice." So, I'm going to start moving this triangle, this slice, and press the option key on a mac, or control key on a PC to make a copy and then mirror this copy by right clicking it and choosing "Flip Along" It'll probably be the Red axis, but it may be the Green. But with this mirrored along this side, move it back so that they're lined up perfectly. Now select both and rotate from this center point down here and again press the option or control key on a PC to make a copy to here. And then I'm going to choose "5x", type "5x" and hit Enter to create five total copies to complete our six sided polygon. Now we can go in and start editing these. To edit any one of these slices I'm simply double clicking on it. You can see everything else grays out and I can start. And you can see how quickly and how easily you can start playing around with patterns. Now I'm going to undo this, and I like to hide my edges from the beginning. So I'm going to use the Eraser tool. I'm still editing this slice. Hold the Shift key down so that I'm hiding and not actually erasing. And now that I've hidden those edges, I'm still going to view them.Go View &gt; Hidden Geometry and let's begin again. Ah, but you can see I'm not editing this component. So that's part of the Skill Builder is remembering when you're editing a Component and not. So, double click. Now let's try that again. So with that done, I'll erase out some edges here. Then maybe come back in with the Move tool. Move some of these points around. And then if I turn off my Hidden Geometry. There's my snowflake. It's easy to make changes as we've already done, or you could grab all of these, make a copy, and then right click and make them all unique. Now we'll come back in. Let's say we'll connect these lines, so we can erase out the changes we made before without affecting over here. And redraw this into something different. But you get the idea. So try it out, have some fun, draw better snowflakes than my weird fish snowflake here. That's ridiculous. Okay, cheers!
