Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at the extension Spacefinder. [Music] So, Spacefinder is an extension that is available from the SketchUp team and it's a cool little extension that goes through your structure, your building, and identifies spaces in the floors. Um, so when I'm talking about spaces, I'm talking about like a room or a section of a building. Uh, and allows you to go in and put information in there and even export some data about square footages and that sort of thing. It's pretty cool. It's pretty easy to use and we're going to check it out right now. All right. So, here this is the extension warehouse page. It is available for free to download and install. Um, it's available through SketchUp Labs. You guys have heard us talk about SketchUp Labs before. a cool place that the SketchUp team is to put up uh different extensions or or additional functionality and you get to try it out. So, let's take a look at how this works. It is a very easy to use extension. So, I have a structure here. Um I've used this on some other videos, too. Very basic, very simple. I have stuff broken apart into uh different groups based on uh how I want to see the data in this in this structure. Um pretty simple structure though. I mean it's not not nearly as many uh tags as I've seen in production drawings, but I just want to see that is is broken apart. Everything's in different groups, top floors, bottom floors, that kind of thing. So let's take a look at what happens when we run Spacefinder on this. So I'm going to go to extension. There's one thing here. I'm going to hit it and it's going to bring up the Spacefinder extension. So, the only thing in here it does, it does give you a quick walkth through of how to do this. It is really a find or you know, walk down the path. There's not a whole lot of places to get lost. So, I'm going to go ahead and hit find spaces. We'll see this analysis setting again. I'll talk about that once we get in there. Um, but I'm going go ahead and hit find spaces. It is going to give me a questionnaire once I come in here. So, uh this is not not going to change your results or anything, but it is good information that uh we get to, you know, take in and take a look at what what are people using it for, that sort of thing. So, please do fill this out real quick the first time you do it especially. And uh yeah, it's uh it's a good a good way for us to know what's going on. All right. So, when we get done, we get a couple of things. we get this UI that comes up that shows us the spaces it found. And we also, if you see in the back, my model changed a little bit. Um, it did go through and it did a couple things. One is it gave me a new view. This view is everything's wireframe except for the identified floors and spaces. See that? And then it also gave me uh a new tag in here called tag folder called SketchUp spaces. If I expand that, it'll give me a another folder inside there for each floor. And then in each floor it will have each of the spaces that it found. So let's take a look at what it found. And I'm going to do that. I could do that through here where we kind of buzz through the model. It's a cool representation, but really the uh the UI that is in the extension is a better way to do this. So if we flip through here real quick, um I have a couple of options. Uh the tag the tabs up at the top, floors, types, and groups. Uh groups are created. So if I want to pull a bunch of spaces together, I can manually create groups. Types are going to be the different types that show up once I have assigned them. So right now I haven't assigned anything. So it's all marked as unassigned. And then of course floors floors each floor that identified. So this is a two-story building, no basement. So this is the first floor, then the second floors up above. You will see these how what would it call it? Unusable spaces. So, these are are potentially I could get into, but they're less than the headroom I decided is the the maximum. So, they get marked with this kind of candy striping. Um, this is over the garage. So, this would potentially be attic space. So, and then of course on the top I have a bunch of spaces right here identified. These are all above the second floor. So, this is all attic space. Um, what I can do with this then is I can actually come in here and I can say, "Okay, let's put some tags on here. Let's call out what these things are." So, right here, I know this is a garage space. So, I'm going to pick it. And when I pick it, I get this little flyyou right here. This lets me actually toggle it. Do I want to see it or not see it, or do I want to actually come in here and ignore it? I don't want to ignore it. I want to assign it. Click assign. And the first thing is to do, it's going to give you a list. And this threw me off the first time I saw it, but these are basically uh classifications. So in this case, this is a residential building. Then I have a couple different options for residential. This is a single family. And then it gets into what are the actual tags that can apply. So I'm going to say, okay, this one is a garage. Now, that's my garage space. And uh as I look through here, let's let's add some more spaces. Um I don't remember what a lot of these spaces are. I think this is a this is a uh like a living room back here. So, we're going to go ahead and assign that. I'll go down. You'll see that when you come back in here, it does remember what subfolder you're in for tags. So, I can just drop right down. I'll put that as living room. Uh this is like a kitchen dining room space. So, I'm going to go ahead and find that and put kitchen right there. And then here we have maybe it's a uh kind of a office space. I'm going to go ahead and assign that. This is a hallway assign. And so it goes pretty quick once I once I get into uh assigning the different pieces. It's it's pretty easy to do. Um back here I have some storage spaces like a pantry kind of thing. So call that storage. Uh this maybe I think is a laundry room or something like that. I don't remember. I don't have laundry room as a type under residential single family. But if I go back to residential, we'll go to multifamily. And there I do have laundry room. It's not going to force you into it's not going to say, "Oh, this is for part of mult multif family." This this tag will go along with it just fine, even though uh laundry room came from a different spot. That's all right. Um again, so many spaces I don't remember. I think this is might be a bathroom or I think this is a bathroom right here. So, let's go ahead and assign that. That's going to be I'm going to go back to residential single family. We'll call that a bathroom. Uh these are actually stairs. Um, so I don't have a a stair stairway in here, but I could call that a void or a shaft space. Um, all right. Then I again, I don't know what some of these spaces are. Um, we'll call this little little nook right here. Maybe this is this is an equipment room. That that could be where my stuff goes. Um, there we go. So once that's done, now if I did come over here to types, I could actually see and highlight the different types as I go through it. That same process I go through for my my second and third floor. Again, like I said, with these spaces that are maybe up in the attic, I could always grab them. I can actually uh come through and assign through this list over here on the side, too, if this is quicker. So here's my 300s. I can click assign type addic uh assign type addic and I could actually go through and and and assign each of the unassigns quickly that way if I wanted to. Um either way works. Either way gets you the same thing. You I did mention how these candy stripe spots aren't getting called out. So in my settings I do have some options here like what is the minimum ceiling height. So anything that's under 1.8 8 m high is going to get that stripe on there as unusable space. If I want to count that in attic space a little bit higher, maybe I want to say anything under like 1 meter, I could slide that down, refine the spaces, and then uh it would actually mark those differently. Um, so once I get each of these, I'll see if I can talk and assign to attic at the same time. Not so well. I'll be honest, not it's it's not I'm not not that quick at that. Um, but once I get that assigned, uh, a couple things are going to happen. So, one thing is out here in the model, you'll see that those colors are showing up over here in my spaces view. And my spaces view can be toggled on and off, too. By the way, it is it is a scene that happens. So, if I want to, I can jump back to my normal model view and jump back into spaces view. These different colored spaces, these rectangles are saved in here into this tag right here. So, I can actually toggle them on and off, too. You might notice if I come in here, um, see if I can see it. Yeah, see see the flickering of my floor there as those two two the space and my flooring fight. I could turn spaces off and then that will go away. So that is an option. But yeah, so I have the option of visualizing here in my model if I want. And then of course uh more useful information. I can come over here and I can actually see what's my square footage for each of these. Um I can take that information manually or I can actually export it. So, I can export. I can click right here. It will give me a spreadsheet breaking all these down by level, by type, uh, with the footages. All that will go out. Um, you see, I do have my visualized square footage. It is listed right here. That does include my attic space. So, I would want to ignore that if I don't want that included in my numbers. But, uh, yeah, pretty quick, pretty easy. And I have this not just totaled, tallied, counted, but included, too. Something you will notice, notice there's a space between the walls. So, it actually does just grab that square footage and not the spots that I that goes underneath the wall. So, it is the actual usable square footage in the model. So, like I said, it is a very quick and easy to use extension. Um, learning it takes about 10 minutes. Uh, how you want to use that, that's up to you. what are you going to do with those that information? Export it, that sort of thing. Give it a try. It's a free extension. So, it is an extension. You do need uh SketchUp for desktop to run it, but if you have any questions, my recommendation would be go try it. It is super simple. It is very easy to use. Um yeah, I there's there's a little bit deeper. There's a couple things you do. If you have custom room types, you can actually create a CSV file and import that. Um but there's not a whole lot more to it. It is just very simple and easy to use. So, go check it out. Try it out. Come back here, let me know what you found, how to use it, some use cases you have or or if you have uh recommendations. There is a button in there, that labs button on the screen. You can click that and you can actually recommend directly to the people who make it, which is a great way to get your input. If you like that video, click like down below.
