Kind: captions Hey guys, I'm Aaron and this is&nbsp; SketchUp Square One where we take&nbsp;&nbsp; a look at the basics of SketchUp. Today&nbsp; we're going to talk about hiding things. So, SketchUp actually has a handful of commands&nbsp; that allow you to hide things from view,&nbsp;&nbsp; you've probably come across the hide command,&nbsp; you may even have seen how to hide things&nbsp;&nbsp; through entity info, or the outliner. We're&nbsp; going to take a look at all of those today,&nbsp;&nbsp; so let's go ahead and hop in. Okay, so&nbsp; one of the things that people come across&nbsp;&nbsp; first is, is the ability to hide things through&nbsp; right-click, if I right-click on any selected item&nbsp;&nbsp; I do get this hide option, here it's also up here&nbsp; under edit, I have this command to hide. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; not a bad command, but it's probably the least&nbsp; ideal way to hide something I recommend to people,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they want to use hide, it's a temporary thing&nbsp; so it's like for a step or two. Like I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; take a look at what's in this box real quick I'll&nbsp; go ahead hit hide I can now see inside the box&nbsp;&nbsp; and then I'm going to go up to edit and say&nbsp; unhide the last thing I hid and it will come back.&nbsp; That's about the only time I think you&nbsp; really want to use hide, generally speaking,&nbsp;&nbsp; the way to go about hiding things&nbsp; is going to be to either use tags&nbsp;&nbsp; or use the outliner over here on the right. So,&nbsp; I have them floating. I'm on a mac so I have my&nbsp;&nbsp; floating windows up, if you're using windows&nbsp; this will be part of the default tab bar,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can expand both tags and outliner. So, what&nbsp; this is going to do is, it is going to allow you&nbsp;&nbsp; to take items and toggle them on and off. So, if&nbsp; I look at outliner, let's look at outliner first,&nbsp;&nbsp; so in here now outliner I have Sumele listed and&nbsp; I have this group listed, there's a little eyeball&nbsp;&nbsp; next to the group, that lets me turn it on and off&nbsp; like that see how easy that is? This is preferred.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what you're not seeing here you'll notice I&nbsp; don't have loose geometry here there's two reasons&nbsp;&nbsp; behind that one the biggest one is probably that&nbsp; I shouldn't have loose geometry in my model. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; loose geometry should only exist as. “I maybe&nbsp; start drawing things” but things like this cube&nbsp;&nbsp; should sooner rather than later end up in a group&nbsp; or component, at that point if I make that a group&nbsp;&nbsp; it's going to show up in the in the outliner and I&nbsp; can toggle that on and off. I'm going to go ahead&nbsp;&nbsp; and explode that just for the example that we're&nbsp; working through right here the other thing of&nbsp;&nbsp; course like I said is tagging so again once your&nbsp; geometry ends up in a group like somali or this&nbsp;&nbsp; this cylinder I have here I can come in and I&nbsp; can create a tag and we'll call this hide me&nbsp;&nbsp; and what I can do is I can take the selected&nbsp; geometry and I can assign it to that tag which I&nbsp;&nbsp; can turn on and off so this is nice because it's a&nbsp; sweeping change I can have a whole bunch of items&nbsp;&nbsp; applied to this tag and turn it on and off as I&nbsp; go the biggest problem with people especially when&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just starting to use sketchup run into is&nbsp; they hide stuff and then they can't get it back&nbsp;&nbsp; so I grab some stuff like this I say okay hide&nbsp; that and then I keep going through working here&nbsp;&nbsp; and then I start drawing something that intersects&nbsp; with hidden geometry or I can't find myself&nbsp;&nbsp; to bring it back or I hit unhide last and it&nbsp; doesn't come back because i've hid something else&nbsp;&nbsp; oh it happens so the best way to find things&nbsp; that are hidden is to come up here under view&nbsp;&nbsp; and you have the option of turning on hidden&nbsp; geometry and hidden objects hidden geometry is&nbsp;&nbsp; going to show me two things one is it is geometry&nbsp; that's hidden so remember I grabbed all this stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; and hit it it's also going to show like soften&nbsp; and smooth lines like I have here on the cylinder&nbsp;&nbsp; hidden geometry is nice because once I turn that&nbsp; on I can do things like oh select this face and&nbsp;&nbsp; unhide it so I can individually unhide pieces you&nbsp; will notice that sumela didn't come back when I&nbsp;&nbsp; hit show hidden geometry if I go back up to view&nbsp; I also have an option called hidden objects hidden&nbsp;&nbsp; objects is going to show groups or components that&nbsp; are hidden they look very similar but because it's&nbsp;&nbsp; not just loose geometry it has its own visibility&nbsp; so again I could right click and say unhide or I&nbsp;&nbsp; could come over here under entity into info while&nbsp; it's highlighted and just click the little eyeball&nbsp;&nbsp; icon to make it visible again something else to&nbsp; note I'm going to go ahead and grab all of this&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm going to say unhide to bring it&nbsp; all back go back up to view I'm going to&nbsp;&nbsp; turn hidden geometry hidden objects off and I'm&nbsp; going to select so this and all of this geometry&nbsp;&nbsp; let's here let's do this let's let's do this&nbsp; right I'm going to grab this cube and make it a&nbsp;&nbsp; separate group so I have two groups now here's my&nbsp; cube group and here's my cylinder group I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to grab both of these items and I'm going to make&nbsp; them into a third group so I got nesting going on&nbsp;&nbsp; now now one of the things you can do with nesting&nbsp; is items inside of larger groups can be hidden the way to do this again is probably to&nbsp; use outliner to do it I know sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; people go well I have so many things in my&nbsp; outliner that it's easier for me to come in&nbsp;&nbsp; here and just select this and say okay hide this&nbsp; temporarily all right now come back now the issue&nbsp;&nbsp; with hiding nested geometry just just throwing&nbsp; this out there is that if you do come in here&nbsp;&nbsp; to edit say unhide and just say unhide all&nbsp; unhide everything that I have hidden right now&nbsp;&nbsp; well my cube didn't come back this&nbsp; is one of the things that people run&nbsp;&nbsp; into and they get panicky and they think&nbsp; they've lost things is hitting unhide all&nbsp;&nbsp; is actually saying what it should say here is&nbsp; unhide all things in current context it's too much&nbsp;&nbsp; to put on here it'll be a lot of words so all is&nbsp; what they got there that's saying anything that's&nbsp;&nbsp; on the current level level being like so if I look&nbsp; here on outliner it's this top layer unhide it&nbsp;&nbsp; in this case what we have so if I go to&nbsp; view and I show my hidden objects again&nbsp;&nbsp; there's this cube unhide all is not going to make&nbsp; it show up unless I go into context so now I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of here now if I say edit unhide all it'll&nbsp; bring it all back so just something to note is as&nbsp;&nbsp; you start using groups and components which you&nbsp; should if you start hiding stuff inside there&nbsp;&nbsp; that unhide is not the most dependable way to&nbsp; bring things back so really in summary is you&nbsp;&nbsp; want to hide things once they are created as&nbsp; groups or components hiding raw geometry is&nbsp;&nbsp; something you do just temporarily like one click&nbsp; and then come back to it otherwise you want to get&nbsp;&nbsp; things into groups either assign them to tags&nbsp; or toggle their visibility through outliner so I know there are probably some people out there&nbsp; who have been using SketchUp for a while who have&nbsp;&nbsp; different workflows who go well I don't do that I&nbsp; hide this and that's fine if you have a workflow&nbsp;&nbsp; that works go for it if you haven't been using&nbsp; hide or you have geometry that's disappearing&nbsp;&nbsp; on you these are some things to take a look at if&nbsp; you like that video go ahead and click like down&nbsp;&nbsp; below and if you haven't already please subscribe&nbsp; we create several videos a week including one of&nbsp;&nbsp; these square one videos every week and you'll&nbsp; be notified of each and every one of them if&nbsp;&nbsp; you subscribe most importantly though please leave&nbsp; us a comment down below have you run into hidden&nbsp;&nbsp; geometry that you couldn't find before do you&nbsp; have a secret about how you use hidden geometry&nbsp;&nbsp; if so we'd love to hear about it we like&nbsp; making these videos a lot we like them,&nbsp;&nbsp; even more, when they're showing&nbsp; something you want to see thank you
