Kind: captions Hey guys, I'm Aaron and this is Sketchup Square&nbsp; One, where we take a look at the fundamentals,&nbsp;&nbsp; the basics of Sketchup. Today we're going to&nbsp; look at a command called 3D text, let's hop&nbsp;&nbsp; right in. Okay, so you can find 3D text under the&nbsp; tools, toolbar, so if I come up to the tools menu&nbsp;&nbsp; I can drop down, its right here, 3D text.&nbsp; It is also, it's not on the default toolbar,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I don't have it up here, you add you can, of&nbsp; course, add it to the default toolbar. It is in&nbsp;&nbsp; the big toolbar, if I go to view - tool palettes&nbsp; on mac - toolbars on windows - and click large&nbsp;&nbsp; toolset, I’ll see it right here. The icon for it&nbsp; is just an extruded capital letter "A" because&nbsp;&nbsp; you know good things start with A. So, what I’m&nbsp; going to do, I’m going to go ahead and start,&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m going to click on, click on this and what it's&nbsp; going to do is going to start by asking you to&nbsp;&nbsp; basically specify the text you want to put&nbsp; in here, so I’m going to type something here. There we go and I have a couple things I can&nbsp; define here, I can define my, this is going to&nbsp;&nbsp; be the alignment from the point I place, so is it&nbsp; going to go from here to the left, is it going to&nbsp;&nbsp; be centered, is it going to fall to the right.&nbsp; If you're doing just a single word like this,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course, it's not going to matter, but if I&nbsp; have multiple lines of text. So, if I go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp; hit return and I'll just type another thing here,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is where it's going to make more of a&nbsp; difference. So, there's my alignment left,&nbsp;&nbsp; here's my alignment right, here's my center&nbsp; alignment. Like I said, it doesn't make&nbsp;&nbsp; too much of a difference if you put one light&nbsp; text and if you put in multiple lines, that's&nbsp;&nbsp; going to affect that. I have some options here&nbsp; if I want to put in filled text or extruded text.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm going to go ahead and put both in. I'm&nbsp; just going to place this first and then we'll&nbsp;&nbsp; come back in again and place it again and we'll&nbsp; dive a little deeper into this so we'll look at&nbsp;&nbsp; what the fonts are, that kind of thing. But right&nbsp; now, it's going to put this text in a Tahoma font,&nbsp;&nbsp; ten inches tall, it's going to be filled and it's&nbsp; going to be extruded one inch. Let's go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp; hit place, so when I hit place, it connects to&nbsp; my mouse, and as I mouse over different surfaces&nbsp;&nbsp; that text is going to automatically align. The&nbsp; intention of 3D text is to place it on surfaces,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can always throw it on the ground, or I could&nbsp; place it on Sumele but the intention is that it&nbsp;&nbsp; automatically snaps to a face. So as I click on&nbsp; a face, it's going to go ahead and just place&nbsp;&nbsp; it right there. Now I see, when it places,&nbsp; let's zoom in here this is what it places,&nbsp;&nbsp; so it makes a group, if I&nbsp; double click into that group&nbsp;&nbsp; it has created these surfaces and extruded&nbsp; them out that one inch that I asked for.&nbsp;&nbsp; So all of this geometry at this point is&nbsp; just geometry, this is not text anymore,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is just geometry I can't go in here and&nbsp; highlight the "E" and change it into a "B"&nbsp;&nbsp; because it's not text. This no longer&nbsp; exists as text, I know I'm reiterating that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the number one question I have, and I'm sure&nbsp; it'll show up in the comments is "can I edit the&nbsp;&nbsp; text once you place it" Once you place it, it's&nbsp; just geometry there are extensions out there that&nbsp;&nbsp; will let you go back and edit I think TomTom has&nbsp; one, but for this portion, it is just placed in,&nbsp;&nbsp; is just geometry at this point. So, I'm going&nbsp; to go in there again, I'm going to go ahead and&nbsp;&nbsp; hit 3D text, we're going to dive in a little&nbsp; little bit deeper here, so we're going to type&nbsp;&nbsp; some more in here, and I'm going to look at some&nbsp; of these options here. So you see that it tells&nbsp;&nbsp; meTahoma ten-inch, but I can't actually change&nbsp; it here. I have to click on the fonts button,&nbsp;&nbsp; the fonts button is going to bring up the system&nbsp; font, so this may look a little bit different if&nbsp;&nbsp; you're on windows than what you're seeing on&nbsp; mac, but the idea here is pretty simple. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can pick the font I want to use, so maybe I'll&nbsp; use a different font here and I'll go with bold,&nbsp;&nbsp; these of course the typeface is going to change&nbsp; based on the font family that sort of thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I can also change the size. So&nbsp; I can say well I want this to be,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's just make it huge let's make it like 24&nbsp; inches and I'm going to hit enter. You do have&nbsp;&nbsp; to hit enter here for that to update over here.&nbsp; The other option I have is I can turn on or off&nbsp;&nbsp; filled or extruded, I'm going to go ahead and&nbsp; do that just so you can see what that does&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm going to go ahead and place that. Look at&nbsp; that so now I have this big two-foot-tall "More"&nbsp;&nbsp; but you'll notice it's just an outline, it's&nbsp; just line work, why would you want to do that?&nbsp;&nbsp; It's called 3D text, well there's some cool&nbsp; stuff you can do with it, so if I drop it&nbsp;&nbsp; right here on this, this big piece up here, this&nbsp; the top of this cube thing, and it is a group so&nbsp;&nbsp; when it's in a group, of course, it's not going to&nbsp; interact with other pieces, so if I move it I can&nbsp;&nbsp; move it around freely, but what I could do with&nbsp; this is I could always, right-click and explode it&nbsp;&nbsp; and when it does that it'll actually break&nbsp; through this material below and let me you&nbsp;&nbsp; know make changes in that geometry. So, just&nbsp; another thing you may want to use that for. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to go ahead go one more time, I'm going to&nbsp; go back into three text and we'll do one that is um... so... I ran out of witty things&nbsp; to type, so I'm just going to type text.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to just fill and not extrude&nbsp; so you can see all the different options,&nbsp;&nbsp; and when I place that here's what that&nbsp; looks like. So that gives me just,&nbsp;&nbsp; literal like flat text with no extrusion&nbsp; and that's just like I said, that is just&nbsp;&nbsp; all that is super simple, now that's just a&nbsp; bunch of lines I can do whatever I want. If&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to I could actually come in here and I&nbsp; could manually extrude this, so if you ever like,&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I want three "text" but I don't want them to&nbsp; all be the same size' or something like that&nbsp;&nbsp; you could always manually push-pull&nbsp; that if you needed to but that's that. So 3D text is actually fairly easy to get the hang&nbsp; of and use, like I said, the biggest thing that&nbsp;&nbsp; people stumble on is they want it to be like a&nbsp; text box that they put in. They type in some text,&nbsp;&nbsp; they put it in, then double click on it later,&nbsp; change it again. Once you place it, it is just&nbsp;&nbsp; geometry. It's boom it's in there, the nice thing&nbsp; is that once it's geometry, it's just geometry. So&nbsp;&nbsp; you can change however you want, anything you&nbsp; want to go in there manipulate, push-pull it,&nbsp;&nbsp; change it, you can always: you can grab text&nbsp; from one set of 3D text and drop it into another,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's just a bunch of geometry at that point.&nbsp; If you like that video, click like down below,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you haven't already please subscribe.&nbsp; We create several videos a week, including&nbsp;&nbsp; one of these Square Ones every week and you'll&nbsp; be notified of each and every one of them if&nbsp;&nbsp; you subscribe.
