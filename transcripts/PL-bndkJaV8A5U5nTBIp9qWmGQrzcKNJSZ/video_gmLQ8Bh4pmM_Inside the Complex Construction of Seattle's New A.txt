Kind: captions Hey, guys. I'm Aaron and we're in Seattle, Washington, at the Seattle Aquarium to learn about the Ocean Pavilion expansion. Today, we're going to learn how THIS was Built in SketchUp! This project is very challenging. We like challenges here. My name is Drew Mark. I'm a Senior Project Manager for Turner Construction. It's unlike any other project that I've ever been on in my 25 year career. How many habitats like this have you been involved with building? I've been involved with multiple aquarium projects on various scales. Are you Turner's aquarium guy? I am an aquarium guy for Turner Construction, yes. Wow. That's awesome. Well hey, can we go in and walk around and check it out? Absolutely. Let's go. Let's go. Currently, we are at the south end of the facility. This is where the public will approach the building. We're looking at an acrylic window that looks up in the reef exhibit. So before you even buy a ticket to enter the aquarium, you'll be able to look up at the exhibit and see the sharks and all the various species swimming around overhead. Well, this is the first glimpse of the major concrete structure. That's the reef exhibit itself, which also holds up the roof and all of the steel around it. – Wow. Aquariums are dense with mechanical, electrical, hydronic and life support systems, and you have sand filters, foam fractionators, U.V. sterilizers, ozone systems, degas towers. And you wouldn't think about this, right? This is the stuff that somebody comes into the aquarium, sees the animals, the habitats. It's awesome. Get to learn some stuff. But you don't think about–yeah, all that water's got to get cleaned and filtered. And, I mean, I have a hard time keeping goldfish alive. So thinking about this level, it’s pretty incredible. That probably didn't fit through that door right there. In aquariums, there's a lot of equipment that are large that don't fit through your conventional doors. So we have to plan those out. Come here real quick. I just want to point this out. Professionals struggle with math, too. Yeah, even the professionals, not just me. Other people struggle with math. So this is the Archipelagos exhibit. This is a separate exhibit within the Ocean Pavilion. It's the second largest exhibit in the facility. This particular structure here was Shotcrete. We have a nozzle and concrete combined with air that actually shoots the concrete and it sticks to the backdrop. And it's built out through the rebar all the way to its final surface. This is called One Ocean Hall. This is the main gallery for the public. You get this beautiful, very complicated feature stair that has helical stringers, very complex to fabricate. Because you need more challenges in a job like this. More challenges. Exactly. We're currently inside the big habitat right now. Exactly. We're standing about four feet above the waterline right now. I know you said how many gallons are in here, but it's kind of hard to. I still can't put it together. This is like. Like, my house can drop right inside of here without ever touching the edge. This is huge. – Massive. And then we poured all of this concrete all in one day. That is that's got to be a feat. Hey, Dave, I hear you're the concrete guy on this job. That's what they say. Have you ever done anything that even came close to a shape like this with concrete? No, no, not even once. In fact, you know, if you probably would have seen my face the first time we saw the rendering of that, I went, “That's not going to be concrete. Don't even kid yourself.” You know, it all started with just crazy ideas of, well, here's what we have to do. So how can we get this done, right? When we do this thing monolithic from zero to just about 40 feet, right. And you're not going to be able to see the bottom of that form, you're not going to know how many yards you've got in, you're not going to know your pour rate ultimately. So we literally took the model and chopped it up into pieces so that they knew, hey, for the first lift that's 40 yards and the second lift that's 20 yards and the third lift that's 35 yards. So that the guys would know real time how much mud is in that hole and what kind of pressure they're putting on the formwork. Because let's be honest, at 40 feet tall and 24 hour pour, if something goes wrong, that's the end. Like, I might as well just pack my bags and leave because, you know, the amount of money it's going to cost us for a screw up. There is no failure. It's you know, we joked about like Apollo 13. There isn't a failure option here. We have to make sure this thing goes right. That's quite a view. Yeah. So, where we're standing is a public roof when it's all said and done. The public will be able to walk across the Overlook Walk structure, which you can kind of see happening off here to the to the north. That connects to the Pike Place Market. – Okay. Walk out onto this area and enjoy this view of the sound, West Seattle, and the Olympic Peninsula and the mountains. Hey, I’m Aaron. Sa. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm a VDC project manager running concrete modeling and the concrete coordination for the Seattle Aquarium. What we're standing right here isn't the finished roof. This isn't actually what we'll be standing on once this is done. There's a steel component to it. There's a hollowcore that goes on top of the steel and the sub-slab what you're seeing we're on right now is poured on top with the hollow core. So on top of this, we're going to have foam. The landscape that's going to cover it is going to be a topping slab with wooden benches and the precast seating all over the perimeter of the roof. I think this is one of the dream come true projects that will really push the boundaries of what modeling and VDC can be taking place on the construction site and actually make it happen. As a VDC manager, you probably live by that model, right? Is that like are you seeing the model in your dreams at night? I just can't stop thinking about that. Yeah. For this project, Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It is an incredible project. Yeah. As much as I love walking around the job site, I couldn't help but wander across the street and check out the existing aquarium. Give you a feel for what the aquarium was like and how the new habitat was going to fit in. The aquarium was great. They had these volunteers that would show you the wildlife and let you actually poke some of it like this little guy who would grab on your finger when you touched him. It was awesome to get questions answered and get permission to touch the wildlife, and we probably would have got in trouble had this guy not been there to tell me what I could touch and not touch. They also had this huge acrylic donut full of jellyfish. You'd sit there and watch them and they would just float around and drift back and back and ... It was awesome. It was a truly beautiful aquarium, amazing wildlife. To fully understand the innovation happening at Turner VDC, we had a talk to Sean Beatty. I started on the project early on during the sales phase, and initially I helped do a lot of the logistics planning for the project, modeling the existing site, the context, starting to understand from a construction standpoint how we were going to phase the construction. SketchUp is a great tool for our logistics planning for a few reasons. One, it's fairly user friendly, and once you get fairly proficient with it, you can do a lot of modeling really quickly. Another great benefit of SketchUp is most of our superintending staff have some SketchUp experience, so I can share the model with our superintendents and it's really harder to do that with other applications. Other applications obviously are more complicated. The licensing is more expensive, while in SketchUp, we have that ability to collaborate really easily. Some of the newer features like Scan Essentials, being able to integrate point clouds of existing conditions wasn't available when we started this project, but that's becoming the standard for our projects moving forward. It's been a real game changer for dialing this stuff in. It's really cool how much they show up. So, this is from scanning the ground you got that level of detail? Yeah. After getting to see a little bit of the modeling process, I got to hang out with VDC engineers Sebastian and Arash and learn a little more about their process. We usually are given the final details and we build the model for construction. But this one was more like design and build process for us. So we basically solved a lot of the details and missing information during this modeling process. I like what I do and I like working with SketchUp especially because it's my main tool. And when you have a new challenge, you just want to use this as an opportunity to learn more. And this was one of those that you, you knew that it was going to be special. Yeah. What's it like to work on something you know is going to have a stamp and leave its mark on Seattle forever? Early on, we really knew this was going to change the face of Seattle. Kind of made me feel that I have to like, kind of push myself a little bit more to make something that later on you would be proud of. And This is the model, just like we got it, a DWG file. You can see it here. It may look cool, but it’s not ready for SketchUp because I need to clean it up and prepare it to get it to LayOut. This Scene is basically just plywood and foam. Right. And I have another Scene for each one of the blocks. This shows the progress and the whole assembly. So the idea is that I could like overlay these. Right. And you see the white out basically. Right. Whatever is just 2D or a vector I could just have as separate. So that way is more efficient with LayOut. And whatever is just background I have it as a rasterized background model. So it looks like in here the idea of saying, you know, here's what looks like from above, here's what it looks should look like in 3D. But like that was enough. That was sufficient information to tell people where these all go. Yeah, they gave me a very good idea of what they wanted because they say we want something like IKEA, like drawings, assembly drawings. And I was like, okay, that's that's like, excellent. Because I know what they mean. They want like, something simple and a sequence that can be easily read. You just got to rename it to a Kzlzflk or something like that. Yeah. Take the vowels out. Yeah. So yeah. That, that's, that's awesome. And to see that in SketchUp and LayOut. Because I mean I don't know if you've heard but like, you can't do big models with LayOut. – No, no. – Can’t do lots of details in LayOut. The thing I like about this project is like, I have some experience with LayOut, but I didn't get the chance to push the, the software to its limits. So this was a great example because there's– I mean, changing pages in LayOut. Like if I would go to the next page, you see how quick they, – Yeah – they refresh. This is, I don’t want to let this go to your head too much but this is this is beautiful LayOut work. This looks awesome. Amazing. Thank you. Yeah, I think it worked out pretty well. So, Sebastian, you just mentioned that this isn't actually your first film project with SketchUp. No, I actually used to work for a, I think, very well known guy in the SketchUp community, Joshua Cohen, Fat Pencil Studio. And you got me on camera working with a computer, working with SketchUp since early on. Yeah. Right. Well, that does make you a SketchUp all star at this point. I guess so, Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. I had a really amazing time walking around Seattle. With the Ocean Pavilion project, the Overlook Walk, and the waterfront revitalization it was amazing to see the changes that were happening. The waterfront used to be capitalized by a double decker highway called the Viaduct, but they sent all the cars underground to make way for pedestrians and bike traffic. It was a blast to walk around Seattle and see landmarks and architecture and oops, looks like somebody forgot to Weld before using Follow Me. I really do appreciate the opportunity to get a behind the scenes look at what will be an iconic piece of the new Seattle waterfront. From the field office, we got to go to their VDC office–which is also their prefab shop–and this is where I got to meet Josh. Hey, Josh. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. So this area here is our prefab shop. This is where we do all of our digital fabrication for all of our jobs. So this is some of the pieces typical that would come off of the CNC machine for the CNC cut formwork. Also makes it very easy to read that inscribing. Yep. Yeah, exactly. All the parts are labeled, so each one of these pieces have a unique spot that goes right into place and we use the model to help locate that so we can look at the model and see that this piece goes exactly right there. And so it says massive amounts of time and crews can actually focus their efforts on doing more complex tasks as opposed to just cutting out pieces of material just to get to the point where they're assembling. The stuff you can't do in a shop like pour concrete. – Exactly. – You got to do that there. Remember back at the beginning when Drew was showing us the oculus, that big piece of acrylic that hangs over the heads of customers? What we had to do is actually produce some formwork to actually make this opening. So that way, when the concrete's poured and you pull the formwork away, you have that opening for them to get the actual acrylic to notch down into. How big is that? This is about 20 feet in diameter. And so we built this in two halves in our shop, shipped out two halves to the site. They bolted it together and they picked this up with a crane and put into place all in one section. We have a lot of ribs that are kind of producing the shape for us, but an added complexity is that there's no straight line in this. Because it's going this direction and this direction. Probably none of those pieces are the same. Right. It's curving in both directions and it is changing in thickness as well. The wall thickness on the bottom is much thicker than it is at the top. On these– I assume these pieces were just shipped, assembled, just like this and shipped. Yes. The survey crew is actually able to use this model. I share this model on Trimble Connect with them and they can actually pull up the the points of all of these locations in the model and then actually shoot those in with a Total Station on site to know where the corner of this formwork needs to go. And so they can utilize this model in 3D on the actual Total Station that they're using and know that the formwork can go in the correct location per the model. That's important. Obviously, we've highlighted the major modeling efforts we've done in terms of concrete, MEP coordination. But there's tons of random smaller models that we help the team figure out issues in 3D that are often somewhat overlooked scopes. One of the features weren’t able to see because they hadn't installed it yet was what they call the bosun chairs. These were a series of seats connected to overhead rails that would allow maintenance workers to get to the lights that were throughout the building. They were about to use a SketchUp model to identify exactly where these rails went and how they would connect. I have a couple of examples here. This coordination clearance. Door swings. Jib cranes. Oh, I also had an elevator model in here. We're trying to make this as realistic as possible and replicate what's going on in the site. It's easy to do it as long as the information's there for us to interpret. Moving forward, we're finding more ways to leverage the model across more deliverables, as well as incorporating more scopes into the review process of modeling. This is where we've gotten some direct information from the field using the Total Station, which is these points. We really wanted to figure out where, you know, where this was and what updates we needed to make to a couple little plates here and there to to verify that when we get this beam into place, that we know exactly where it needs to be and it's all the right size and all that. So I was able to use those points and compare that to the designed location for the embeds, which are shown in gray here. And then I went through and modeled in the orange plates, which align to those corners of those shot points. So there's a direct communication from what the field’s seeing to what we're seeing in the model. And then we can go through and make our recommendation for a plate like this and how we need to, you know, shave off a little bit here and there to make sure we're getting that perfect fit against such a large geometry as the the habitat is here. It's so easy to storytell with SketchUp and manipulate the modeled content and be able to have people follow along with what you're doing. It's just intuitive. This was funny. We asked all the guys in the shop just to get together and have a fake meeting. Gesture towards the screen and talk about some stuff and pretend like you're solving a problem. And then they did. It was amazing to see a team come together and work through a problem live. There were 100 places where we could have stopped and said, “This can't be done.” Right. “We don't know how to solve this. We can't figure this out.” We can work with the design team, we can work with the rebar contractors, we can work with our concrete suppliers, we can work with our formwork guys to figure out the right solutions. And and from there evolved our ultimate means of how we actually got it done. That’s awesome. So, lots of communication, lots of talking, passing stuff back and forth and working together on it. Absolutely. It hasn't fully hit me yet, but I'm sure in, you know, ten years when I'm visiting with my daughter and we're walking through the aquarium, you know, you really get a sense of accomplishment. It's an ambitious project, but it's going to be extremely striking once it's done. And a real case study of what we're capable of construction wise. I want to give a huge thanks to everybody at Turner, who made our stay so informative and so hospitable and a special thanks to our buddy Renzo di Furia. Thanks for watching Built in SketchUp, and we'll see you next time.
