Kind: captions Hey, guys, I'm Aaron and I'm here in Bluff, Utah at the University of Utah’s Design Build campus. We're going to spend some time with Hiroko and Atsushi, and we're going to see how their design build program works to create a residence that was Built in SketchUp. Each year, this graduate architectural program collaborates with the Navajo Nation to design and build a project in Southern Utah. One of the instructors, Hiroko, gave me a tour of this remote campus where they live and work. You heard me right! The students all move down to Bluff for the semester. This is a little different from a lot of college programs. The unique thing is, the students— the same students— will keep going to the end. So they start creation of the concept and then give the key to the client. So this is actually the second semester of this program. The first semester they were in Salt Lake City and that was the design portion. That's where they were—the boring software indoors part. But that was where they were actually learning the process of design. Can you tell us a little bit about what that's like? Yeah, the first couple of weeks we just focus on the culture or history, but we start like, “What is important? What's the concept of the project?” They do interviews and a survey for the site to understand this culture, so they learn. Yeah. You're very intentional about spending time with the client, learning about the Navajo Nation and learning about the people they're building for. They shouldn't assume that whatever they want is what the customer actually wants. The client actually needs. Architecture, we think, is really similar to cooking. Our style is more, like we do barbecue style. So everyone you know, non-skilled or skilled, or homeowners, we just bring the materials and then prepare it, build it, and then cook it and eat together. So, kind of, learn together. All this cooking talk’s got me hungry! Wait ‘til you see what I cooked up later! It's time to head out to the site. I'm super excited to get a chance to see what they've been working on for the last couple months, and maybe see if there's a place I can help out myself. Let's go. We just drove about 15 minutes from the campus to Herman and Judy's place, where they're actually building the new house. So here we're going to get a chance to walk around, see what they're building, and talk to some of the students about their experience. This is gonna be fun. This is where we see how things are really getting built. I caught up with Atsushi, the other instructor, to walk the site. It was so cool to learn that even though this is not a traditional building site, they still have very real design limitations. This is based on the academic calendar of the University of Utah, so we have a competition day. So you have a deadline. Yes. There’s always a deadline. Right. And the students work so hard to complete this project. Yeah. I noticed all the trusses came in two parts. Yes. And they have to be scabbed and put together. That was because of the limitation of the trailer? Yes. We have some limitations. The lengthwise we ask them to use only eight feet long. And also the weight is [limited to what] two people [can carry]. There's no cranes. No crane. And if it's more than that, we cannot use it. [It’s a] big difference between design build in a city or design build in a rural area. I’m really happy to work together with them to design the affordable house that is also helpful for the local community. Sorry— I put the alarm for the safety check. Can I do it right now? Let's hear it! Okay, EVERYONE! 11 A.M., 11 A.M. SAFETY CHECK! I’m doing my safety check. Each student is in charge of one piece of the construction. The exterior roof and water catchment system. Plumbing. The foundation. Expansion plan. The window locations. The HVAC system. The exterior siding. Interiors for the house. Trusses. We all really cared about making sure that this was something that Herman wanted. We were meeting his needs, but we sort of sometimes disagreed on how to do that. I think that was the hardest part for me in design. I know we all cared the same way, but figuring out how to turn that care into a house. —I’m Aaron. —I'm Herman. Nice to meet you. This is your home! Yeah. This is my first house too. It's there. It's real. Yeah, yeah. He built a tarp for us and also refrigerator. All the accommodations. He spoiled us! Yeah. And then second week, he wore a safety vest, and then he joined the concrete spreading crew. Do a little trowel like this. It was great. Yeah. That's pretty amazing. My RV is too small. Well, this is definitely a step up. Yep, I like it. It’s great. Yeah. They say good morning. “Yá’át’ééh abíní” they say that in the morning too. In Navajo. —“Yá’át’ééh abíní?” —Yeah. —Woo! I learned something. Thank you. I like how visual the progress is right now because the first three weeks we were doing the foundation. When it gets to the framing part, you actually see things really show up like a day of work looks like something happened. It just forms the actual house. When I started undergrad, I didn't know any software. Learning SketchUp was very easy and very informative. And I love all the plugins that it has. And it has, compatibility with any other software, which is great. For this project I've used it to design the sun blades and the window locations, using Sefaira to get an understanding of the daylighting, like how much you need to change the elevation of the windows and locations of it. We'll catch up with Delyan later. I'm going back to school later in life. Basically, do I love this enough to feel stupid in front of people less than half my age? And yeah, the answer was yes. So I'm doing it. I honestly am not that great at SketchUp, so I'm just going to be honest. But SketchUp and Sefaira work seamlessly together, and for someone like me to say that— It’s a thumbs up. A little bit down the road when I am sitting behind that desk and I'm thinking a little bit more of the contractor now, or the trade, I know sometimes there's a little bit of buffer between those fields, but as an architect, I'll be like, okay, I understand why you can't move that plumbing pipe, for example. I will change my design a little bit and meet you in the middle. I got to talk to Naren, and he told me about the difference between working in an architecture firm versus working here. Most of the in the field experience that I had, most of us never met the client. It was basically project managers. And this is the first time I actually interacted with a client. And it was a good experience. Yeah. Did you, have you used— Sorry. There's a bug on the back of my head. Welcome to site! So what's been so far your favorite part about this project? I think in all sincerity, it's really getting to know the homeowners. And being able to build a relationship with them and being able to build a home with them for them, and just kind of seeing their excitement along the process. Almost every year, no matter what's happened, the client cries. The homeowner cries. I cry for it too. Yeah. Shed my tears. We’re going to have a house. Dream house. At first it was kind of surprising and shocking for us, for 700 square foot. We were like, “We can’t fit anything!” But now we are like, “Yeah, we can fit this too. We can fit that too.” Yeah. And we have to be flexible with our design. So if anything happens, we can change some items. That's a good thing to learn too: have a plan B. Yeah, exactly. I’m a semiprofessional pizza chef now. How about that? After experiencing the barbecue style of learning and living here, I really came to appreciate the incubation of community, apprenticeship, and a compassion for those who need housing. The day wasn't over yet! After dinner, we all went down to the studio where the students discussed their ideas for taking natural materials and making them into tiles for a design exercise. And then Delyan sat down with me to talk about some interesting design aspects of the project. Basically, in the beginning of last semester, we split into three groups that each designed their own floor plan. And then during the midterm, we combined everything all together. So this is essentially a combination of three different projects coming together. Wow. You wouldn’t know that. I mean you guys blended everything very well and it’s seamless by the time it's done. We couldn't make these studs small enough. Smaller than these over here. So we couldn't push the windows further up. Yeah, nothing messes with a perfect design like reality. Yeah. For sure. We're learning that firsthand now. But that in turn [allowed us to make this] an emergency exit, in return. Because it's only two feet off the ground, they can use it as an emergency exit. And then it having more light into the space, primarily the kitchen. And that's where we added this big window there to kind of accommodate for that, because originally our door had a window in it, and this window didn't exist. The idea was to keep the view towards the East, because that's something that the clients wanted. But after the issue with the lighting not coming deep enough from the South, we added this window as well. So it was a constant, receiving of feedback through the renders, through the model and through the ideas that we had. Every time we had a meeting throughout the semester, we showed them updated versions of the renders, which really helped them understand how the project is coming together, how it's going to look, if they like the colors, if they like the layout, pretty much everything. We used SketchUp primarily to make design decisions and figure out what we could do. That was awesome. I can say was not expecting to cook a wood fire pizza when it came here, but getting to do that and spend time with all these students, learn more about them, see them in their community together, and how building a home was more to them than just a design project. Actually getting on site and using their hands and creating something that was important to somebody else. Just an amazing experience. I can't wait to see what they do next and I can't wait to see you next time. See you.
