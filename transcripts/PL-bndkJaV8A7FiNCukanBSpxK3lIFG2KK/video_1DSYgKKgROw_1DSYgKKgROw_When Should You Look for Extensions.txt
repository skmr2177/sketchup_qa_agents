hey guys I'm Aaron and today I'm going to give you my thoughts on when you should go looking for extensions so we've done a couple videos recently where we talked about you know like uh Mastery of SketchUp and uh one of the things that came up with that is as people get more advanced they tend to use more and more extensions the question came out that was makes perfect sense is well okay Mr smart guy then at what point should I be looking for extensions um and I wanted to address that and talk through that real quick because there's a couple of of thoughts about extensions that I just wanted to share again this is not you know absolute truth across the board this is my opinion as somebody who's been using SketchUp for a little while now and taught a handful a handful of handful of people how to use sketch up um but this would be my advice um so first things first when should you be looking for extensions uh I believe that in order to be the best possible SketchUp user designer type person you can be you should spend as much time as possible learning the native commands and how to use those before you start looking for extensions so you could absolutely install SketchUp and immediately go get profile Builder and then just start drawing walls yeah that is absolutely fine if that's what you're going to do um the issue that comes up with that the thing that people run into is they learn to use the extension and there's a lot of great extensions out there they're super powerful do amazing stuff but there's very few infallible extensions out there which means sooner or later you're probably going to have to use a native tool to clean something up or add something that the the extension doesn't do something like that it's possible that you are okay with working in a little box that says this is what my extension does and nothing else that's cool if that's you most users want to go beyond that one of the things the greatest things about SketchUp is that it's boundless you can make whatever you want in SketchUp you can go models spaceships or houses or watch Parts whatever if you're limited to just what the sketch or just what the extension downloaded can do then you're going to be limited in what you can actually create with SketchUp so for that purpose I always recommend people get the hang of using the fundamentals first if nothing else just make sure you get through the fundamentals campus course uh learn. sketchup.com know how to at least do that before you go any further when it does come time to look for extensions I've identified three different situations where you might want to look into extensions or it would make senses for for anybody who's who's a SketchUp user to to check that out so the the first thing is and this is probably the biggest one is repetitive tasks so if you find yourself doing the same thing over and over and over again and every time you do it it takes you 20 clicks go do this thing that's worth looking for an extension save yourself hundreds of clicks throughout your day by downloading extension yeah that's perfect that's exactly where you want to go look for it um anytime that you can save your time modeling by having a command that automates that stuff this is think of it like a macro right so I mean in in office suite and Adobe and that kind of stuff we have have macros where multiple steps get run in a single click those kind of extensions are huge timesavers and anytime you're in a production uh process where you're modeling similar things over and over again or you have to keep doing this thing those are Lifesavers something that can save you time and you know do a lot of the clicking for you that's a great spot to go looking for an extension the second thing that I would recommend is when you're modeling complex geometry so this is stuff that goes outside of uh the basics I already mentioned something like profile Builder profile Builder is a timesaver because it draws a bunch of stuff at once but it also makes complex stuff like uh railings or you know fencing stuff like that all line up well and and work well uh organic modeling if you're going to use a subdivision tool or Artisan or something like that uh it's stuff that falls outside of the default geometry creation of SketchUp SketchUp is a Surface modeler works really well with hard surface modeling um if once I get into like a lot more smooth shapes and that kind of stuff I want to start looking an extension for that sort of thing so anytime you have geometry that goes beyond what the default tool set is created for that's a great spot to look for uh an extension in those situations that's actually a spot where you can create geometry with extensions that you might not even be able to get to with Native tools so in the first one where I saying just automates or speeds up the process some of those modeling tools are allow you to create geometry that the native tools can't even do or it would be very difficult I guess theoretically you could draw lines and edges in 3D space and create any geometry you want but some of those modeling tools are going to help you to create geometry that very very very difficult to do with just native tools so if you're in a spot where you try to go in the native tools aren't giving you the flexibility aren't giving you the functionality that you need to to create that that's when it's time to look into those extensions the third spot is when I want to go beyond modeling capabilities SketchUp is a 3D modeling tool it doesn't animate it doesn't go deep with data or timelines or production schedules um M Advanced material lists anytime there's additional data beyond the geometry that you're creating in your SketchUp model that is the third time that I would say go check out extensions cuz there's some awesome stuff out there I mean there there are entire workflow and suits of tools that are built on top of SketchUp that allow it to do stuff that it there there's just no way to do in the native SketchUp again that's not a fault that's not missing this is stuff that is put on top of the existing modeling tool to allow you to get more out of it so anytime that you're in that position where you need more information more out of SketchUp than what it as a 3D modeler can can provide that's the third spot to go looking for extensions and there's a bunch out there I mean that's another thing about extensions when you're at that spot where you're like I think I could be doing this more efficiently I think I can go beyond what this is here I need more information when you have those thoughts going through your head if you're working in a bubble if you're isolated I talked about this in the uh you know where are you in your SketchUp Mastery if you're working on your own and you're the only one you know who uses SketchUp it can be hard to understand that there is a better way to do some of these things so I would recommend connecting to our Forum forum. sketchup.com there's a link to it down in the description go hop on there because there's people all over the world on our forum and they can help you find the extension you need or you might have a process you're like I think I got this button down I think I'm doing this efficiently as possible am I right is there a better way to do this is there a different way to do this and they might actually have some input for you it's funny cuz when we working by ourselves and I remember using SketchUp when I was all by myself we're in this and we're like okay I'm the only point of reference so I think I'm doing this right I think I'm doing this efficiently I think I'm doing this great turns out there's an extension out there that would cut my work in half easily uh you don't know unless you ask and that's where our forums come into play and then of course the extension Warehouse going onto the extension warehouse and searching for the workflow that you need help with or the process you want to implement uh can get you a good idea of what's there um but nothing beats asking people right I mean if somebody else has been through it it's great to learn from what they've already got so to recap real quick anytime you have repetitive work you want to speed up anytime you want to create geometry that you can't get to with the native tools or you have additional data processes or workflows that you want to do Beyond 3D geometry creation those are my three spots you should go check out extensions I know this one was a little different from what we do generally speaking on the these videos um I didn't even switch over to screen sharing it just extension Warehouse just sat behind me here uh but I really wanted to share this because I've had this question come up multiple times like when does a pro an expert when do they go to extensions and uh as I tried to boil it down that was as concise as I could be about it so um if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though leave us a comment down below this video exists because of comments from viewers like you we love hearing what you guys need to need to hear in order to get the most out of SketchUp uh I would love to hear if you think that did I miss something is there a different spot you should go for extensions if so let me know about that down below too and if you have an idea that you think would make a good video leave it here like I said this video exists because somebody asked for it we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when it's showing something you want to see thank you
