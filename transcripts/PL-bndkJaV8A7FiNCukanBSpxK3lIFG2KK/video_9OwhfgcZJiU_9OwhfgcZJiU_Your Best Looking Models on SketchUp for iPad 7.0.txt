hey guys I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at some amazing visualization features in SketchUp for [Music] iPad so as of this recording the newest version of SketchUp fryad just came out and well models look like this which is super cool Advanced Materials uh image based lighting uh really amazing things that are make your models look better than ever before and I'm going not talk about we're going to hop in and look at what it is right now all right so here we are in SketchUp for iPad and I have this model open you can see I right off the bat to do anything you can actually see how look at how the colors interact with the light around it um it's in this uh sort of environment it's kind of a sunrise sunset kind of thing so we have this very warm color coming in from the side and as I move the model you can actually see the light play across it I like to zoom in on this this face right here this is black you know a shiny reflective black surface as I go across here like this see how it turns to an orange because it's reflecting the color from that sunrise over here very cool I mean this is this is doing nothing special at this point and I got all this already already happening so this is happening because of two things one is the new materials second is the environment so if we look at uh let's look at the environment first we going to go down here and tap on this new new panels the environments panel you can see I have a cple couple of environments in this model I can switch between them if I switch between them two things happen one is the actual Skydome around changes the second is the lighting on the model changes so you can see that see how that happen see how it went from like a this got this warm low light to just kind of a everywhere bluish light and the background changes Let's uh let's actually look at what makes this up so I'm going to go into this one environment and look here so first thing I have here is the Skydome this is what's going to be wrapped all the way around my model so as I spin my model in 3D space you can see that Sky Dome goes every direction for everywhere for everything for all the all the everies it goes all the way around uh if you look down here so we have the name of it um we have some options in here do we want to use the environment for Reflections those are the the colors the lights that are coming onto the model those are the reflections and then do we want to use is the sky dome if we want to if we like the light but we don't like the Skydome of course we can just turn it off or vice versa if I like the Skydome but don't want to see the reflections on the material I can turn that off and uh I have control over that I also have some options up here so right now it's showing me okay here's what the the sky doome looks like if I turn on set Sun location I will get the ability to actually change where that sun is and where it hits the model from so it's by default it's here right where that the sun is in the sky dome but as I move this around uh you can actually see it'll change how the the Sun hits the model so you can see there see how that changes it takes just a second to figure out where it is but then I'll see a flicker in the materials uh as it changes depending on how high or low that is that sort of thing uh the other thing I could do is I come down here I can change the rotation so I can take the whole Sky Dome and spin it around my model gives you this if I do it all at once it gives you this cool you know time passing of day thing but uh you can change where that Sun's going to hit where that light's going to hit based on where the the sky doome is around the model the other thing I changed here is my exposure so the Sky Dome how light or dark is the sky dome and then how light or dark are those Reflections if I want to I just blast it and wash it out or I could drop it all the way down and then you know no light means no color at all so uh yeah so I have total control over that which is really nice and then again like I said those those change based on the on the sky or the environments you're using um I can download more of those from 3D Warehouse too as part of my subscription all right let's uh so that's pretty cool let's look at some materials um so rather than we're going to go throw a couple new materials on here I just have this just kind of nothing thing back here uh context building but I'm going to go in and I'm going to go ahead and put some new materials I'm to go to my paint bucket I want to get two materials I want to get like a uh uh maybe yeah let's do like wood planks that sounds kind of interesting let's throw wood planks right here and then let's also grab something shiny let's shiny metal me grab the shiny metal and I'm going to put that right there all right so just to start off with let's look at let's look at how these interact so shiny metal is the name gave it away shiny so as I as I typ over like this I'm seeing a hard reflection of that light coming in see I turned orange cuz it's reflecting that orange light my wood planks not so much right because they're not so I'm getting they're getting warmer as they turn more into the Sun but they're not getting overwhelmed the way that the metal is the Metal's totally losing the black color as that Sun Shines on there it's cuz they have different settings so let's go look at what those settings are all my materials are going to have this by the way if I pull up that metal I can see if I come down here the properties I have the same stuff I have before it's metal the size of the material the opacity but if I come down a little bit further I get some options in here um I can turn the colors on and off so I could have just the material versus the the actual color that's in there but I can more importantly this is the important stuff is that metalness and roughness so down here I could say Okay I want I want this to be dull I want to be less reflective and then that will end up changing how much the Sun hits that same with roughness I same take this roughness go back and forth and actually change how much comes in there depending on the materials I might also have a normal which will let me change how how the the the bumpiness or of the material so that's going to apply more to the wood but I can actually change that so change how that material interacts with the the Sun the light that's on there I want to go grab that wood real quick let's go uh let's do this um I'll just go grab it uh we're going to go into it and I can see some stuff like roughness uh the normal this is what I want to look at a little bit more go let's go in here close's look at this wood and there we go uh and then with this normal map I can actually increase and you can see kind of how the lightness and darkness changes how it plays in it because it's changing how the Sun interacts with that bump map of that material same with ambient occlusion I can say want to be real dark so that the occluded Shadows really add a lot of depth or I can just kind of make it real light so it's looks more uh I don't know sunbaked bright but I can change those values and change things like my roughness to make it so that when the Sun hits it when the light hits it there's more play between the light and the dark the high and the low and all that's editable for all materials inside SketchUp and the cool thing about this is I mean it feels like we're playing with rendering values right now but this is the actual working uh materials in sketch up so everything I'm doing here uh you know I can I can come in and I can actually interact with any of this stuff too so I could come push pull a a face out and those values are represented in that new material that gets pulled out so all of this is just it's so cool cuz it's just it's just SketchUp same as it was before it just has this new look and feel over top of it um so if I come down here I do have another material that I put in uh right here so let's zoom on in I just imported this this was a a picture of some tile and the tile material highlight that see it without it you can see is not perfect it's not beautiful right so I didn't crop it very well so I have these skinny tiles and then these big tiles and if you look at it in the light so if I if I uh get my light shining on here it's not it's not exciting it's not fun uh let's see if I can exaggerate my my light a little bit um I don't really have uh my sun shining on here is not the back uh it just it's kind of shining out like it like it's a sticker it's like a big flat piece right so I don't see any bumps or anything like that it's just kind of almost like laminate of tile instead fortunately I can take this imported texture and I can make it more like the other materials so I'm going to do that I'm going to come into my materials I'm going to go to my library I'm scroll all the way to the bottom and here's my material if I click on that and just bring that up uh you can see if I come down here I could turn some of these things on but that's not going to fix everything I could tell it how shiny I want that sort of thing but it's not going to give me a normal map it's not going to fix my my pore cutting and my thin tiles but if I hit this little little button right here generate material that's going to actually take my image run it through AI the AI is going to figure out well how should it line up so it's seamless and then it's also going to look at the color values and figure out what a normal map would look like so in just a few seconds I'll go from having this not tiling well flat laminate looking texture on here to something that's going to look more like real tiles and actually play with the light that comes from the environment so there we go I'm going to go ahead and bring it right back up it is now a tile material so you can see the tiles there uh you can also see look at look at this when I look at light the light reflects on it way better than that flat material before you can also see see how the tiles are picking up the shine more than the grout between so there there's a little bit of resistance that's that normal map in there so if I come down here I have things like it figured out what a good metalness and roughness is but it also figured out how should those tiles how should that GR rout play against the light based on how light and dark it is and I can actually play that up or down and actually see not just look at that not just the grout between the tiles but the actual tiles themselves got some bumpiness so you actually play with that and then same thing because it knows what's high and low I can actually amplify the darkness between the tiles using my ambient occlusion slider so pretty amazing awesome way to bring in simple real world materials and get high quality uh photo based materials right inside SketchUp just with a click of a button so there you go those are the incredible new visualization options you have inside of SketchUp for iPad uh check it out and don't just take our word for it try it out get in there make the best looking models you've ever made on SketchUp for iPad and show us what you can do with it thank you
