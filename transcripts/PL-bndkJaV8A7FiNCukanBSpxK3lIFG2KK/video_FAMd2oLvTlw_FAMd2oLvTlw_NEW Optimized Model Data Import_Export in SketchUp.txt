hey guys I'm Aon and we're going to talk about some interoperability options with SketchUp 2025 specifically we're going to talk about some enhanced IFC interoperability and some Trimble connect stuff uh pretty cool especially if you like things like data in your model or keeping the model consistent across multiple users important interoperability stuff let's take a look all right so first things first uh IFC import so I just imported this model or this this IFC model um and I did skip it I'm sorry but file import IFC and then uh we pull it in that's not the exciting part the exciting part is what happens once it actually gets in here so uh the information the dat that comes in is much more useful much more well organized than ever before so if I come over here let's start with tags when I look at this all the things that are com came in for IFC showed up on their own tags so I don't have to worry about going through and figure out where they're going to be it's all nested under a higher level group so I have this IFC tags group and then based on the tag that was on each member it put it into its own tag visibility here so uh makes it very easy to work through here I can always reassign these too I don't want them all in IFC tags I want to put them into a structural folder something like that I can do that and I don't have to keep the names IFC beam either if I want to just name it beam but it makes it much easier to navigate same thing with the outliner here uh as we as we get into some of this stuff so if I come down here I'm going to go burrow down a little bit we're going we're going to come in here we're going to go grab a beam right so I'm going to come through here and you see uh once I get down here to this point I have those names of each of those individual pieces and then of course the one that I have highlighted a lot of beams came in but the one that I have selected right there of course keep going keep going oh my fingers getting start so much scrolling you can see there a lot of data that I imported here I didn't realize how much stuff I brought in here um but you can actually see all the different pieces are in here they're tagged they're they're nested and uh I can actually get down to the one piece that I want right there uh one of the cool things is once I do select that if I go up here to tools I'm sorry if I go to window and go to component options it's going to show me all the data for that piece so as I look down here it does have some stuff like what is the tag the property sets so in here I have my my tech information my IFC material uh object type name description classification I'm just reading things off the screen at this point but you guys can actually see all the data that comes in with this models is just straight import and all that information is available and it's in here in inside of my SketchUp model and uh something I just wanted to touch on too this isn't this isn't specific to uh importing but one of the things that can happen when you import information import data is it can really mess with your scenes you can see I got a whole lot of scenes across the top here um a nice feature as part of 20 uh 25 version of SketchUp is the ability to control what tags and what scenes go onto what group or what I'm sorry what scenes I can right click here and I can say apply tags to scenes by changing which tags are visible which tags are not so rather than you know something new coming in and always being on every scene I can control that now and apply that only to the places that I want which is really cool um speaking of really cool let's talk about Trimble connect for a second um Trimble connect is a great way to store and share files we all know that but uh some of the functionality that came up right now is it just takes it kind of to the next level so I have this big model here and then separate from the rest of the model I have this crane and it's in a component all its own so if I come in here this is all that's in there uh what I can do is I can take just this component it has to be a component I can't do this with a group or loose geometry but once it's in a component I can hit save out to Trimble connect and then I can tell it all right I want to put this out here I'm going to call it cranes I'm going to save it uh yes I want to overwrite what I already exists super cool now here's the yeah that okay that part wasn't that cool so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to grab my SketchUp for web window and in this window all I've done is I went to file I went to Trimble connect open and open that same component so you can see here I have same thing that was in there that Crane and I'm going to go ahead and paste into this model uh a couple of cement trucks I'm going to do three of them I was always told that when you do landscaping you should have groups of three or five cuz one looks weird even numbers look weird no it isn't Landscaping but I think three is going to look nice anyhow once that's done I've now changed the component so I'm going to hit save that is now saving that back up to Trimble connect and if I go now I'm going to go ahead and move that window back off we're going to go back into SketchUp for desktop and what I can do is I can select this component right click and I'm hit reload from Trimble connect that's going to go grab the updated version of the cranes file hit reload and not only do I have a crane in there now but I have my additional cement trucks not one not two not four but three cement trucks so this is a great way what this allows people to do is work in different locations here on desktop over there in web or it could be two instances of desktop and two people can work on two distinct pieces at the same time and then at any point they want just update and you can see here's the new part new parts there I I don't want to brag about myself but I got pretty close to dropping these cement trucks right where they're supposed to be too a little I was just over the line here but uh that worked out pretty well may want to include things like markings inside the component so I nowhere to put things like that but you can see how that would be useful uh multiple designers can be working on the same model different pieces and updating and checking on where the other model is as quick as a right click and a Reload click there and uh yeah that's some some really cool interoperability options and if you are a SketchUp Studio user you're going to have access to the updated Revit importer and this is something that works better than it ever did before it is Windows so I'm here on my windows and we go to import a Revit file and pull in this downloaded rvt file go ahead click that import and this is going to import the Revit data and convert it over into to sketch up information and once that's imported it's going to tell us what exactly it imported all the pieces uh if there's any issues with importing things like materials and we can see if we look in outliner there's a hierarchy of all those materials it created new tags for all of the imported information um those should match the layers that were imported and the information the data comes along with all of those pieces so I can actually go in and we can burrow down here into the SketchUp model and you can see there in the outliner the information showing up for every Revit family imported all the data and attributes assigned to it and that is all up to date for the newest version in SketchUp Studio 202 so hopefully they like that and if you do work uh in you know together with different file types or you work with uh different multiple users uh you know hopefully that's the stuff that is really going to help make your skch up process your SketchUp modeling your workflows even more efficient than it was before SketchUp 2025 thank you [Music]
