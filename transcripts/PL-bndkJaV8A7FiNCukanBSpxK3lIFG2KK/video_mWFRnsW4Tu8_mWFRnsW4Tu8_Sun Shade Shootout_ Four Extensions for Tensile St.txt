Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at a couple different extensions to make a couple different of sun shades. [Music] We're using sun shades as an example of how to use these tools. But basically, the thing we want to do is make a tensile structure. So, a fabric piece that is held taut, fairly taut between multiple points and has some sort of a sag or give to it. that kind of thing like you'd see in a sun shale or a banner or or something like that. So, we're going to make a couple of these. We're going to use three different sets, no, four different sets of extensions. And uh these were all thought of and and asked for at various points by you guys. So, let's take a look at what they are. All right. So, I have I'm set up here to make some simple, like I said, just some sun shades, some sun sails, whatever you want to call them. And I'm going to use a couple different tools. So the first one I'm going to use is sandbox tools. So this is the the standard. It is an extension. It is a standard extension. This is an extension that is shipped with SketchUp. Um we'll take a look at that. The next one is going to be uh soap skin and bubble. This is an older extension. Uh, in fact, I I think that it's been a while since it's been updated on the 3D warehouse, and some people have even said this doesn't work with the new versions, but it does. It works quite well. Uh, it's just not on the website. It doesn't list newer versions. Uh, but the the thing itself works quite well. Um, and then we're going to look at CurveLoft, which is a great extension from the one and only Fredo. And we're going to double up on that because I've had a couple people ask about Topos Shaper. Topos Shaper is actually a tool that is geared at creating topography primarily off of topographical lines, but it can create geometry that connects together uh geometry as well. Geometry that connects ge well I mean surfaces that connect line segments or something like that. You'll see what it does. Um, so I wanted to give that a shot, too. So, we're going to try these these four different tools, and we're going to see which one is the right one to use for this workflow. All right. So, we're going to start with stock. We're going to start with the standard uh that comes with SketchUp. We're going to look at sandbox tools. So, to do any of these, we need geometry. And many of these will work right off of these lines. So, all I did here, I created this a couple of support structures. And then I had a couple line segments shoot up above it. And uh for these three, which is going to be these these three extensions over here, I have just an arc looping down a little bit. Um that's because these three soap skin and bubble curve and topo shaper are going to work off of these lines to create a swooping geometry. Uh the first one that we're going to use though, sandbox tool is a little bit different because it's going to ask for a flat geometry to start with and then put a swoop onto it from that geometry. So let's do that. Let's look at this. So I have these four lines. I put them in as straight lines for sandbox tools because what we're going to do is we're going to create a new grid. Click here and click here and I'm going click up to here and it's going to create a grid like that. Now uh it will always create a rectangular grid. So, this is the first thing that's that's uh if I was grading, this would be a strike against it is that I'm going to have to come in here and cut this out so that I have just the triangle. And to do that, I'm just going to come in here. I'm going to explode this and then uh just come in and just real quickly erase out the geometry that laps over the edges. So, this is, you know, pretty simple uh process. It does feel a little janky. There's some things I could do to maybe Oops. make it a little bit quicker, but really it's not too Look at that. That one was really close. Uh it's not too difficult to just grab that stuff. And then uh delete that. And then all this, delete that. And then we just got to do it on the other side, too. And no, before anybody asks, I don't know that components would make this any quicker because anytime I repeat anything, somebody's going to say if you did components, you could have done it half as many times. But I have a feeling that setting up two halves of this would have been just as much, if not more work. So anyhow, okay, there we go. So we got that. It's gone. Um, the way that this is going to work, I'm going to grab all of this. I'm going to make it into a group. And then we're going to go into that group and we're going to use this smooth button. And what that's going to do is it's going to give us a a shape that we can push down on. So I'm going to come in here and I'm just going to grab the center. I'm going to push it down. And you can see how that just starts to drop. And we have our little sun shade. Works pretty good. Works pretty simple. The thing that's going to happen with this in particular is it's not going to hold on to the ends perfectly. See? See how uh my support where it started got pushed down a little bit. Um see how this one kind of curved a little less at the top and still got pushed down. So I'm at a little bit of a different space. If I was just doing something quick and dirty and didn't want to download an extension, that would work, but not the ideal. And it's not what the tool is necessarily designed for, but uh you can get something, but maybe not exactly what you want with that. All right, let's move along. Soap, skin, and bubble. The first thing I'm going to do is select the three edges. So, I'm using my three swooping lines this time, and I'm going to hit skin. What that's going to do is going to create a shape that is connected to this exact uh my exact edges. Uh it's going to ask me for divisions. I'm going to say let's let's double that. Let's go to 20 and hit enter. All right, that looks good. Uh when I click it is going to uh or I'm sorry, I hit enter, it's going to connect that up. And you see already I'm getting a better solution than what I had with sandbox tools. That's great. You can see it's kind of bubbling up a little bit, right? See how that's kind of But this might be actually how my tension works on this. I don't I'm not really an expert in tensile structures. But what I can do is I can come in here and I can set uh a pressure. So I can say something like I want to see a pressure positive pressure of 20 and hit enter. And see how that pushed down a little bit more. Let's let's let's go bigger. Let's go like 100 and hit enter. Okay, there I can see see how that's pushing way down. That's pretty cool. And I can do this opposite too. So I can put minus 100. Hit enter and it'll be as if it's blowing up from below. So I think with this something like a 20. That looks pretty good. Maybe 30 just to see a little bit more. Push down a little bit more. But there you go. So that's a great way to get uh a tensile structure in there. Uh soap skin and bubble a free extension. And it despite what it says on on extension warehouse, it does work perfectly well with the newest versions of SketchUp. All right, let's move along. Let's go to CurveLoft. CurveLoft is one of my favorite extensions for modeling organicy flowy type geometry um because it's just so quick and easy. So I have a couple buttons here. I'm going to hit the bottom one and it's going to skin those three edges. It's going to automatically create this nice ordered grid and I'm just going to hit the check mark. There is options in here. We're not going to go deep into this. We're just kind of using the default values on all of them. You can see that's what it gives me. So the the dip the the drop downness drop downedness is all based on the arcs I have in here. If I want to swoop down more, I would put a bigger arc in here. Uh but you can see how that looks. I'm going to turn on my hidden geometry real quick. And you can see the grid that it gave me. So, if I look at the grids thus far over here, I have this nice ordered grid until it comes to the edges. Then I have all these choppy lines jumping around and cutting everything up. Um, over here, a nice ordered grid, but very similar. Uh, soap, Skin, and Bubble did a very similar job of the at the ends of chopping that up. Um, the big difference being that my grid is right against the edge here versus this one, for some reason, it's pushed in a little bit. I don't know. I don't know what the reason it does it. Over here, we do have a perfectly aligned grid. So, it actually changed the direction of the grid. So, it would flow with the shape of the geometry. So, that's pretty nice. Um, all right. I'm going to turn that off just because there's there's too many lines for my eyes. I can't see that. And let's let's try one last one. So, I did have this was because of a request. Can you use too shaper for something like this? Let's give it a shot. I'm going to grab my three lines. I am going to uh hit the button. Oops, wrong button. Topos shaper and uh yeah, let's go for it. Calculate my terrain. Now, topo shaper is made to make terrain. This is what it does. It goes through and it says, "All right, based on these, this is how the the the ground would come together." And it creates this nice, beautiful ordered grid. But you can see right off the bat, it's doing some stuff that's kind of not ideal. And this is not I'm just going to go ahead and generate this. This is not Too Shaper's fault. We are using it in a weird way. Uh so what we end up with is we're going to have a couple different groups here. The bottom that's making it a solid. I'm just going to delete that. You can look right at this. So not perfect, but again, not what it was made for. So, I did want to honor the fact that several people asked about too shaper in this use, but uh probably not what you'd want to actually do there. It does create this beautiful beautiful flowing grid, but again, not the ideal workflow. This is not what Toppo Shaper is made to do. And uh it's it's kind of evident here. So if I was to come in and make a tensel structure or a bunch of tensile structures, I would go towards one of these two, soap skin and bubble or curvealoft. Um, for its simplicity, I like curveoft. The reason I may turn to soap skin and bubble is if I want to have more control on how this bulges down or pops up or anything like that. Um, if I was modeling tensile structures under different loads or something like that and I needed to show this one bulged down more because there's snow on it or something like that, then I'd probably lean towards soap skin and bubble. But it is hard to beat this nice ordered mesh and the smoothness that's created by curveoff. So, uh, yeah. So, there we go. We got three different looks at three different ways to make tensile structures. And I would have to say that uh my personal opinion curve loft is going to give you the best solution. So I know we we compared some apples and oranges there. Um sandbox tools wasn't made to do tensile structures, but you can see how you can use it a little bit. You lose some of the essential pieces like uh those the the points where it was supporting. We can kind of see right right there. uh those those points get pushed around because it's not again not how it's supposed to be used. So it'll work if you're just getting some weird geometry, but really that soap skin and bubble and curve loft are the ones. And I I apologize. I made topo shaper not look awesome. Too shaper is an amazing tool for what it does. This is not what it's supposed to do. So this is kind of an can we turn this sideways and make it do the thing we wanted to do. Um yeah, but probably not as good as a tool that's actually intended to do that. So, uh, yeah, check those out if you if you haven't already. Um, I'll put links to all of them. Uh, Sandbox Tools and Soap Skin and Bubble are available extension warehouse. Uh, CurveLoft and Too Shaper available through SketchUp plug-in store. Check them out. They are all all four of them have their place and they're all great extensions. But, uh, those are all worth checking out. They're all good tools. Um, so if you you do use them, let let us know about that. If you like that content, go ahead and click like down below. If you haven't already, please do subscribe. We create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe. Most importantly though, leave us a comment down below. There's some other use cases you would like to see extensions face off in. Or there other extensions specifically you'd like more detail on. Maybe maybe some of these maybe we want to go deeper with some of these and how they work. Um, let us know about that extension or let us know about that those extensions in the comments. That's what I was shooting for. Uh, or I mean any other ideas you guys have for videos. We like making these videos a lot, but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see. Thank you. [Music]
