hey guys it's Aaron and today we're going to talk about syncing your models between SketchUp and layout this isn't like exactly an advanced idea um it is fairly simple but it is something you're going to want to be very intentional about so there is options as to to how and when you're going to want to update your viewports and layout to show what's new inside of your sketch of mon what has changed and I want to just touch on that we've had several people ask questions about this several people struggle with this uh and there's a couple different things I want to make sure we touch on and uh we're going to do that right now all right so uh I'm in SketchUp right now and I have this model this is the model that I want to take into uh layout I made a couple of scenes I made a side scene so this is just uh a parallel view from the side I made one from the front as well and I have both of these saved they're saved into the model and I took these already into layout and let me just show you my super simple layout model right now TH or my layout document real simple I have a viewport here viewport here both the viewports have the background turned off so I just wanted the model um and you can see they both came came in I started doing some more uh like I started with some uh uh labels here I I got a a call out for each of these uh elevations and everything's going pretty good except I don't like it there are things I can change in here so these are linked to scenes so you can see here I do have these different scenes turned on um my scene for the side you can see right here it is set to scene side um it is have ortho turned on it is 8 in equals a foot um I have preserved scale turned on I have the default Shadow set pretty simple pretty easy this one on the other hand has been changed a little bit if you come through a lot of it's the same um but if I go to my effects I can see Shadows has this reset button here as soon as that reset button shows up it tells you that something has changed from the original model so if I was to hit reset right now uh I would get this little this little uh message this little Caution sign right here shows up the reason this shows up is because I always always always always set my viewports I turn auto render off I do this not because Auto render is bad not because it's a problem to have an auto render but I like control I'm a control freak when I come into my documentation I like to know exactly what's going on when and why I would rather look for for this little triangle and know that I should come up update something rather than have it automatically do that and maybe make a change that I wasn't aware of or didn't want to have happen so by keeping Auto turned off see on both my viewports auto is turned off this means if I want to rerender it I have to come in here and I have to hit render so you can see why I changed that viewport or that that shadow originally the Shadows are a little long they're casting all the way across here so what I did all I did was I just come came in here and I clicked and I uh I changed that time a little bit and then I got a better angle so less less Shadows I still like some Shadows on there I think that looks cool uh but yeah less Shadows um so let's go look through a couple things and see some more spots that I might want to make those changes so watching things like that watching for that reset button or that render button to show up is a big thing watching for the little triangle Mark that is another big thing if that shows up that means you need to make that you've made a change um not a bad thing people see that and go oh no there's a problem with my model it's not a problem Red's a problem yellow is just a heads up that's a good way to remember that so if I look at this model and I go okay uh this one down here if I pick this I can see this is 8 inch equals a foot this one to fit it on the page I had to take to 1 in equals uh 10 ft I don't like that scale it's kind kind of a weird scale uh for for architectural mods as far as what I'm used to I would rather have that E8 inch equals a foot so matches here the problem is that with this uh this wall down here it's kind of a retaining wall around a patio kind of thing uh the it doesn't fit on the screen so I could do a couple things I could chop it off we talked about masking a couple weeks ago in a video I could do some masking to chop that off but I'm going to say in my model I want to hop back over to my model and I just want to turn this retaining wall off I don't want to include it in my documentation so I'm going do that I'm just going to alt Tab and hop back into SketchUp and simple real easy I'm going to select this wall I'm going to right click and hide it and then because I want this to update I'm going to right click on my front scene and I'm going to say update now I'm going to go to file I'm going to hit save that now there's a new version of this file and this new version has an updated front scene so that's what exists right now so if I go hop back over into layout again it doesn't come up and tell me that there's something wrong right it doesn't tell me that right here um if I come in here to file I'm going go to document setup and I'm going to look at my references you can see that my reference here says old so it knows that the content that is on the screen right now is an old cached version a saved version of this skp file that is different from what the actual skp file contains all I have to do to update this is click on it and hit update now again I do not want this to be automatic I do not ever ever ever because I might have the changes that are in my SketchUp file might be something that's inlight it's a thing that I'm considering I'm playing with changing something or something like that maybe maybe I'm going in and adding detail that I don't need to actually have connected to these drawings I don't just because I make a change in SketchUp doesn't mean that my layout file should update all the time so that's why this is a manual process I have the option of updating this I do recommend if you are going back and forth making changes that you just come in here and uh like I said check references when loading this document it checks out automatically it just doesn't do anything with it and that is by Design so I'm going to select that document I'm going to say update that I covered up I covered up the uh Little Triangle showing up I'm going say update that you can see right now it says it's current I'm going to hit close and of course to get that wall to go away I'm going to select that window and I'm going to say render when I do that that goes away and now I have a much smaller model and I could come over here to my scale jump up to 8 inal a foot again I made a change but because this is set to not Auto render I do have to come here and click the render button once I do that it gets bigger um I'm going to have to change my a little bit so one of the things you're seeing right now is as I'm doing this notice how that that uh little thing showing up every time I make a change every time I make a move this is the double-edged sword I suppose um I could take this and I could temporarily turn on auto render while I'm going through doing this right I could I could I could keep it on just long enough for me to get everything moved around and then turn it off again but I would say when you leave this model make sure that that auto is turned off and like I just showed as you make changes to your model make sure you go into document setup and check the status of your linked files as you go make changes it's not going to automatically come up so to just like change your whole layout well I mean it shouldn't you should not have it set that way so you want to make sure you come in and double check that and and change those values or come in and update those files as you make those changes it's a simple thing but it is just a few boxes you you need to check properly to give you the full control and not have it deciding when you should update things um it would be great to just go oh just know when I want something to be changed but unfortunately connecting the save button in SketchUp to your actual documents and layout is just a way to take a wrecking ball to your work while you're not looking so be intentional go through and hit that update button when you want it to be updated and render those windows when they need to be rendered not before hopefully that helped you um we like I said we had lots of questions about that why am I why do I get these little triangles showing up on my drawings why why did I make a change in sketch up and nothing happened this is why if you like that video click like down below and if you haven't already please do subscribe we create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe most importantly though please leave us a comment down below let us know what you thought of this let us know if you have other layout tips you think would make great videos or if you just have some other idea that you think would make a good video for us let us know that too we love hearing from you we read those every one of those comments we like making these videos a lot we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see thank you [Music]
