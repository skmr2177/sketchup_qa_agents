Hey guys, it's Aaron and today we're going to talk about setting up [Music] layout. So any you've been following along with Beyond Desktop, these videos we're making, you'll notice that I'm trying to spend a little bit more time in layout and and and cover some of not the basics, but just kind of coming up to speed on how to use layout to make greatl looking drawings. Um, I have not spent as much time in layout as I want and I'm trying to spend more and I want to share with you guys what I'm learning as I do that. And one of the things that early on has become apparent to me is it's worth spending a couple of minutes to get all of your stuff in layout setup. So, I'm talking about shortcuts, buttons, toolbars, the main your workspace, actually setting up your workspace in layout. And I'm going to give my opinion on that right now. All right. So, here's my workspace. Um, I have my I just have a a scene open on a model right here in the middle. So, we're not not even going to really get into this. What we're going to be looking at is all the rest of the stuff, all the parts and pieces around here. Um, so there's a lot less as far as commands go. There's far less commands in layout than there are in SketchUp. So this static toolbar across the top kind of tends to be the only only real UI I have as far as buttons go. It is editable. I can configure it. So this varies slightly depending if you're on uh Windows or Mac, but you have the ability to customize toolbars and change what's up here. So, like with SketchUp, I would rather use as many shortcuts as possible. So, we're going to talk about shortcuts in just a minute, but there might be a couple things that I would put up here on the toolbar. So, um, one of the ones that I've been using a ton lately is zoom to page. I use the shortcut key for it, though, so I don't really see a reason to put this on there. Um, one of the another So, so we'll talk about that. will make sure you know this is one that I would tap on the keyboard rather than uh using that. But something I do do a lot is when I start putting assets on the page, I write click and align them. So the ones that I see myself using the most often tend to be this uh centering horizontally and vertically. So I'm going to do this. I'm going to put a space right here. So I'll have my my default commands and then a space. And then I'm going to put horizontally center and vertically center. And that will keep me from having to select something, right click, go down to align, fly out, align, and then click uh those align or those those specific things. I can just select select the items I have and boom, center them. I think that's going to be helpful for me. There's a possibility once I use this a little bit, I may, you know what? I'm just going to do it right now. I'm going to put align centers vertically and assign centers horizontally up here as well. That way, if I do have a list of things, I can actually just say, you know, align up all these things rather than just get this thing in the middle. So, I think that's good for right now. Those those are the things I want. Um yeah, for right now. Fortunately, this is always available. Oh, no. I do want I do want fonts. I I click on that all the time. Um, and I have to go up into the window to pull it down. Yeah, that's a big one. I'm going to put another space there, too, actually. There we go. Fonts will be all by itself. Okay, that's a big one cuz fonts uh doesn't reside in one of these panels on the side. Things like line weights, fill, that kind of stuff all sits over here in one of these panels. Fonts is not. Fonts is in a separate window. You do have to go up to windows and and pull down fonts or uh text, I think. So, I'm going to make that shortcut there for sure. So, okay, there we go. Done. There we go. So now I got my default tools. I got my alignment tools, which I use all the time. And then I have a button quickly pull up fonts. Perfect. Love that. Um I mentioned shortcuts. So let's just touch on shortcuts real quick. Uh if I go into settings, this is in a different spot if you're Windows or Mac. Um but if you pull up settings, we go uh towards the bottom is shortcuts. If you click on the shortcuts tab, this works just like in SketchUp. It's going to give you a list of all the commands and then any commands that have a shortcut assigned to them, they'll be shown here to the side. Some of these are already set up. What What I would Here's the thing that I would say. I would say as much as possible, I want my commands in here to line up with my commands in SketchUp. So, here's a handful of them. So, to get into my select, it's space just like SketchUp. Eraser is E. line is L, arc is A, rectangle is R, circle is C, offsets F. So, a lot of these are already set up just the way I would expect them to be, but not all of them. So, scale, which is something I would use, that letter S is assigned to pick style. So, that's okay, but I don't want it that way. I want to I want I want S to be scale. So, I'm going to come here. I'm going to type scale. I could scroll to it, but tools, scale, and then I'm going to put S. It tells me that that's already assigned to something else. We just saw that. That's okay. I want to replace it. I want scale to be S. Love it. Good to go. Um, I can check other other tools. So, if I want to see what move is tools, move. Okay, I better put that on there. M. Oops, I hit enter. Just type M. Type the letter. That's all I got to do. Um, all right. So now I got my I know I got scale. I got Oh, let's see. Rotate. What's rotate set to? Rotate's a tricky one because in SketchUp rotate, which you would think is an R, is an R because rectangles are. So if we move down the letter O, well O is orbit T. So all the letters in rotate are actually used. So Q is the default shortcut tool for rotate because because it looks like a compass, I guess. you know that little Q. Uh there's no rotate. No Q and rotate. We realize that. We can read that. But uh yeah, it's a good one. All right. So, there we go. Root, rotate set to Q. Cool. Now, I got my shortcut key set up. I got my button set up. The other thing I want to spend time on is my panels. So, panels are awesome. I I mean, what a great way to see information and uh you know, have have a bunch of data or or tools available right at my fingertips. Now, this is going to work a little bit different in Windows versus Mac, but it's really more about which panels are visible and where they are. So, I work generally speaking on a letteriz page. So, the stuff that I've created and output has all been something I can print on my home printer. It's all like this. So, that leaves me with these big gray spots on either side when I'm zoomed out. So, what I want to do is I want to set up two sets of panels, one on either side. Uh, this side, uh, I'm going to have my information panels, and this side over here, I'm going to have my properties panels. What does that mean? Well, so that means on this side, I want to have stuff like my SketchUp model, scale drawing. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, and then I also want maybe my pages and layers and scrapbooks. So, those are the things I want on this side. go like that. So, here are my pages or or my my Yes, that's what I want. I want that. And then over here, that means I can have right. So, shape style I probably use the most. I tend to order these in the direction that I'm going to work the most. So, I'm what's at the top. So, I would probably say shape style, then dimensions, then pattern fill are probably the order in which I'm most likely to hit these panels. I'm going to go like that. This one I'm hovering out just slightly from the edge because I want to still have access to my scroll bar. Um, the other thing I could do is I could take this window and slide it in like this a little bit and then slide this out, but I don't like that. I don't like the way that looks. I want this snug against the side and I'd rather drag my toolbar in a little bit. That way I can get to this this one on the left side doesn't have something over there. So I can just plop that all the way against the left. Um so there we go. Um I think that's it. I think that's everything I want. So now to review, I got my buttons at the top. They're the buttons I use the most often. Customized plus the defaults. I have my shortcut keys. So if I want to hit uh M, I hop into move. Q brings me to rotate. Perfect. My shortcuts are set up. My tool panel on both sides are ready to go. I'm ready to start modeling. No, I'm start ready to start creating documents in layout. So, I realize some of that was subjective. Some of that was my opinion. And I also understand that I did this on Mac and the function, the actual way to edit like a tab bar is different from dragging floating panels. I get that and I apologize. Hopefully, that didn't cause confusion or anything. But the most important thing that I wanted to do is have this set up in such a way that when I come into layout, I'm not hunting and pecking, which is what I feel like I do now. When I go into layout, I don't feel like I'm ready to boom, let's start working on a document. I feel like I'm going, okay, where's that icon? Uh, I want to move something. M, no, M's not hooked up. Go click the button. And it doesn't work for me. And I think for me that's one of the things that's preventing me from getting into layout and doing more is I have this broken connection between the way I'm just hoping and start designing in SketchUp and the things I trip over when I get into layout. So if you like that video, click like down below. And if you haven't already, please do subscribe. We create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe. Most importantly though, leave us a comment down below. Is there things in layout that you find yourself tripping on? Is there a specific thing or two that prevents you from getting more out of layout? I'd love to hear about that. Uh because maybe we can help with that. Maybe I can make a video about that or suggest that to somebody. Uh we like making these videos a lot. We like them even more if they're showing something you want to see. Thank you.
