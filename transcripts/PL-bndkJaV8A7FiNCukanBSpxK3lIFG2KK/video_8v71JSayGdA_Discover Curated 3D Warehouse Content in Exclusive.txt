Kind: captions Hey guys, I'm Aaron, and today I want to&nbsp; show you some exclusive content you can&nbsp;&nbsp; only get to if you're a SketchUp subscriber.&nbsp; [Music] That's right. You've asked for it,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're getting it. This is curated content. We're&nbsp; talking about live models, high-end materials,&nbsp;&nbsp; skydomes lighting, all the good stuff, and it's&nbsp; only available with your subscription. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp; take a look at what it is. Let's do it. All right,&nbsp; so here I am. I am on 3D Warehouse, and when you&nbsp;&nbsp; are a subscriber you will have access to this&nbsp; portion of the 3D Warehouse which is SketchUp&nbsp;&nbsp; Content Library. And the libraries are these&nbsp; exclusive curated collections of materials. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have a couple things here. I'm just going to&nbsp; run through each of these so you guys can see&nbsp;&nbsp; what they are. So the first thing is collections.&nbsp; Collections are... collections. These are curated&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces of content that are brought together,&nbsp; held together, in these groups. I mean these,&nbsp;&nbsp; these—I'm trying to come up with the word to&nbsp; describe collections that's not collection—it's,&nbsp;&nbsp; the name says it. These are collections. These&nbsp; are works in progress. So I'm recording this,&nbsp;&nbsp; I apologize guys I'm recording this before these&nbsp; are fully filled in, but by the time you guys&nbsp;&nbsp; get this you should be able to come up in here&nbsp; into collections and see content inside here.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you can see we have different spots here that&nbsp; we're going to be filling in, specific materials:&nbsp;&nbsp; roofing, wood, colors, patterns. All that kind of&nbsp; stuff is going to be in here so it's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot easier to find the materials you're looking&nbsp; for by just going straight into collections. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about some of the content that's actually&nbsp; in here specifically these next three tabs. First&nbsp;&nbsp; thing we're going to look at is models. So we&nbsp; do have a couple of—let's slide that out there—a&nbsp;&nbsp; couple of specific models in here. Some of these&nbsp; are live models. So live models are, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; those models that have presets or settings&nbsp; inside there that help you fine-tune what exactly&nbsp;&nbsp; they are. So these are the most recent models&nbsp; available. You can grab these, you can edit them&nbsp;&nbsp; inside 3D warehouse, and then download the final&nbsp; model right into your SketchUp model, where you&nbsp;&nbsp; can also make additional edits. So live models are&nbsp; great. They are created based on presets that you&nbsp;&nbsp; set up and you can fine-tune these so that, you&nbsp; know, things like a bed can be multiple different&nbsp;&nbsp; beds in your model, and you don't have to model&nbsp; or change or download multiple versions. You can&nbsp;&nbsp; use the attributes in here to change how they&nbsp; look, so that it not only allows you to use one&nbsp;&nbsp; model for multiple uses, but you can fine-tune&nbsp; the geometry, the look and feel of that model&nbsp;&nbsp; so that it actually looks like exactly the thing&nbsp; that you need inside of what you're modeling. So&nbsp;&nbsp; those live models are there. Available as part&nbsp; of the models portion of the Content Library.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second thing in here is materials. So yes,&nbsp; SketchUp 2025 has brand new materials that we put&nbsp;&nbsp; in there. They're great looking materials. They're&nbsp; awesome, but 3D Warehouse has even more. So if you&nbsp;&nbsp; go into wood you see the handful of wood that's in&nbsp; there. That's awesome. It's good stuff. I really&nbsp;&nbsp; like the wood! Wood's one of those things that&nbsp; I get caught up on, because it's, you know, it's&nbsp;&nbsp; got grain, it's easy to see if it repeats, but&nbsp; good looking wood in here, and there's even more&nbsp;&nbsp; wood when we come up onto 3D Warehouse. So it goes&nbsp; way beyond just the wood that is downloaded part&nbsp;&nbsp; of it. And you can see there's different stuff in&nbsp; here too. And see here we have some wood veneer,&nbsp;&nbsp; so it's super shiny, and then down here we got&nbsp; some stuff like some planks, so less shiny, more&nbsp;&nbsp; bumpy. All of that, you know, 2025 visualization&nbsp; goodness is all through all of these materials. So&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see we have some stuff in here too like&nbsp; these 2D images that can be downloaded and used&nbsp;&nbsp; as well. So yeah, awesome, awesome stuff. Check&nbsp; out the materials. Check out what's in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; 581 materials and they're all those PBR materials&nbsp; ready to be downloaded into SketchUp 2025. We also&nbsp;&nbsp; have environments. So this is where environments,&nbsp; the existing environments will go in here,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then as we put more environments up they'll&nbsp; be showing up here. Again, these environments,&nbsp;&nbsp; include the skydome and the lighting scenarios,&nbsp; all that stuff is already in here. So if you do&nbsp;&nbsp; download this into a model it's not just this&nbsp; image. This image is just a representation of&nbsp;&nbsp; all the things that will get downloaded into it.&nbsp; And, again, all of this stuff is available if&nbsp;&nbsp; you subscribe. So you log into 3D Warehouse with&nbsp; your subscription, and then you will be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; actually access any of this, download any of this,&nbsp; into your model, download it onto your hard drive,&nbsp;&nbsp; however you want. You come get it and, it's not&nbsp; random stuff that was just uploaded. These are&nbsp;&nbsp; the curated high-end models that are going to&nbsp; do nothing but take your models to the next&nbsp;&nbsp; level. All right, so go check that out. Go&nbsp; to 3D Warehouse. Make sure you're logged in,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's going to be the one big thing. If you&nbsp; just pull it up and you don't actually have&nbsp;&nbsp; that login make sure you hit that little icon up&nbsp; there in the upper left corner to log in if you&nbsp;&nbsp; haven't already done it, and get logged in. Get&nbsp; in there, and you will get to see these exclusive,&nbsp;&nbsp; models, lights, materials, all the good stuff.&nbsp; Download, and I for one, like I said, I said this&nbsp;&nbsp; in another video too, but I can't wait to see&nbsp; what amazing things you guys create with these,&nbsp;&nbsp; this exclusive content. So looking forward&nbsp; to seeing it. Thank you very much. [Music]
