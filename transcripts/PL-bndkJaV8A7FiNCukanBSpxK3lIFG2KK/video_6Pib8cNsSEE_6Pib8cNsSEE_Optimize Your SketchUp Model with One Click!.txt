Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to take a look at a classic extension, Cleanup. [Music] So, I've been using this extension for years and years and years, and I don't probably use it for all the features that it has in it, but the ones that I do specifically use it for, I use it a lot. I've been using it on live streams, and several people have asked questions about it, and I figured it was time to do a video on it. I may have done a video on this before years ago, but uh let's talk about it. Cleanup from TomTom. So, here's the extension warehouse page. Uh this shows cleanup. It shows TomTom and it talks about what it does. This is what we're going to be doing, too. We're going to be talking about things. Um one note that I just want to call out here because I don't want to forget. It does require a library file, um TT Live, which is TomTom's general uh library extension. And so you do have to have that installed as well when you try to use cleanup. So, and it's actually cleanup and then it has a superscript three. So, it's cleanup to the third power. I don't know. I'm just going to call it cleanup. Just remember that the three is there in case you go looking for it and can't find it otherwise. So, let's talk about what it does. So, after you install cleanup, if you go here to extensions and you come down to cleanup, you have a couple things you can do. You can say clean dot dot dot. Anytime you see a dot dot dot like that in a menu in a program, it means you're going to have another UI show up and you're going to be able to set some more properties. And that's exactly what happens here. Just to note, some of the more popular single cleaning tools are available here that you can just run it. So, I have mentioned this many times. Um, I have used merge faces over and over and over again on live streams. Um, this is a great way to take geometry that repeats and connects but has lines between like this thing in back right here and it connects it all together. So that is that is a a command that I use just on its own to come to cleanup 3. I hit merge faces. But you can run so much more. It can do so much more and that's why I wanted to do this. So we're going to hit the dot dot dot one. And uh just before I do that, if you do get your your settings in the bo box we're about to see all set up, then clean with last settings lets you just do it without having to take a pause in the user interface. But we're going to hit this. All right. When this comes up, we can see we have first off, where should we clean the entire model? Local meaning in context. So if I'm inside of a group or a component, it's just going to just clean that stuff. Or selected. Selected is kind of nice because selected says, you know, I might have a huge model and I don't want to run through this huge model and make all kinds of changes. So maybe I'll just select certain things and say just clean those. I generally have used clean the whole model if I'm working on like a a model of a thing like this or selected if it's a larger model, I only wanted to clean some of it. I've never really used local, but I mean that could make sense if you're modeling properly in groups and you want to clean just the contents of a single container. That would work. Uh we have an option here to validate results and show statistics what got cleaned. That's kind of a nice option to have um just to verify afterwards what all happened. So let's run down here quick. Uh optimizations here. Uh purge unused means it's going to go through in this case the whole model and anything that's not used it's just going to dump out. Same as if you went into uh purge the regular purge command. It's just going to get rid of that extra stuff. Uh, erase hidden geometry. This is a nice option if you get to a point where you you've got, you know, you've got extra geometry, but you've hidden it as you modeled and you just want to get rid of it without going and making it visible and then deleting it. That'll get rid of it. Danger though, if you do have hidden geometry that you intend to use more in the future, it doesn't care. It's going to get rid of it. It's a wrecking ball. Everything in here is unflinching and unapologetic in doing what it does. So, just FYI, uh, erase duplicate faces. This is a nice one if you work with a lot of like complex meshes or imported STLs or something like that. Sometimes you can get multiple faces on top of each other. Multiple faces on top of each other prevent things from being seen as solid. So, that's a good one to clean up. Um, you'll notice that some of these it does if you mouse over it does come up and it gives you a little information. And the warning on this one is that this is a slow process. I don't have any duplicate faces on here, so I'm going to go ahead and turn it off because it's not going to help me on my example model cleaning anything up. Geometry to layer zero is a great one. We always talk about this when you model raw geometry. Faces and edges should always stay on what was formerly known as layer zero. Now it's called untagged, but that base geometry should always stay there. And then groups, components that you create that encapsulate those are the ones that should go onto tags. So, forgive that this is an older extension. TomTom hasn't updated layers. Just pretend that says tags and pretend this says untagged. All right, moving on. Uh, merge identical materials. This is nice because I do this sometimes where I duplicate materials with intention to editing them, but I don't always do that. Uh, I don't always end them. So, so sometimes I'll have the same material in there multiple times. This can start to add up if you duplicate a a high-end image material, something like that. Uh it can start to bloat your model. So, it's a good one. Continuing on down here, co-planer faces. This is the one that I use the most. Um merge co-planer faces. So, this is like right here. All of this is in plane. It's all together, but you can see all this geometry is broken apart. I'll model like this often where I have repeat repeating geometry and just plunk copies together like this and then use uh merge faces to get rid of uh all the edges between. Um and in here we do have the ability to ignore or pay attention to materials or normals. That that is an option there. And then edges uh repair split edges. This happens in SketchUp sometimes where rather than having one continuous edge, it'll be broken into multiple pieces. Erase stray edges if I just have lines just floating around here. That's a good one. And then uh remove edge materials. Um I also have the option to automatically smooth edges based on the angle. So any place. So this is where I would normally grab geometry, go into soft and smooth, and tell it to smooth stuff and then move with the slider. If I know anything less than 30 degrees, I just want smooth, I could turn that on right there. All right. So, right before hitting okay, let's let's look at this model that we're going to run this on. And that's my intention is to run that one time and then that's the results we're going to see. So, uh here's what we got going on. I got some just edges kind of just hanging out over here. So, cleanup should go get rid of those. If I go to view and I hit show hidden objects. No, not objects. Sorry. Hidden geometry. I'll see that I have a copy of one of these pieces over here. Um, let's see what else. Oh, so these edges right here, all my all my edges around the outside. I made a mistake and they're all broken into two. So, what should happen is when I merge, all these faces inside should go away. All these edges are on the outside and I should have one edge that goes all the way across like this. All right. Something else I did, I'm pretending I did this on accident, but of course I did it all on purpose. Um, I applied materials to many of the edges that should stick around. There's no reason for this. So, I applied this red material, but this red material doesn't do anything for me because in my styles, um, oops, no, that was right. In my styles, I have all my edges set to black. If they are by material, I'll see that these ones will show up as red. See how a bunch of those showed up as red. Um, this is a thing that happens because right now I'm saying show all of them as black, but SketchUp is also storing red here, red here, red here, right? So, it's got a bunch of extra data in there that I don't need. So, by getting rid of that information, I'm actually going to help maintain my my size of my file. Couple more things I got. If I go into components and see even though I only have one Aaron in here, I have multiple Aaron copies of components sitting inside the file. So this file, this this component, this SketchUp model is saved inside my main SketchUp model four times right now. I don't need that. Ain't nobody need that. And then the other thing I got is, like I said, I do this occasionally on accident. this color right here, material 15, has been copied one, two, three, four times. So, I don't need all those copies. So, that's the stuff that's not right in this model. And what I'm hoping right now is that I can with one button click get rid of all of it. Edit this in here. One thing I did forget was to mention that I do have some of my There's no groups in here other than the air in here. All the rest of this stuff is raw geometry. And for some reason, I accidentally put some of that geometry on this extra tag. And uh you can see this is why it causes problems because I have geometry that's defined by uh stuff that's on two different layers of visibility. That's a problem. That's not good. Uh so I'm going to want to clean that up as well. So with that, now for real, let's go hop over here. I'm going to go to extensions, cleanup, clean, and then we're going to run this on the whole model. Um, we're going to say no, I want to leave that one off this time. Uh, yeah, merge coer. So, this is all all the same stuff I had on before. Let's go ahead and run cleanup and see what happens. All right. Oh, hello colors box. It's bragging. Um, so yeah, if we look at this the statistics, uh, it reduced 340 edges, 69 faces are gone. uh hidden entities, 114 of them. Um merge four materials, purged some components, uh purge layers, tags, uh extra materials. Yeah. So, so it merged together four materials and then deleted two. And yeah, this took less than a second. So, let's look at our model. Let's scrub through here and see. So, right here, the colors menu came back up, and you see this one material where I had copies of it is gone. So, the copies are gone. That's good. Um, if I come in here, let's look through some of our other stuff. Uh, if I turn on styles and I change to show my materials, you see these ones on the edges stayed black. So, even though they were colored as red, that went away. Obviously, the faces here that were separating these all went away. This is one big solid piece. Now, if I pick on one of these edges, it's one continuous piece rather than a bunch of broken pieces. Um, what else? Oh, we're looking at hidden geometry. And now you can see my hidden geometry here. My stray lines here are gone. What else do we have? Tags. My my main tag. So, everything is on untagged now. Um, so yeah. So, this is what cleanup does. And it does it quickly and easily. Again, I'm going to remind you of this one more time. Just something to to note. Oh, you can see right here. Look what it did. It did uh it took away some of the edges that were defining geometry. See that? So, I had some some extra lines in here showing where my fingers were, where arms are, and those are all gone because I told uh cleanup to merge faces together. It, like I said, I referred to it as a wrecking ball. It's a beautiful, super helpful wrecking ball, but when it comes through, it does what you tell it to do without question. So, something to note is this is why it's kind of nice to go, okay, run clean up on just this group and not everything. But you get the idea. So, it's going to clean everything whether you like it or not. And uh if you save, we're stuck here. We can't go back. So, in theory, I could hit undo, undo, undo to get my component back, then just select everything that's not my component and run it again, and it could give me that. But, uh you get the idea. So, that was way more comprehensive than I was actually planning. We ran through a lot of stuff there. But, uh, yeah, great extension. A wonderful way to clean up your model, get rid of extra stuff. Um, a lot of people, especially when you're like just designing and and just making stuff and figuring out how things are going to work, you end up with things scattered on the ground behind you, right? And clean up will come through and clean that all up. Get rid of those extra lines. Get rid of that hidden geometry. Put everything on layer supposed to. One button push. It's a great tool.

Most importantly though, please do leave us a comment down below. Have you used Cleanup? Is there a function that I did not mention that you use it for? Or is there a different extension you would like to see us highlight on here? For that matter, is there anything you would like us to see? Not like is there anything you'd like? Like you don't like stuff, but is there anything specific that you think we should do look at? Uh because we'd love to hear that. We like making these videos a lot, but we like them even more when they're showing something you want to see. Thank you. [Music]
