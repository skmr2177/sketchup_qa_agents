Kind: captions Hey guys, it's Aaron, and today I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; look at some of the amazing new&nbsp; features in LayOut 2025. [Music] So, we're going to look at the features we can&nbsp; touch and hold and—that's not true either. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; a program, I can't actually touch any of it, but&nbsp; the features that help me go in and actually make&nbsp;&nbsp; amazing LayOut. There's been all kinds of updates&nbsp; to things like performance and that kind of stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's tying in some of the visualization&nbsp; features into LayOut. That's all awesome stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's some stuff right on the surface—how&nbsp; some of the tools work—that I just love,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I want to hop into it, and&nbsp; we'll take a look at it right now. All right. So the first thing—and this is just—I&nbsp; just got to talk about some of this stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of the editing tools are more like SketchUp&nbsp; than they were before. And I think that is just&nbsp;&nbsp; super cool. If you're like me, you came to LayOut&nbsp; through SketchUp. I don't know anybody who started&nbsp;&nbsp; in LayOut and kind of came—actually I&nbsp; have seen people who said they did that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but generally speaking, we get to LayOut through&nbsp; using SketchUp, so we're more familiar with the&nbsp;&nbsp; way SketchUp works. And it's really cool that some&nbsp; of these features work more like LayOut than they&nbsp;&nbsp; did before. So, one of the things is if I want&nbsp; to copy something, move it, the functionality&nbsp;&nbsp; works just like in SketchUp. So I can hit the&nbsp; modifier key to copy once. If I hit it twice,&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a stamp. So with my stamp I can copy&nbsp; things multiple times and every time I click&nbsp;&nbsp; it's going put another copy there. If I want&nbsp; to move something, I can use those arrow keys&nbsp;&nbsp; to inference lock different directions.&nbsp; Super cool. Super easy way, like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you're a SketchUp user to begin with, that,&nbsp; of course, is what you're looking for. That's what&nbsp;&nbsp; you want, you want to be able to do—it goes beyond&nbsp; move, of course, rotate works very similar to the&nbsp;&nbsp; way it does in SketchUp now. Grab a point, click&nbsp; right here, and now I can inference what I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to inference. I want it to line up with this point&nbsp; right here. Super easy. Super simple. Scale, same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. If I click here to scale this, I can grab&nbsp; that inference off of other points. Super easy,&nbsp;&nbsp; the same way I did it before. Or I can, you know,&nbsp; use the angle ones. But the the cool part is,&nbsp;&nbsp; like I said, the fact that I can do that&nbsp; inferencing just like I would in in SketchUp&nbsp;&nbsp; just makes LayOut that much more usable for me.&nbsp; The fact that I don't have to remember that,&nbsp;&nbsp; oh yeah, that the rotate works with the handles,&nbsp; or something like that, nope. It works just like&nbsp;&nbsp; SketchUp does. Might look a little different.&nbsp; I mean that the highlights are a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; different and everything, but the functionality&nbsp; is exactly the same. Works very much like LayOut,&nbsp;&nbsp; or SketchUp does. All right. Another thing that&nbsp; I, I'll be honest, I struggled with this a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit when I started using LayOut, was the the&nbsp; split and glue commands. So, I call it glue,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's join. I'm sorry, split and join. Not the cut&nbsp; and glue. Split and join. The way this works is&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty simple. So, the way it used to work is I'd&nbsp; have to select one piece, I'd say join that with&nbsp;&nbsp; the next piece, join with the next piece, join&nbsp; that next piece. The cool thing is right now you&nbsp;&nbsp; can see as I'm mousing over here I have all these&nbsp; different pieces and I have two different shapes&nbsp;&nbsp; here. This piece up here is a circle split in&nbsp; half connected by a couple of edges, where before&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd have to manually go through and glue all that&nbsp; together, now I can come in here select all of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; hit join—not glue—Join, one time and what I'll&nbsp; get is two different final shapes. See that? Super&nbsp;&nbsp; cool. So I can select a whole bunch of stuff.&nbsp; I can select my entire sheet and hit join once,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it'll join all of it. Likewise, if I&nbsp; want to break it back apart into its pieces&nbsp;&nbsp; I can hit the split button once and it's&nbsp; going to go break that back into those pieces,&nbsp;&nbsp; the different pieces once, so I don't have to do&nbsp; it multiple times. I just click this. Boom, there&nbsp;&nbsp; we go. And I'm split apart. And if I want to join&nbsp; it back together, grab it, join it, done. Super&nbsp;&nbsp; easy. Makes it so much easier to clean up line&nbsp; drawings and that kind of stuff that you create&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of LayOut or imported geometry that makes&nbsp; a much easier. So those are some tool things, like&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, for me the parity, the alignment between&nbsp; SketchUp and LayOut is huge, and it makes it just&nbsp;&nbsp; so much easier for me to use than that—um, oops!&nbsp; I pasted some stuff on here. That's not supposed&nbsp;&nbsp; to—get out of there! get out of there! All right.&nbsp; I did that on accident. This is what this page is&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to look like, because the other thing&nbsp; I want to look at is these images. You guys have&nbsp;&nbsp; probably seen the video where we talked about&nbsp; the changes to visualization in SketchUp 2025,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the cool thing is, of course, those come&nbsp; across into LayOut as well. So when I have a&nbsp;&nbsp; model that I pulled in from SketchUp, when I&nbsp; highlight that model window I'll have effects&nbsp;&nbsp; over here. And in effects I have the stuff I&nbsp; had before, turning shadows and fog on and off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambient occlusion showed up in here last year,&nbsp; and now down at the bottom I can actually change&nbsp;&nbsp; my environments. So I can actually flip between&nbsp; the different environments that I have created&nbsp;&nbsp; inside of SketchUp. And I can just toggle between&nbsp; them here, which is just so cool. The amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; control that I have in my drawings, just more and&nbsp; more every time. And I could do that independently&nbsp;&nbsp; too. So I could turn it off on one and leave it&nbsp; on on the other. Or, you know, even though these&nbsp;&nbsp; two both came out of the exact same model, I can&nbsp; toggle, because they're in a separate viewport,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can toggle that environment separately. Which is&nbsp; really nice. The other thing, speaking of control,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the ability, whereas before to print I'd&nbsp; have to go to File / Print and then choose which&nbsp;&nbsp; pages I want to print. This is super nice, all&nbsp; I have to do is right click right here and just&nbsp;&nbsp; say print, or grab an array right so I can say,&nbsp; well just print, I just want to print my first&nbsp;&nbsp; two pages, and I can say print just those two&nbsp; pages. This is nice because, if you're like me,&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to work on a LayOut document and not&nbsp; finish the entire thing all the time. So I do&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of piecemeal work, where I'll do a page or&nbsp; two and then send it out for review or send it out&nbsp;&nbsp; for update, something like that, and this lets me&nbsp; actually do that a little easier. It's, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's printing the pages isn't so bad through the&nbsp; normal—if you're really good at naming your pages,&nbsp;&nbsp; but sometimes I get a little sloppy with that, and&nbsp; being able to pick the one that I—well actually,&nbsp;&nbsp; look how sloppy I got right here: 1, 2, 3, 5, 4.&nbsp; There we go. Perfect example why it's better to&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to click and print rather than go through&nbsp; the main print command under file. So those are&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the top features in LayOut, and, like I&nbsp; said, on top of that the stuff that we can't see,&nbsp;&nbsp; the performance that's been upgraded better in&nbsp; 2025 than it has ever been before. So those are&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the top LayOut things that I like. There&nbsp; is more than that, but those are the things that&nbsp;&nbsp; will affect my workflow, and I want to show you,&nbsp; these are things that I hear about the most,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait to see what you do with 2025 and&nbsp; the LayOut documents you create. I'm sure they're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be better than anything you created&nbsp; before, and I cannot wait to see them. Thank you.
