Hey guys, it's Aaron and today we're going to use the extension True Bend to build a wicker [Music] basket. If you were here two days ago, we did a quick and low poly wicker basket using PBR materials. So, we imported some materials, put all the PBR magic all over them, and then uh did that. And it was uh it was good. It it looked good. It was cool. um if I do say so myself. Um but this one I wanted to actually go in and model some some wicker. I want to make some overlapping pieces of wood, that kind of thing, and uh actually create the geometry rather than using material. So it's going to make a much bigger file that obviously a lot more faces are going to get created, that sort of thing. We are going to use an extension in True Bend to make this happen, but uh I think what we get out of it is pretty cool. Check it out. All right. So, let's let's do this thing. Let's start. Uh, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a rectangle. So, I'm going come here near the the the base and uh I I don't I'm not drawing this to scale. We'll scale it up after, but I want a rectangle like about that size. And I'm going to raise it up about that big. Uh, I'm going to color that. I'm going to use a lighter material. I like that. Um, the grain's going the wrong way. This should be, you know, a read kind of thing going this way. So, I'll select here. I will go to texture position. When you go to to pull up the texture menu, I'm just pointing out some people struggle with this. Make sure the only thing selected is a single face. If you had double click and have the edges, you won't get texture. If you have a bunch of faces selected, right click, you won't get texture. Texture only shows up if you have a single face. So, I'm going to click that texture position. And then I could use the handles to flip this 90°, but I'm a lazy man, so I'm going to use rotate 90°. There we go. Now I can triple click everything. Paint bucket sample. Click here. And that reorients all the sides go in the same direction. All right. I'm going to click that and make it a group. And I'm going to take it from here to say here. I don't know. and we're going to say something like uh 11x. Okay, that was good. Now, I'm going to start right here and I'm going to draw an edge between the two center points here. And I'm going to do that on until I have three edges, three lines. And now, so they're all the same distance apart. Now, I'm going to grab my arc and go from the middle of one to the middle of the next and pull that out just slightly. I'm going go from here to the middle of the next one. My midpoint. There we go. And click. All right. Now, I'm going to erase all of this. Cool. Now, let's grab this this piece right here. Um, I'm going to actually before I weld it, let's let's duplicate it. I'm going to go grab it. Option copy down to here. Let's say 6x. That should go past the end. Perfect. Um, yeah. Actually, we can take this curve right here and salvage that. Salvage like we have to reuse materials here. Put that down there. All right. So, that comes in. Good. Good. Good. That's what we want. That's everything we need. I'm going triple click and weld all that. All right. Now, I'm going to come down here and we're going to put a rectangle. I'm going to actually move this up slightly and we'll put a rectangle right here on the end. I'm going to hit uh the modifier. So, I'm placing it by the center. I'm going to place it upright. So, something like that. You tell this is this is very specific stuff here. I'm going to kind of play around with this. I'm going to scale that. I'm going to scale about the middle by hitting the modifier key. Make that a little bigger. Okay, that looks good. Yeah, that'll work. Um, the other thing I want to do before I what I'm do is just do a follow me. So, I'm going to make this thing follow here, and it's going to go in and out of the verticals. But before I do that, I want to make sure that it's facing the right way. So, see how it's at a little bit of an angle? That's going to cause a lot of distortion to this geometry, and it might make it difficult to line up the ends. So, what I want to do is I want to take this. I'm going to rotate. I'm going to constrain to vertical. And I'm going to take this midpoint right here and turn it until I am 90° to this piece right here. So, I hovering over here to inference. And then when I come over here, it's going to snap to magenta. Now, I'm 90°. That assures that as this follows, it's not going to jump around and get all weird. Uh, technical modeling term, get all weird, that is. So, I'm going to grab this. Follow me. Click on this piece right here. And there we go. Look at it weave in and out. Oh, beautiful. It's a little exaggerated. I could snug it up, make it a little more tight. But, uh, for what I'm doing, I think that actually looks pretty cool. So, I'm going to pull this up vertically till it's the same as the bottom there. Awesome. And, uh, let's color this. Let's Let's throw some darker material on here. Yes. Thank you. Love it. Oh, look at look at the light in the environment playing off that material. So cool. All right. Um, yeah, that looks good. Let's take that now. Triple click and make it a group. And then I will take it, make a copy of it straight up on top. Uh, obviously that's not good wicker. We need to flip that. So I'm going to select it. I'm going to hit flip. And we're just going to go along the red axis and flip it back the opposite way. Beautiful. Let's grab both of those. And oops. Look at that. I didn't do the I didn't do the [Music] end of uh I need to go do the other two. I didn't make it a component. So I got to change both. There I go. Not doing components. I don't know. I don't know about this guy. Okay, there we go. Now I'll grab both of these. And then we will option copy that straight up. I want to stay straight up because I want to keep everything aligned like that. And let's do that. Uh 2x. All right, there we go. We got our wicker. Um, that looks cool. So, that we're going to take that and we're going to bend it in a circle. But before I do that, before we do that, um, I want to put something along here in the top. So, uh, in, you know, like a thing about like an Easter basket kind of thing. Uh, I'd probably have something like wound or something like that. I'm going to I'm going to cheap out on this a little bit because, uh, you know, I don't want this to be a 80 minute modeling video. So, I'm going to go put a circle right here. I'm going to pull that out so it's just wider. There we go. I'm going to pull that out to the midpoint. So, where these two overlap is going to be the middle and we'll pull it down this way. Same thing. I'm going to go to the midpoint. Right. So, you inference that right there. All right. And then, uh, we'll take that and put this material in there. Yeah, that works. All right. All right, I'm going to make that a group. And I'm going to slide up. I don't like how it's overlapping this material here. So, I'm going to go vertical like like that. Perfect. Awesome. Now, I'm going to take all of that, right click, and make it a new group. Now, we're going to use the extension. So, our extension is True Bend by TomTom. We've showed it on here a couple times. We've showed on here a couple of times. Um, I'm not going to dive real deep into it. You can check out those other videos where we explore it a little bit more. I'm going to keep it simple here. We're going to go to tools. We're going to hit true bend. And oops, I didn't select my Here we go. Tools. We're going to hit true bend. This is parallel to the red axis. It was created parallel to the red axis. So, all I got to do is grab this handle, pull it all the way out, hit enter, and there we go. That has now taken that material, bent it all the way around. Looks pretty cool. It does this. So, I could go with this. I could go here. Let's let's make a copy of this over here because I could in theory just take that and go I I want to go a little bit further. I'm gonna I'm gonna uh actually I'm I'm not going to we're going we're just going to move forward. I'm not going to say whatifs. All right. So, I'm going to undo that. And I want to get a little bit of a a lean to the basket. You know what I mean? So, I'm going to take this. I'm going to rotate it not by a lot. like we're gonna go like maybe like five degrees I think is going to give us a decent amount of tilt. Now, if we do the same exact thing, go to tools, true bend, I'll pull that all the way out and hit enter. There we go. See how we got that little bit of little bit of a a can in there. I don't know if that's the term. One of the things of doing that, it does look good. It it did work. It gave me that little bit of a a you know lean to that, but it also pulled this out of flat from my world axis. So, I do want to make sure that I grab it. I'm just use move and grab these handles and just pull it up till it hits the green axis. There we go. Now, we're flat again. All right, let's wrap this up by putting a wooden bottom in there and a handle on here. Um, here's what I'm going to do. This is going to be the easiest thing I can think to do. Uh, first thing I'm going to do, I'm going to go to move and I'm going to flip this around 180° so that seam is in the back. I could clean that up, too. We could go and explode that and and join those pieces together. But, uh, right now, I'm just going to put it in back. And I'm going to move this over. I want to put this so that the middle of this basket is on the origin. That's going to make it the easiest to put a bottom in it. I'm going to do that by going to move. And see, when I first go into move, I got snap points on the corners. If I hit the mo modifier key down at the bottom. So, if you look at uh the bottom, it's going to tell you what the command is. When we say modifier key, it just means look at the bottom of the screen and see that we don't call out a specific command because depending on your operating system that that button is going to change. I'm on Windows so it's command but on or I'm sorry I'm on Mac so it's command on a on a Windows machine it's different. So that's why we say check the modifier keys. All right. So I'm going to tap that and it's going to go to my edges. I'm going tap it again and it's going to go to faces and I'm grab by the middle of that bottom face. Drop it right there. And then I'm just gonna grab a circle. Pull that out so it just slaps into the material like that. Pull it up just a teeny bit. Oh yeah. All right. I'm gonna triple click. And then I'm going to use the lightwood on that. I love it. Make that a group. So if if if all you're looking for is a basket basket, we're pretty close right there. Oh, I got a little bit I got a little too big. I'm cutting through my material here. Let's go scale. Grab this corner right here. go about the middle and just pull that in uniformly. We go. I'm inside the material. Oh, almost. There we go. Now I'm inside the material. That looks cool. Um, if we're just looking for a basket basket, I could be done. I'm going to go just a touch further because I I need this to be uh an Easter basket. So, I'm going to find one of these one of these points right here that is hidden right now. And I'm just toggling off hidden geometry to find that. I'm going to go across the red axis until we hit the other side. Go hit a point. Come on, baby. There we go. And then I'm going to go up like this. Over along the red, back to this first point again. Back down. And I'm going draw an arc on it like that. Rid of all this other geometry. All I want is that arc. Double click and weld those edges. And then come in here and let's draw another rectangle just like we did on these other pieces facing straight up about the middle. Modifier keys to make that happen. And just something like that. That's fine. And I'm just going to say follow me with that little rectangle. And then the same thing. I'll put the dark wood on this one. Love it. Oh, there we go. So, there it is. Uh, pretty quick, pretty easy. Um, what was that about 10 minutes? Something like that. If you take out the talking time, you know, it's it's it's pretty good. Uh, but I do talk here. So, there we go. Quick and easy wicker basket. Only thing we really needed there was TomTom's True Bend and, uh, we got that geometry in there. So again, two days ago, back on Tuesday, we released a video where we did something similar to this using just PBR materials. Uh I wanted to see what it would take to actually model it though. So um this would in theory be something that you could do without using an extension. Uh it would just be a little more work to like get the you'd have to draw those weaves the the the path that goes in between the upright pieces one at a time to make it can't like that. Each one would have to be consecutively a little bit bigger. You'd have to scale it up as you go. It totally doable. Um but True Bends is just an example of a a great extension that simplifies a process to a single click. um just taking that flat piece and bending it around. Uh it's a great extension. So, we wanted to show that here. This is this is beyond desktop. This is where we go beyond just the desktop tools. That's why we did it. Uh so, hopefully you guys like that. And I threw a couple other tips in there, too. Hopefully, you caught them. If you like that video, click like down below. And if you haven't already, please do subscribe. We create several videos each and every week and you'll be notified of all of them if you subscribe. Most importantly though, leave us a comment down below. Did you try to follow along? I will admit this is probably an intermediate modeling process. Uh I wouldn't call it advanced. It's not nothing in there is super hard, but there I did go through some stuff kind of quickly. So I apologize if it was too fast for you. Hey, we're here forever. Rewind, go watch it again. Uh in fact, actually stop it, reload the video. That way we'll get an extra view. I'm just kidding. Uh but yeah, let me know what you thought of this video. And if you have some other ideas for modeling videos like that, let us know about that. Or if there's extensions out there you think are awesome. In fact, you know what? Anything related to SketchUp and you think it would make a good video, let us know in the comments. We like making these videos a lot, but we'd like even more and they're showing something you want to see. Thank you. [Music]
