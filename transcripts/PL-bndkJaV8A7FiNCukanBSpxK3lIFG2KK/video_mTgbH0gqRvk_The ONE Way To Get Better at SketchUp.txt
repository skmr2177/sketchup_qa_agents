Kind: captions Hey guys, I'm Aaron, and I'm here to tell you the&nbsp; number one way to get better at SketchUp. So yes,&nbsp;&nbsp; we will absolutely be talking about the&nbsp; number one thing to do to get better at&nbsp;&nbsp; SketchUp. That's going to happen. I want&nbsp; to cover some other ways to get better,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they're not the best way, but they are good&nbsp; ways to get better. I want to cover about four or&nbsp;&nbsp; five of these and then I'm also going to tell you&nbsp; the number one way. So before we go any further,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you've watched this channel for a while, or&nbsp; if you have a lot of experience with learning&nbsp;&nbsp; SketchUp yourself, I would love to hear your&nbsp; thoughts before. Don't spoil it by going to&nbsp;&nbsp; the end of the video. Right now, before we go any&nbsp; further, type into the comments what you guess is&nbsp;&nbsp; the number one way to get better at SketchUp.&nbsp; Go ahead and, and type that in right now. I'll wait. Okay, awesome. Now that you've done&nbsp; that let's hop in, and let's look at some&nbsp;&nbsp; of the the ways that you can get better at&nbsp; SketchUp that maybe aren't the ultimate way,&nbsp;&nbsp; but still good things to consider. Let's hop in.&nbsp; All right. So the first thing we're going to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about is SketchUp Campus. So learn.sketchup.com&nbsp; is, especially if you're new to SketchUp,&nbsp;&nbsp; the best possible way to learn SketchUp. So I want&nbsp; to, you know, throw this out there for anybody,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially if you're if you're within the first&nbsp; month or two of using SketchUp and you're looking&nbsp;&nbsp; for ways to do stuff, head over here. I know it's&nbsp; structured learning and some people will go "I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't want to take a class, I just want to start&nbsp; using it." That's cool. That's great. Get in and&nbsp;&nbsp; use it. That's awesome. But to start to learn&nbsp; the basics, to find out where the things are,&nbsp;&nbsp; what the things are, what are we calling them,&nbsp; there's no better way to learn that than right&nbsp;&nbsp; here in SketchUp Campus. So I'm going to&nbsp; say learn.sketchup.com SketchUp Campus is&nbsp;&nbsp; an amazing way to start learning SketchUp. So&nbsp; check that out, absolutely. Especially if you&nbsp;&nbsp; haven't before now. All right. Another thing to&nbsp; do, the great way to learn SketchUp is YouTube.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're here. I'm basically calling out the place&nbsp; that we're hanging out together right this second.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our YouTube channel SketchUp dot, or SketchUp&nbsp; on YouTube.com is a great way to come in here,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm not just I'm not trying to you know blow&nbsp; myself up, we have a team that works on this this&nbsp;&nbsp; content. It is amazing learning content. We&nbsp; do videos every week, any day that we don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a video like this one we have Shorts. Every&nbsp; Friday we do a couple hours of live modeling. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a great way to get more out of SketchUp.&nbsp; And again, like I said, this isn't supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; be self- serving. I'm not here to say subscribe&nbsp; to our channel, but we do put out a lot of con—&nbsp;&nbsp; of information. It is a great way, again, if&nbsp; you're at that intermediate spot and you want&nbsp;&nbsp; to get a little bit better and get regular drips&nbsp; of SketchUp learning, it is a great way to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I would recommend checking it out if you don't&nbsp; already follow us, check out, go subscribe to our&nbsp;&nbsp; channel and we'll get you information on a regular&nbsp; basis. Another great way to learn SketchUp better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another one in that same vein if you are a reader&nbsp; type, I want to just throw out there are several&nbsp;&nbsp; books out there that are great ways to learn more&nbsp; about SketchUp. Some of these books tend to go&nbsp;&nbsp; more towards specific workflows. There's, there's&nbsp; books out there that are specific to construction&nbsp;&nbsp; or landscaping or something like that. There are&nbsp; general purpose books that go from beginning to&nbsp;&nbsp; intermediate. Check out the books that are out&nbsp; there it can be tough. SketchUp puts out a new&nbsp;&nbsp; version of Sketch— a new version every single&nbsp; year. Right? Every year. So we're at, it's 2025,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're on version 2025. I don't want to spoil&nbsp; anything for anybody, but next year 2026, we're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to have a new version. It's probably going&nbsp; to be called 2026, but we'll see. A lot of times,&nbsp;&nbsp; books, books take a while to get printed, written,&nbsp; all that stuff so a lot of times you'll look at&nbsp;&nbsp; books and it'll be like a year or two old is the&nbsp; software they'll show in it. Most of these books&nbsp;&nbsp; the content inside still works, is still fresh.&nbsp; You might not have in the book examples of how to&nbsp;&nbsp; use the most recent changes to the software. The&nbsp; version of the books that I showed probably don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have PBR materials because they were written&nbsp; before that was part of the software. So the&nbsp;&nbsp; newer stuff's not going to be in there but&nbsp; the fundamentals, the foundational modeling,&nbsp;&nbsp; that kind of stuff, is all in there and it's so&nbsp; worth checking out. So, books are another great&nbsp;&nbsp; way to learn more about SketchUp. Another thing,&nbsp; and this is, this is one that goes, I don't know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why we don't talk about this more&nbsp; this is one of my favorite places to learn about&nbsp;&nbsp; SketchUp, is the forum. forums.sketchup.com.&nbsp; This is a forum that is full of SketchUp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes sense, right? So, this is a, this is a user&nbsp; forum so it is, it is primarily manned by SketchUp&nbsp;&nbsp; users. Not necessarily staff like myself, not&nbsp; necessarily Trimble employees, but users. You&nbsp;&nbsp; guys. People go up and volunteer their time to&nbsp; answer questions. If you have a question to ask,&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody might reach out to me and go "Hey, how&nbsp; do I do this thing?" And if it's something I've&nbsp;&nbsp; never done before I'll have to say "I don't know.&nbsp; I have an idea, but I don't know." Asking on the&nbsp;&nbsp; forum you might find somebody who's done the&nbsp; exact same thing you're trying to do and tell&nbsp;&nbsp; you exactly what they went through. It is great&nbsp; because it's not limited to asking me a question&nbsp;&nbsp; on a live stream on Friday. It is putting it out&nbsp; here for tens of thousands of people who come&nbsp;&nbsp; through our forum. So it's a great spot to learn,&nbsp; especially if you have specific questions. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; a rough one, you know, because if, in general "How&nbsp; does Push Pull work?" is one thing but "I have a&nbsp;&nbsp; specific geometry and when I Push Pull it stops&nbsp; at a specific spot, and here's my..." that kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of thing, that's what the forum's made for. Check&nbsp; it out. A great way, great way to learn. But no,&nbsp;&nbsp; so all those things, all those, those four things,&nbsp; SketchUp Campus, YouTube, the SketchUp books that&nbsp;&nbsp; are out there, and the SketchUp community are all&nbsp; amazing ways to learn and get better at SketchUp,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there is one thing, one process that is going&nbsp; to get you better at SketchUp than anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; You ready for it? This is, this is it. This is&nbsp; the big one. And if you haven't already put your&nbsp;&nbsp; idea in, and now that I've eliminated four others&nbsp; go ahead and put it in now. But let's do this,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is: go spend time in SketchUp. So this right&nbsp; here is an example from earlier this week. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; a simple little 10-minute modeling exercise. It's&nbsp; a 3D printable business card holder, but this kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of modeling is the thing that's going to get you&nbsp; better at SketchUp. Not this specifically. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; not saying if you go do this 10-minute modeling&nbsp; you're going to be better. Well, possibly! I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; better is an incremental process. Spending time&nbsp; in SketchUp modeling is THE way to get better&nbsp;&nbsp; at SketchUp. So, you know, when, when you say it&nbsp; like that it just sounds so dumb and obvious and&nbsp;&nbsp; like "Wow, I watched a video for that long for&nbsp; that??" But no, I really wanted to sneak in all&nbsp;&nbsp; those other things too, but it's amazing to watch&nbsp; people— we get people who come through our forum,&nbsp;&nbsp; for example, who just started SketchUp, two weeks&nbsp; they've been in it, and they're wanting to know&nbsp;&nbsp; why they can't do this, or they can't do that, or&nbsp; how come this is so hard for them, and that sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of thing. Because they haven't spent the time.&nbsp; They haven't used the tool. They don't know how&nbsp;&nbsp; to do it. So, if you want to get better at using&nbsp; something, you got to spend time using it. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; those other things that we looked at, those are&nbsp; resources that you should absolutely lean on,&nbsp;&nbsp; don't try to figure stuff out by yourself. Don't&nbsp; bang your head on the wall. Don't try to model&nbsp;&nbsp; something and suffer through the struggles you're&nbsp; having. Get help, for sure, but do it while also&nbsp;&nbsp; using SketchUp. One of the things I have told so&nbsp; many users, especially if you're newer, is get a&nbsp;&nbsp; pet project. If you're using SketchUp for work&nbsp; that's awesome. Do what you got to do for work,&nbsp;&nbsp; but get a pet project. If you're just using it&nbsp; for fun, awesome. Get a pet project. Get something&nbsp;&nbsp; that doesn't have a deadline, that doesn't have&nbsp; to be exact, doesn't have to be perfect, that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could start over at any time, something that is&nbsp; manageable. Don't start trying to model a detailed&nbsp;&nbsp; soccer stadium in your first week in SketchUp,&nbsp; because it's going to drive you crazy. You're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to get upset, and you're going to throw it&nbsp; all away. Model something simple. Model a single&nbsp;&nbsp; chair from the stadium. Model a, I don't know,&nbsp; a soccer ball. That's actually kind of kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; tricky with the geometry, but it is doable.&nbsp; Do those things. Do the little things that&nbsp;&nbsp; you can spend time on, spend your lunch hour,&nbsp; spend your evening on it. That kind of thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; but make it a project that you like. Something&nbsp; that's fun for you and that you can step away or&nbsp;&nbsp; not finish and it's going to be okay. The worst&nbsp; way to try to learn a software from scratch&nbsp;&nbsp; especially is to start from the beginning, under&nbsp; the gun, on production work that you have to get&nbsp;&nbsp; finished. It's a terrible pressure to put yourself&nbsp; under, and it makes it much easier to succeed. If&nbsp;&nbsp; you're an intermediate user and getting better&nbsp; and better a lot of people think they get to the&nbsp;&nbsp; spot and they're like "Well, I've done everything&nbsp; I could. I've already taken the SketchUp Campus&nbsp;&nbsp; courses. I'm already subscribed to YouTube.&nbsp; I watch those videos every week. I'm done."&nbsp;&nbsp; That's great. That information is good, but if&nbsp; you don't practice, if you don't use it regularly,&nbsp;&nbsp; then it doesn't matter how many resources you&nbsp; refer to. You've got to use them in order to&nbsp;&nbsp; help, have them help you grow. So, that's it.&nbsp; Spoiler—that's, well not spoiler, we're at the&nbsp;&nbsp; end so I can't really spoil it, but that's the one&nbsp; thing the one thing you can do to get better using&nbsp;&nbsp; SketchUp, is use SketchUp. If you like that video,&nbsp; click like down below, and if you haven't already&nbsp;&nbsp; please do subscribe. We create several videos each&nbsp; and every week, you'll be notified of all of them&nbsp;&nbsp; if you subscribe. Most importantly though, leave&nbsp; us a comment. If you did leave a comment, did you&nbsp;&nbsp; guess right? Were you close? Did you get off? Were&nbsp; you— do you have something totally out of, just,&nbsp;&nbsp; something I didn't even touch on? Let me know&nbsp; down in the comments, and if you have another&nbsp;&nbsp; idea for a video, if this kind of information&nbsp; is good where we're not necessarily in SketchUp&nbsp;&nbsp; but advising how to learn, let me know about&nbsp; that, or if there's some other specific thing&nbsp;&nbsp; you think we should model or talk about, let&nbsp; us know that too. We like making these videos&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot but we like them even more when they're&nbsp; showing something you want to see. Thank you.
