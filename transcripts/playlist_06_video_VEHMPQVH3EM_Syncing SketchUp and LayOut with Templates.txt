Hey guys, I'm Aaron and today we're going to talk about creating templates in SketchUp that work directly with templates that you create in [Music] Layout. So, we're just scratching the surface of how to use templates and how we can make them work together with this video. What I want to do is something fairly simple. I want to create a template in SketchUp for architectural residential models. And I want this template to have scenes already set up for my most common views of the model. And then uh so I can drop any model in there or create a model in that template and it'll automatically populate. And then I want to link it up to a template in layout as well where when I bring that model in it's already boom boom boom boom the files are just in there. So let's check out how to do that right now. All right. So I have this is just this is just what we're going to work with a couple of example models. So, I got just two residential structures. Um, I'm going to just copy these and paste them around into different files as we work through here. Uh, the theory is you could actually build these from scratch and that sort of thing, but uh I'm not going to model a whole house on a 10-minute video. So, I'm going to start by copying this. I'm just going to right click and you can see these these houses are similar size, but they have different footprint. They're they're definitely different shapes. So, how how they interact with the template is going to change a little bit. That's good because we want to be able to make sure our template is flexible. So, I'm just going to copy uh all of this uh edit and copy that. So, I'm going to grab all that and I'm going to start a brand new model. So, this is just going to pull up uh you know what, actually, let's do this. Let's say file, new from template, and we'll go off of just uh our standard architectural template right here. All right. So, we'll start there. So, we know we're starting from a common place anybody could get to. So, let's go ahead and edit paste. We'll paste in place because we'll drop it right at the origin like it was. All right, that looks pretty good. I don't need TomTom here for this. So, I'm going to start. Like I said, my biggest thing with this is I'm going to create scenes. I could use this to create a whole lot more. I could use this to add tags and all the all the stuff we talked about in the other video on setting up templates. I could include that, but we're going to strict with this one. For this example, we're just going to talk about scenes. So, I'm going to start with one scene, which is kind of my my hero, my pretty. Oh, look at that great house scene. That's kind of what I'm looking for. I want to get the chimney on there. So, I'm come from this side. That looks nice. I like that. Let's go ahead and create a scene. So, I'm go to scenes. I'm going to hit plus. Save as new style. Boom. Good. Create scene. All right. So, there we go. We got that piece. I'm going to save this and I'm just going to call it my hero. I call it isometric or whatever you want, but something that tells me what that is. All right. Now, I'm going to go to my camera and I'm going to go to a front view. Pop that front view. Good. I'm going to go to my camera again and say I want to look at parallel projection. I'm going to look at straight on. Awesome. Uh, I'm going to get rid of a few things. Axes don't come through to layout, so I don't have to worry about getting rid of the axes. If you don't like it, of course, you can go to view and turn axis off. But, uh, more importantly, I want to get rid of this background. You do have control in layout to turn the background on off, but I'm just going to get ahead of it because I know I don't want these two colors in here. I just want us on a white background. So, I'm going to go to styles. I'm going to go to uh here, the third tab right here is backgrounds. I'm going to turn the sky off. I'm going to click on the color for background. Just choose my plain white. There we go. That's what I want to save as my front view. Oh, you know what else I'm going to do? I'm going to go in here to uh my edges and I'm going to turn my profiles off. All right, those are what the things I want to do. That looks awesome. Let's go to scenes. I'm going to hit plus, create a new scene with a new style. Yes. And I'm going to click right now before I forget and call that front. All right. So, I'm going have that front view. And then I want a left and right view and a top view. So, I'm going to make those real quick. So, I'm going to go to camera standard. I'm going to go to left. It's going to flip around to the left. Looks good. plus call that left. And it's important to note that like I said this I'm keeping this as simple as possible because we want to get through this. Uh but you could do this with sections. So I go in and put in sections and save those camera views. Um you could do this with materials. I'm doing this really simple. I could do this with white. I could actually go to change my face style to to just monochrome where it's just white with black lines. whatever works for you, however you want to see this. So, I'm gonna go to my top view also. That's the last one I want to do. And I'm gonna save that. And I'm gonna call it, you'll never guess. I'm gonna call it top. All right. So, there we go. So, I've created that. That looks good. Uh I can flip between these views. One thing I don't like is I don't like necessarily that animation. It takes too long for me. I'm impatient. So, I am going to go to view animation and I'm going to hit my settings. I'm going turn off scene transitions. That means I can just click right here and it's just going to pop through them. That's really important to me personally. All right. So, that looks good. I like that. This is all awesome. Um, I could save this, but I'm not going to. I'm actually going to grab this model. I'm going to take this whole model. I'm going to delete it. And I'm going to say file, save as template. Remember, that's what we're here. We weren't here to make a cool SketchUp model. We were here to make a template. So, I'm going to call this my arch template. And I'm just going to put my initials on here. Nobody else can steal it from me. Save. All right. And this is going to be my default template for right now. That's fine because right now I'm going to be showing this. So, let's go ahead and hit save. All right. So, that's going to close that window. And it actually, for whatever reason, my my secondary monitor is where it try opens new models. But here we go. All right. So, here's here's my template. I have these views though there's nothing showing right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come in here and I'm going to grab my model again. Copy it. And again, this could be this this process could actually be of me modeling. So you could pretend this happens real fast. But I'm going to say edit, paste in place. And boom, my model's in there. And immediately I have these already all set up, right? So I'm going to go ahead and save this. Save as. I'm going to save this to my desktop. And I'm just going to call this her house. We'll call it house one. Save. Now I'm going to go to file. I'm going to hit new. And that's going to bring up a blank file again with that same template because I made it my default. And now I can hop over here to my template examples. Grab my other house. Again, just doing this because I already have them built. C to copy it. And then I come into my blank template. I can say control +b. I'm going to paste it in. Put it right there. And guess what? Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Done. So that's awesome. I can go to So you you will notice if you flip through the two of them because this is a slightly different footprint. They fit on the page a little bit differently. So there is some stuff that I'm going to have to take into account. This is a little bit smaller footprint of a model. So I might have to adjust a little. But there we go. That's that's all of my my views already done. And like I said, this was simple. We could have sections in here. We could have so much more. But this is a start. Let's go ahead and save that. Save as. And we are going to save this as house two. And we'll save it. All right. Now, we are going to hop into layout. And I am going to go to file and I'm going to make a new one. I'm going to choose an existing template. I'm going to go ahead and grab a title block template. Um, I feel modern today. I'm gonna take a size D. I want a large large piece. So, I'm gonna do like this arch. No, let's go. Okay, now I'm spending too much time picking what I want to actually use. So, let's go. Yeah, let's just go to uh architectural dise landscape. Okay, so here is my initial page. Pretty simple. So, I'm going to start by file. I'm going to go to uh insert and I'm going to insert my the one I started first. I'm insert house one. I'm just going to drop it here on the first page. Boom. All right. Awesome. Uh I'm just going to set this up however I would want this first drawing. Great. Oops. Except I did that on the inside page, not the cover page. Cut that X. Hop back over to cover pages. Mistakes happen. It just means you're human. Um I'm going to edit, paste. And then let's resize that. There we go. So there we go. That's our cover page. We come to the inside page. I'm going to go ahead and just paste again to get the the model window in here. But I'm going to take this one and I'm going to say, okay, I don't want that to be the hero. I want it to be the front. Right. There we go. I'm going to grab it. I'm going to say front. It's a some weird scale. I want to make that a standard scale. So I'm going to say quarter inch equals a foot. And there we go. So, that model's in there. Awesome. I'm going to grab this page and I'm going to duplicate it twice. On this page, I'm going to take it and I'm going to slide it over like Whoops. Like that. That's some some very rapid whoopses I just had there. There we go. Resize that like that. And then change that to left. There we go. And I'm going to option move a copy that over here. Change that to right. There we go. Go to page four. Grab this. Change that to top. All right. So, there we go. So, now we have a set of plans pretty quickly, right? So, that's was pretty quick, pretty easy. I'm going to come in here and I'm going to save this as a new template. So, this template is going to be my uh arch. I can't remember what I called the other one. Arch model ad. I'm going to save that. All right. So now I have created this arch model ad uh template. So now if I close out of this one and I say file new, it's going to say okay, what do you want to use? I'm use my templates and there's my arch model ad. I'm going to click on that and it opens it up. And look at it. Opens it. I have all my pages but it's showing my model. Cool thing is this is super easy to change now because I have models based off of the same template that this model was in SketchUp. I can swap it out in layout real quick. Watch this. File document setup. And in document setup, bring this over here. If I go to my references, it tells me that it's using house one. If I say relink, I can say use house two instead. I want to click open. Now that's updated. If I hit close now, we're just going to come in here. So, uhoh, what happened? Oh, I just didn't register the first one. Ha. No, that was a fake. What happened? I knew what happened. Um, but there we go. So, with that, we have our new house here. Inside page done, our profiles done. Our top done. So, something to remember is all of these are in here as quarter inch equals a foot. They're also all in here as where this model is relative to the main page. So, some stuff you might have to change around a little bit, right? So, I might come in here to this one and to get that centered, maybe I'll just kind of resize this a little bit. Be so big. And I can scoot this over so that page is in the middle. Something like that. Come over here. Same thing here. Right. Scoot this one this way. Scoot this one this way. Um, grab this. Oops. Get that in the middle. There we go. Shrink that down a little bit so it's not lapping outside. So there you go. So yeah, it takes a couple seconds to get those pages lined up again, but because the template's there, I spent a couple seconds remove moving model windows around instead of recreating that stuff. And again, this was a super simple template. Super simple template. What we could have actually put in here too is I could have come in and I could have put in, you know, title blocks for each of the pages. I could have put my standard disclaimer text. I could have put uh a scale bar on here. I could have filled out uh you know auto text in my title block. I could have done all that stuff so that when I switched that model it all would have updated automatically. So very powerful makes it very quick and very very easy to create drawings if the stuff you do is fairly consistent. Right? So, not so by by fairly consistent, I just mean like if if one house is a 1500 foot house and the next building I work on is a shopping mall, the s same template is probably not going to be awesome. But if I have, you know, work off of similar size models one time after another and save a ton of time by having templates that talk to each other from SketchUp to layout by literally a click to update them. So, that's kind of what we've been leading towards with all of these template videos we've been doing. We talked about SketchUp templates for a little while. We did a thing on layout templates. Um, we've talked about auto text. We talk about a lot of stuff and all the setting up. And this is kind of where it comes together. Giving you the ability to take those pieces and connect them together. And all that works by scenes, by the way. As long as that scene's the same name, it's just going to just bring it over, plop it in. Super simple. A lot of people, myself included, I started working layout. Oh, it's too complicated to understand what's happening. It's not complicated. It's actually pretty simple. It's pretty straightforward. Uh so check that out. Try it out. Let me know what you think.
